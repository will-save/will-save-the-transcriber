**[00:01:55 - 00:01:57]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:57]** That was quite terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** I got you.

**[00:01:59 - 00:01:59]** I am.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** It was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:02]** We will never be a barbershop quartet.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:05]** I'm going to auto-tune it so it sounds fucking right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:05]** Right.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** I see.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:08]** I now know why you asked about that pitch correction plug-in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:09]** Yeah.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** Just wanted to know.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** Actually, I think Logic put one in there.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** Logic has a native pitch correction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** It's good.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** You know what I'm so impressed?

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:20]** T-Pain.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** T-Pain really impressed me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:25]** Dude, Teddy Payne has chops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Hey, sorry.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** Theodore Payne.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Theodore Payne.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Theodore Roselle Payne.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:34]** No spoilers, but he was on a show where they hide.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:37]** Yeah, he was a mass singer.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:40]** He was a mass singer.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:44]** When he took off the mask, everybody was so amazed by it because they were like, wait, he's not auto-tuned?

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:48]** And it turns out he just did auto-tune because it was cool at the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:51]** Purely a stylistic choice.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:54]** His most recent album is just like...

**[00:02:54 - 00:03:17]** okay why why does everyone think i can't sing so he he did an entire album of covers country oh nice oh yeah they're so good they're really good yeah well he got that uh residency after he put out the album and recorded a live album of more covers as part of his residency


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:21]** Because that's all his residency is, is him f***ing around with a microphone and a band.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** Dude, what more do you need?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** That sounds awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:27]** He sings country, blues.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** He sang the National Anthem one night.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:32]** Because I follow him on social medias.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** Not only that, he's a hilarious dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:41]** I do have to say, he's the second best hip-hop artist to cover country that I've ever heard.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** Who's the first?

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** Chance the Rapper.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:57]** Chance the Rapper did a country version of It's Getting Hot In Here as part of the musical impressions with Jimmy Fallon.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:59]** Jimmy Kimmel, one of those Jimmys.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** It is a bop.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** Let me tell you.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:06]** They go in and he starts directing the band.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:10]** He does more than just the verse.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:14]** He does a couple of verses and a fat chorus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** Drop that link.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:21]** Also, Beyonce's country album was great.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** I like Blackbird especially.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** I have a question about someone.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:29]** I recently found out more about DJ Khaled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:33]** And I somehow unfortunately stopped.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:33]** DJ Khaled!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:36]** Yeah, I feel like he's an idiot, right?

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** I'm just making sure that I'm not the only person who thinks that.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** He's not.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** I think he puts on a persona.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** Okay, but that persona's wrong.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** It's an act.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:48]** Because he's never not that guy.

**[00:04:48 - 00:05:09]** and another one have you seen the breakfast thing no the breakfast thing oh my god i'll drop the link too it's the worst i i if he better be playing a character because i mean he's so successful like how you can't be dumb and be that successful yeah look


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:11]** He's got some savvy.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:14]** But I love all the songs he's touched.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:16]** And every song he touches, he lets you know he's in it.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:18]** Because he's like, another one.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** That's his entire life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:27]** And that's all that we're referencing here is his abilities to lay in the intro parts of the track and his production.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** I don't like it.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** That's what I think it is.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:34]** It's like he puts on this front of being like this goofy, like, hey, I'm just going to throw my name out there.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:40]** But I think in reality, he's doing a lot behind the scenes and he's a producer more than an entertainer.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:41]** I don't know.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** I'm going to give him credit.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** Yes, he is a producer.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:46]** So I'm not going to argue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** Question.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** This is a bad remix.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** Question.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** Unrelated to music.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Can we all agree?

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:53]** No.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:53]** For once.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:54]** No.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:54]** Never.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:57]** Is that your question?

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** For once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** That was it.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** Did DJ Khaled is a dweeb?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:06]** No, that putting ranch on pizza is not... It's disgusting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Yeah, I agree.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** Who doesn't agree with that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:13]** This doesn't need to be a long, drawn-out, classic, we'll-say thing about food.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** I don't know any...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:39]** no i don't put ranch on pizza thank you i actually have to eat crow on this one because before we started recording i did you put ranch i have a very good friend who was like it's actually really good and she's kind of from the midwest so like they do that there and so i was like all right i guess i'll try it like i'll give it a shot hidden valley is it's good it's actually it's good

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** It's not terrible.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** It's good.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:44]** It's also good, not just on pizza.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:46]** It's good on pizza rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:51]** I almost see an argument for dipping my crust in ranch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:56]** I don't like ranch to begin with, but that's what I was thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:56 - 00:07:02]** I would always prefer a garlic butter sauce from Papa John's or something like that.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:04]** That's a totally different thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:07]** I actually really don't like that sauce now that I say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** I don't like theirs.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** I like other places.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:16]** Right, I like real garlic butter sauce, but theirs is just like... Theirs is like a congealed gel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:19]** There goes our censorship from Papa John's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:21]** I used to love it, and I had it the other day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:21]** You know what?

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:23]** I will shit on Papa John's all day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:26]** Domino's, baby!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** As a former Domino's employee...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:33]** See, man, Will and I just can't stop disagreeing today.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:35]** I f*** with Papa John's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:38]** I tried to f*** with them the other week because I was like, I haven't had them in so long.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** I love their breadsticks.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:39]** I love their garlic sauce.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** And I've been a Domino's fan for the past few years.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:45]** And dude, I had it and I was like, this is actual cardboard.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** And I know people say Domino's is cardboard.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:47]** It's not.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** But Papa John's, bad, dude.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:49]** Bad.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** I'm so sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** I think we've had this discussion a million times.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:55]** Domino's is not good pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** It's better than Little Caesars.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** It's great pizza.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:58]** Right.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:01]** My six-year-old could make better than Little Caesars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:05]** Little Caesars, though, there's something about cheesy.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:09]** It's like being able to roll in and get like a $5 large or whatever.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** It's kind of nice.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** You don't have to wait for it.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** That's the thing.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:15]** It serves a purpose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** What about Costco?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:17]** Dude, whoa.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** Costco pizza.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:22]** I think it's slightly overrated, but I think it's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** When you can find a place.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** How fast can you tell me how this chat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** It's just a soggy fucking pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:32]** Listen, when I want to get, you know, a lift for my car.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:37]** I actually do, and I don't do anything with it.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** I'm like, why do I have this fucking thing?

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** Sorry.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:39]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:41]** I'm just saying.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** I don't wash or dry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** Yeah, I don't wash or dry.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** Like anything that I can throw.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:49]** And then, of course, I'm hungry from all this shopping.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** So this is the cheat code.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:52]** You ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:56]** You go to the food court and then you go around.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:56]** Yeah.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:57]** That's the cheat code.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:58]** I know.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** You go to the food court.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** You get your glizzy.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:02]** You get your pizza.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:04]** You get your ice cream, coffee thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** The chicken bake.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:06]** You take it in with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:08]** I've never had the chicken bake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** Dude, the chicken bake is pretty good.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** It's good.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** No, it's not.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** Then it's the glizzy in the chicken bake.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:20]** Listen, the chicken bake is effectively a Alfredo calzone.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:22]** Yeah, it's an Alfredo calzone.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** So then you have an Alfredo


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:49]** hot dog it's dude it's good it's good so okay ranch on pizza is out of pocket but an alfredo hot dog isn't correct i feel like it's also weird i would put anything on hot dog that's probably what i'm saying i mean sorry there's some great hot dog variations i wanted to circle back to this ranch on pizza is not just the crust is like dipping your crust in pizza sauce and then in ranch


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:57]** You sure it's not like dipping your crust in ranch and then rolling around in the dirt and then taking a bite of it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:02]** And you drop it accidentally on the sidewalk and then you pick it up and then you dip it in the ocean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:04]** And that's how they figured out their rosemary was tasty.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:09]** They just dropped it on a bush, picked it up, and was like, oh man, this is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** Rosemary is tasty, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:14]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** Please don't fact check me because I just made that up.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** I apologize for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** I do know somebody who has a soap gene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** Cilantro is tough.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** I hope it's not Ariel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:22]** No, it's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:25]** And if it is that you'll tell me, cause I cook with a lot of cilantro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:27]** No, I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:27]** Yeah.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** We're not super.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** Everything that Vinny cooks is soapy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:33]** Yeah.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** I don't, I don't use olive oil.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** I use Mrs. Myers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** That's it.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:41]** It helps protect the nonstick coating.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:44]** And also like, I don't, everything just slides right off.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:48]** I don't even have to wash the dish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:57]** Look, I want to play, but to do so, we got to recap.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:01]** And when we recap, we're talking about a big thing that happened.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:03]** You have to recapitulate.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** Yeah.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** And we got to just acknowledge that there's been some.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** No, that's not really.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:10]** What else would it mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** But what am I capitulating to?

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:15]** Next, you're going to be surprised that facts stands for facsimile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** Oh, no, it does mean that, actually.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** Recapitulate, yeah.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:19]** Now that I think about it.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:20]** Wow.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:26]** Because recapitulating is restating what you... Well, no, no, that is what it means, though.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:29]** A summary of what has been a recapitulation.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** I don't know why I didn't think about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:39]** As Will and I sit here with smug smiles on our faces because we have that in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:42]** So to be clear, recapitulate is to summarize.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:46]** To capitulate is to cease to resist an opponent or unwelcome demand.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** To surrender.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:51]** So what are you ceasing again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:55]** Who are you ceasing again to?

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:58]** I can say this because like...

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:07]** In the thing that I do on the side, because we use slightly older English, when we recapitulate someone, they go through it again.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** They actually go through it.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** It's not just telling them.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:11]** You actually lead them through the process again.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:15]** So you are surrendering yourself when you're recapitulating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** Classically, anyway.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:22]** So if we recapitulate, then are we surrendering ourselves?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:22]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** You're being re-journeyed through.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:27]** You're putting us through what we don't want to do, by the way.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** Can you re-serve that for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:53]** can i blow your minds one more time to reneg is to renegotiate that one's easy yeah i already know one many thanks yeah yeah sorry it's cheap look i want to play let's recapitulate this process i want to play and then i want to recapitulate our recapitulation means what you think it means

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:55]** Look, I'm alley-ooping all over the place, okay?

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:57]** And then it's really important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:00]** You almost had me on that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:11]** To acknowledge that as of today, recently, there's been some discord in the Discord about what happened.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** It's pretty wild.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Pretty wild.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:16]** Some commotion in the Wolvesave ocean.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:16]** Is that how you said, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:17]** Yes.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:18]** Yeah.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:20]** The Discord.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** There was a long thread that I still haven't gone through all of it yet.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:41]** I look forward to responding to your hate mail thank you everyone it's a good read if you also want to partake in the tomfoolery and discord join our discord at discord.willsavethepodcast.com


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:41 - 00:14:09]** complaints go to we don't care at willsaythepodcast.com but if you want to interact then like it's but there were other people at ocean.willsaythepodcast.com that's it these aren't complaints or hate mail in this at all it's actually just a good discussion on different viewpoints I mean I do want hate mail and then find her and be like nah you guys should just give in yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:25]** they were talking about our interviews with Nodens and other people were like yeah this is sus this is sus and whatever so tell us John tell us about how sus are I have one quick question before we get into how sus these people are


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:29]** So, like, just a, like, business thing.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:35]** As a cast member, as a player, are we supposed to, like, read the spoilers in that channel, or do we need to not read the spoilers in that channel?

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:38]** That's always really ambiguous to me, and I don't know.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:39]** It's okay for us.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** Right, because they're, like, separate channels.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** The spoilers are for other people.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Spoilers are, like, for us.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** That's what I thought happened in the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:48]** That's what I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:52]** There was that one time in general where we talked about it.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:56]** The spoilers were about, and they were like, don't read these spoilers.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** And then they continue to talk shit.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** behind the spoiler window.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:08]** And then they f***ing keep trolling me with the spoiler windows, and I don't know when to not... Will's bored.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:12]** He's going to start doing... Every time he responds, he's going to be behind the spoiler window.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:15]** Will's going to have, like, three fake accounts.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** I hear all they do.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:19]** Who do you think's in the Discord?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:23]** It's been Will this whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:25]** Will is all three of our coffee subscribers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:30]** When I go into, like, the master Discord account.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:33]** Thank you to our actual real coffee subscribers.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** You all are fantastic.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** You are not fake.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:37]** You're the real deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:40]** We had a couple more additions lately, too.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** So we want to thank you.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:44]** I think it was... Oh, my God.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:46]** It was Grumpus, and then who else joined recently?

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** There were two.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:50]** Anyway, thanks for joining that episode.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:52]** Good job, Kelly.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** Sold it.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:56]** Sorry, was it Jimmy?

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:56]** Who was it?

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** Someone else joined.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:59]** I apologize for forgetting.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:03]** Just know that I'm not April O'Neil.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** We really do feel supported by you.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:11]** And also, when I go into the Master Will Save Discord account, I have access to all the channels, right?

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:15]** That includes the things that John hides, like the three FCs.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** And that has, like, spoilers there.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** But I purposely, I avoid.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:20]** Thank you.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:22]** I hate going into that, like, email.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:27]** I only do it when I have to do, like, stuff that's, like, otherwise unfeasible for the Discord.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:34]** And, like, I just, I never click on it, but I do see that there's a lot written in there between you and all these other three FCG guys.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:34]** There is a lot.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:36]** Crotea!

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:38]** A lot of OMGs and LOLs and so on.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:39]** Thank you, Crotea.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:41]** I've never clicked on it, but I've never clicked on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:43]** Kelly, thank you so much for that.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:43]** Oh, Crotea.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:45]** Yeah, sorry, just want to shout out Crotea.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:47]** Thank you for not doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:51]** I kind of like crow, but crow tea I think is correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** How the hell would you pronounce your thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** Speaking of coffee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** Tell us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:56]** Tell us.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:03]** Speaking of coffee, we got a subscriber sentence that we got to get out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:06]** Are you going to DM us on the download and we have to use it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:08]** Going to go by, got a D4?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:15]** I love that we bring this back occasionally instead of just the banter topics where I have to give personal identifiable information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:42]** someone asked about this if we were still doing it and i said yep and frankly i i just tried to space it out now that we have banter as well i try and space it out because we don't have so many yet uh so i try and space it out that way there's one uh you know subscriber piece of influence or you know idea that comes through every maybe in time we can do both yeah in the meantime who just fell again

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** One, two, three, four.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:47]** I'm going to roll this D4.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Let's see who's going to get it.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:51]** Okay.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** All righty.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** I am now going.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** And who is it from?

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:57]** It is from, well, should I say now?

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** Say who it is from.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** No, say it when you do it.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:02]** Yeah, no, no, no.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:05]** We say it when we do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** Yeah.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:06]** Okay.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:06]** Why?

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** Why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:10]** Because it's a surprise.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:10]** Surprise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** To the rest of us.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:15]** I have messaged that individual.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** I'm not looking at my messages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:18]** Good luck with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:26]** He's like, okay, so I picked another person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:26]** Yeah, alright.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** Amazing.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:27]** Amazing.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:30]** Alright, let's recapitulate the story here.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** Let's go through and see what happened.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:40]** Last time we ended after... In the aftermath of these interviews, Rick19 said...

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** I'm going to be a little sneaky sneak.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:50]** And instead of turning left to walk out of the restricted area, I'm going to turn right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:50]** Hold on.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:51]** Sorry.

**[00:18:51 - 00:19:02]** So just imagine Rick, like, you know, like how some people just try to escape just cause, but he's like over the top and he's just like snapping everyone's neck as he's just like, cause.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:04]** He's just a murderous android.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** He's like, I had to do it.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:06]** I had to.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** Cutting out the vocal cords.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:13]** He had the rumblies in his tummies that only hand could satisfy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:16]** I really enjoyed not being called a murder bot for 12 weeks.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:19]** We only made two or three jokes about it so far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:22]** I was going to say, we did not make it 12 weeks without calling you a murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** Yeah, there's no way.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** There's no way that that happened.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:30]** I mean, maybe not to your face, but we definitely...

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** We definitely talked about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:51]** So Rick 19 decides to explore, peek around the hallway, and in doing so, discovers that there is a decent bit more to this place, including two sets of double doors in this long hallway.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:57]** And down the hallway, he sees Shay and talking with someone.

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:02]** As he walks up closer, Bernice is like, I'm going to watch your back.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** Make sure that you're cool.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:08]** I get the nod of approval from Will that I read Bernice correctly.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:22]** And as Rick was about to go into one of the rooms and said, you know what, maybe I'll just do a little eavesdrop, just get a little further, presents himself to Shay and this other steward.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:32]** sees that there is another hallway, two other hallways, another door, and some sort of like command center area, right?

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:37]** With a door and glass windows, can see somebody behind the monitors.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:42]** As you're walking up, you think that you hear them talking in a language.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:45]** You're like, Shay was talking to a Patra.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:53]** Maybe it was like Patra language, which I want to say is Patris, which would be kind of a cool name for a language.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:53]** I don't know.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** Patrian.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:54]** Patrian.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** Walking up.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:59]** And then they're like, oh, hey, what are you doing?

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** What are you doing?

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:02]** Start to escort you out.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:05]** An individual comes out of that security station.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:13]** It's the Vlaka, Officer Astara, pounding, trying to get your attention, and pointing, saying that you need to get the f*** out.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:19]** they escort you out, and it's at that time, as you're walking down the hall, they curse, even though, yeah.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** And then... In sign language, they use their middle finger.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:27]** The doctor opened the door behind... That was a bad joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:32]** No, I just, I like the idea of, like, dog people doing that, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:35]** It's f***ing great.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** It's good.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:43]** The door opens... The door opens on Bernice, and before Dr. Nodens can...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:43 - 00:22:11]** get too close oh what are you still doing here rick comes around the corner helps bernice and you leave you get out and then you all four meet up and you decide to have a really in-depth conversation in front of sylvania the steward out in public okay but like in my defense everyone must have known about that fucking multiplier thing oh

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:12]** It's cool.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** I feel like it's fine.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:19]** Then you dig in, or you dip off into the briefing room.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:21]** Start to have, check for bugs.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:23]** Start to have some more conversations.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** And Colin's like, hey, don't forget.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:30]** Actually, I think Kaniko was just confiding in me about some suspicions that she had.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** Or that they had.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** Oh, Kaniko.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:34]** Kaniko Breeze.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:37]** Second in command to the Pyke Spiritans.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:40]** Possible future girlfriend of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** In Colin's mind.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** I'll ship it.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** Okay.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:45]** Not yet.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** It's a little early for that.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:47]** I mean.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** We don't know if she's evil or not.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** At some point, we'll get shipped.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:54]** We'll write a fan fiction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:54 - 00:23:00]** Let's do a quick recap on some of the clues slash like things of interest, let's call them.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:01]** I don't know.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** That have come up in the past few.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:10]** A couple of episodes, namely in the past one to two.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** A couple of things, right?

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:21]** One of them, Rick19, you saw that there's some files on one of the data pads in the medical center.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:32]** You saw that there was a file that showed that some patient had been transported from Tier Calis Base to Terrapin Station.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:37]** You asked Dr. Nones about it.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:40]** They said that there was a, that therapy station is a communications array.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:45]** And then when you asked Kaniko, Kaniko said much the same.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** That it's a communication station.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** Things are funneled there.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** Again, it's a secret facility.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** Keeping things tight.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:56]** Then, Colin, there was Kaniko's

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:23]** questions musings worries about officer astara davlaka saying that they don't usually come out to greet new guests they smelled like incense which you all remembered is an iomadean would that be kind of a right yeah but like is a right of yomadai

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** I don't know if that's how you say it.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:26]** Eomidian?

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:27]** Eomidian.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:27]** That's cool.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** It's a Eomidian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** I think Will's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:32]** Really?

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** I mean, it's Eomidai.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** Eomidian?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:40]** I don't know how... I've heard several pronunciations about how you're supposed to say Eomidai.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:41]** Yeah.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** I'm with Will.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** Eomidian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:43]** Yeah.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:46]** So it's a Eomidian rite.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:50]** You would remember from being in any shrines or temples to Eomidai.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:57]** Then also, they were saying that Vlachas are born blind or deaf.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** Officer Astara is deaf.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** Two-thirds.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** Sorry, two-thirds.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** You're right.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** I don't want to generalize.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** I thought it was three-quarters.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:10]** No, it was two-thirds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** I thought it was five-eighths.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:14]** John's like, I just want to get through this fucking recap.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:17]** Sorry, we're not submitting ourselves to recapitulation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:19]** I am recapitulating to you all.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** I don't think I used that right.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:28]** The important thing here is that it seemed like they were... Maybe they heard something?

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:30]** They seemed to turn around and react in a way.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:33]** Maybe that's nothing.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:36]** Maybe they're not... They're hearing impaired.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** It's not necessarily the case, right?

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** It just seemed odd.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** All these things just seemed a little odd.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** Another thing.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:47]** During the questions, there were two things.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** There were two questions there.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** Well, there were a lot of questions there.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:58]** There were two questions there that were a little like, well, one was that I think they asked, who did they ask?

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:03]** They asked Hears about... If he killed Nico.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:12]** No, they asked Hears what he thought about Rick's time on the computer.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:21]** And then Colin, Dr. Nodens in your first interview said, do you have any secrets?

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Kind of jokingly.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:24]** And you said, I'll share if you do.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:28]** And then in her next interview, she shared a secret with it.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:32]** She said, where is it?

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:38]** She said, shit, I can't find it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** I don't remember her saying that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** Yeah, she did not say ba-ba-ba.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:43]** Ba-ba-ba-ba.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:46]** Oh, no way.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** Don't do it.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:50]** Don't do the next notes.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:52]** Don't you do those next notes.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** Oh, are we going to get sued?

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** Here it is.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** Okay, sorry, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** But I'm loving it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:57]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** She said Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:00]** That got Will.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:03]** Colin, you're not alone.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:09]** I've decided to take you up on your offer, and I will share a secret with you.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:16]** Someone on the Peritons knows what your family really does.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** None of that made it into the next.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** I haven't asked.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:22]** She said, I haven't asked what that is.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** Out of courtesy, out of the depths of her heart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:28]** I really need to stop drinking when we record.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:56]** that was a quick i mean i'm gonna have to re-listen right me too there's a lot in there i will say there i i put down a lot of questions i don't remember which episode that was also it was 107 all right kaniko then also brought up she said have you like she was like have you checked the room this room

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:01]** And she was like, I encourage you to check every space that you're in.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:06]** And she also said, she mentioned something about how she doesn't trust Orvir.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:11]** She met up with Orvir before this mission, but didn't meet up with him here.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:13]** She met up with him, like, as they were en route, you know?

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:17]** And she said, ever since then, maybe it's been fine.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:22]** But as of late, really, things have been, like, it's been a slow cascade of, like,

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Things just seem off.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** Orvier just seems different.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:32]** And she mentioned looking into Orvier's computer, which I think it was Dr. O'Keefe.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:37]** You were in the... Let me bring you guys back to your call space on Foundry.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:40]** Thank you, Foundry and all cool modules.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** You were in the guest office, I believe, Dr. O'Keefe?

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:48]** You were in that room right off of the restricted access door.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:51]** I think Colin was next to you in the brief room that you're in now.

**[00:28:53 - 00:29:02]** You would remember both when you were in there and just having known that office is where Orvir is meant to do some work.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** That's where he's going to go.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:07]** So she is like, I don't trust Orvir.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:13]** That's a sensible place to maybe see if there's anything going on, right?

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:21]** And then she says, look, all of these amount on their own to isolated incidents that make me a little suspicious, make me feel a little weird.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:28]** I thought I would talk to Colin about it and ask and just see, just know.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:35]** But the thing that really pushed her over the edge of saying we need to collect some some clues here.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:40]** We need to get a little more information and maybe consider an escape plan or something.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:54]** Is this quantum replicator synthesizer that she says she saw by the seashore with seashells at Outpost Omicron.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:56]** And...

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:00]** At the time, she's like, I don't know what that is.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:01]** We need to go.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:04]** And Shay's like, yeah, I don't know what that is.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** I'm definitely not going to take it.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:17]** And then shows Hears, because Hears' birthday is coming up, shows Hears as kind of a gift and clearly took the replicator from some sort of, you know, from a gray site.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:23]** It's some sort of gray machine that replicates whatever you put into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:47]** here's only saw a rock sorry what kelly oh i was gonna say we had our own we would do this like i feel like that's something we would do as well so i can't blame you like taking taking some technology and implementing it yeah yes and i mean here's is a pirate that's true that's very on brand for here's and she put it up in the corner


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:47 - 00:31:14]** of the reactor room kind of out of sight a little out of mind with that i don't want to take up two more time too much more time because i feel like i those this is a long recapitulation let's get capitulation yeah it was let's get back into it so with that in mind she has just told you that she's like this is i don't even know this is this is interesting i'm worried uh

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:20]** I feel like something's coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:24]** Koniko, who is on board the Pike's ship currently?

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** Who is on board the Pike's ship currently?

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:27]** It's not stealing if you let us take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:31]** Well, honestly, I would need to be on it.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** You know we have experience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** Huh?

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:38]** Well, I need to be on it, and so does the Pike's Paratons crew.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** We would never want to go without you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:40]** Guys.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Does it belong to Orvier?

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** Because you said Orvier is suspect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:51]** Orvier is definitely... So it is stealing, if we take that ship.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** It's registered to Orvier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:54 - 00:32:02]** I thought we already had a plan to wait until the festivities are at their height and investigate a bit more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:05]** Yeah, we were talking about that's tomorrow night.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** That's Inspector Heard's pledge day.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:09]** There's still... Or tomorrow afternoon, whatever.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:17]** And then there's still time tonight where I think it might be useful to just collect more facts.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:20]** Okay, we're talking about...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:26]** Escaping and we're accusing a steward's base that I have had experience with.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:37]** I know that you all haven't, and you've had some rather terrifying experiences with Dr. Nodens, who truthfully I haven't experienced too much, where they're bringing up your trauma.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:38]** Horrible.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:44]** But we're still talking about going against an entire steward's base, or at least trying to escape one.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** This is not trivial.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Rick, you've had your hand raised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:49]** No, this is Kevin.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** This is a metagame.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** Kevin.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:52]** Hertz.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** Where is Hertz?

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:56]** Inspector Hertz is a new inspector?

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** No, you said Inspector Hertz.

**[00:32:59 - 00:32:59]** Sorry, Herd.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** H-I-R-D.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:01]** Herd.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** Okay, Herd.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:05]** It's Inspector... I'm just trying to figure out the hierarchy.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:08]** The Vlaka is the highest...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:25]** officer heard is above them yes officer star the block has always been the second in command to inspector okay then and her herds pledge day that's coming up it's herds pledge day that's coming up tomorrow and it's their 12th pledge day


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:54]** yeah okay and you would know too that like in in general the hierarchy in case you're not aware inspector heard right chief chief inspector heard officer astara then technically shay and narla are constables right they're technically constables but they they're senior right so they're closer to officer astara they're just not limited to this base in particular right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** And then below that are constables.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:58]** Have you seen Inspector Heard recently?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** No, not really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:02]** Inspector Heard is... Have you ever seen Inspector Heard?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:06]** Yes, we saw Inspector Hurd.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** I don't recall Inspector Hurd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:13]** Okay, so when you landed, Inspector Hurd and Officer Astara came out to greet you.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:22]** And they welcomed you in a very serious manner that was just kind of like a, I see that Shay and Narla have brought you here.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** And welcome.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** These are the rules.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** You should follow them.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:31]** You'll be out of here soon.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** That was it.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:39]** They're a no-nonsense, tight ship, tight base individual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:45]** Excuse me, the rest of the crew.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** I was thinking back to that story you told me in the bar.

**[00:34:50 - 00:35:05]** You know, if we were to divide this up maybe between, you know, a couple of books, is it possible we've got those star-shaped things, starfish-shaped things replacing senior officers here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** The astrozoans?


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:11]** Yeah, that's... Astrozoans?

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:16]** Some of the crew were Astrozoans, right?

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** On the Chimera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** I can't remember.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** I sort of remember you saying that.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** Somewhat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** There were three Astrozoans on the Chimera.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:28]** One of them took the body of the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Yes, I remember now.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:41]** The three of you were doing a sort of dramatic reenactment of your experiences since being on the Chimera when we were on the Void Crier.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:44]** Yeah, you were doing like a whole play that you had worked out.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:44]** There were songs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:51]** It was puppet theater with shadow puppets and marionettes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:56]** It was really a blend of mediums.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:04]** We hosted it in the second cargo bay.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:10]** The whole ship showed up at the second cargo bay for our Kabuki theater.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:14]** We've got to do Act 2 for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:24]** Do you think that maybe if we did a diversion, you could do act two somewhere in this space?

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** Okay, good.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:26]** Okay, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** He just straightens his collars.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:31]** Definitely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** You're an acting troupe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:35]** You're thespians.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** I checked the notes.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:38]** I did actually take notes on this at one point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:42]** I was about to say, did you take notes on this meeting with Herd?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:48]** Inspector Herd is a... Oh, man.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** Now I forgot what it is.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:51]** It's what... What?

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** I'm so dumb.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:53]** You're not dumb.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** My brain's hurting my head.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:58]** You're not dumb.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:00]** It starts with a V. What's the word?

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** Frithani?

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** That's the word.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:02]** Frithani.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Yep, yep, yep.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** I got it.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Fel.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:07]** Fel on STF is a Frithani.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Yes.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** That's the other famous Frithani.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:14]** Just if you don't know, they're extra long...

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:42]** human humanoid creatures they're like they they lived in the diaspora and so they're they like on what was that that show the expanse the expanse belt similar to that and they have from the belt but their skin can also change colors right yeah and their and their eyes are all black that's cool i want to be one of those i mean i want to get very cool first but sounds like a fun way yeah we should ask uh yeah

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:46]** So, and just to note, she also had power armor, so that's a little scary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** He did, yes.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** He knows what we should.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** He had super intense power armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:58]** If we let Leslie to, like, EM something, kind of like what we did back when, then they can shoot us down for every race we want.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:01]** That's what we need.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:01]** That's what we need.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** Like, nah, you're all humans.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:05]** No blockers.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** No blockers.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** Oh, so close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:09]** All right, so, look, I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Hey, Leslie.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Leslie, you're fantastic.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Thank you for being awesome, as always.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:20]** All right, look, I think we need to take some action.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Who are you suggesting?

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** Well, there are a couple things here.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:40]** I think I'm going to talk to some of the other Paragents, see if I can see if they've noticed anything, clue them in to maybe that we need to get out of here quickly and they need to be ready.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:46]** Is there anything that you all can do, either checking out the guest office or...

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** I don't know.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:52]** Should we try and get back behind in the restricted area?

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:54]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:55 - 00:39:03]** Getting in the restricted area might serve our immediate goals more readily, I would imagine, but...

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:11]** If I were to, you know, hide some terrible truth, I'm sure I would keep it behind a locked door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:19]** We need to keep... I agree with Dr. Okay, and we need to... We need to be able to make a quick escape, though.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** Right.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:23]** So, Koniko, can we use your ship if things go south?

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:24]** You know what I mean?

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:27]** While we're trying to gather intel.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:29]** Because if they find out...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:50]** could be in trouble especially if we if they are who think they are not well i rolled a six for my sense motive and i i'm gonna say that i'm already suspicious of koniko and leaning towards the stewards at this point i i don't disagree uh it is a little sus 17


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** I rolled a 20 dirty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:56]** I think you all did this last time, and she seems just as genuine.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** Yeah, she seems pretty genuine.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:01]** She is somebody... You can tell that she's a little flummoxed.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** She's somebody who takes action.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** This is a tough moment.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:09]** She's talking about leaving her... Like, not her crew, but she's leaving Orvir and the stewards.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:15]** Her job, her livelihood, which she's known, and escaping from a steward's base.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:18]** That means things have gotten...

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:39]** pretty bad the other thing is you recall especially you here is that you know after talking with shay and narla like you've built up a bit of goodwill with them so there's a like in the same way that rick was like oh sorry and shay was like whoa you're not supposed to be here officer star was like what the are you doing here and the patra was surprised shay was like

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:43]** I'm going to let... Let's let Rick pass this one time.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:47]** Rick is probably trying to explore, but guys, it's fine.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** Don't worry.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:53]** All of that to say that a quick escape might be necessary.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:57]** You might have a little bit of leeway depending on what you're doing.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:02]** If you're going to try and go plant some bombs and run out, then yeah, that might not be good.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:08]** But if you're just trying to get some information to confirm, which is what Kaniko is suggesting...

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:11]** then that might be a little bit easier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:20]** John's giving us the go-ahead to do espionage with limited consequences, potentially, which is quite good.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** That's what he's saying, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** I'm not necessarily saying that.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:25]** Shay's the third in charge, and he's on our side.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:27]** But no, I was trying to think back.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:30]** So technically, the Pykes, do they have a ship here?

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:34]** Because the ship that they were on was the Void Cryer, and the Void Cryer is a stewardship that the Pykes were riding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:34 - 00:42:03]** right so the shay was on that yeah you can see it if you were to go to the the yeah the hangar the other hangar there's a there's a there's a wing at the other side of the hangar the entire hangar is just just not shown yeah so the the big one that we can see is the voyeur okay yeah the big one that you can see in the gray area that's the boy crying you can see up a little bit because of the fog of war you can see that there's the corner of the pikes peritons ship right i see that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:12]** And Shay has always been kind of, like, fumbly.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** Is that the right word for it?

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:17]** He's a little on the goofy side when it comes to who we've been dealing with.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:23]** And so, like, his response to Rick in that hallway is aligned to that.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:30]** So, like, I'm just trying to... The idea you brought up the Astrozoans and, like, the Vlaka is sus now.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:55]** dr nodens is sus shay is only sus because of the gray technology he stole but he could just be an idiot he just dj khalid what is it hanlon's razor the equipment that's what that's what he should have said when he was like come on just put it in man another one

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** He is.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** He is.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** He is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:05]** And what perhaps is this?

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:07]** I actually DJ on the set.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:09]** Look, this is Canico.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:11]** Will, go ahead.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:16]** How effective could I do like some sort of knowledge check?

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:19]** I still have a Mark II pheromone grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:22]** Ooh, tell us, pray tell, what that does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** I don't know, actually.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:25]** I can't find the text for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** I don't know.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** Yoink.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:30]** Toss.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:30]** Hey, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:34]** Do you mind if I just shoot this grenade off real quick?

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** Mark II pheromone grenade.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:38]** No, but doesn't that change the attitude of people?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** Let's find out.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:43]** It deals no damage, instead dispersing a powerful cocktail.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:45]** Ooh, cocktails.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:46]** Cheers.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** Yeah.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:49]** I have wine, so that's fine.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** Magically modified mind-altering chemicals.

**[00:43:52 - 00:44:00]** Each creature in the radius that inhales the pheromones, which bypass even environmental protections, must attempt a saving throw.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:06]** A creature that fails is fascinated for a number of rounds.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** Fascinating.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:12]** That's how we found Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** We got fascinated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:14]** That's true.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:15]** It's true.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:15]** We did.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** Look, I have an idea.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:24]** Does anyone, maybe just one person, want to come with me and go see what we can find on Orvir's computer?

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:28]** I'm just thinking of actions I'm taking right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:30]** I'm happy to go with Bernice.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:33]** But we should all go together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:40]** I, at this point, feel like I need to return to my room and possibly don my armor.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:42]** That might be a good idea.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:44]** Is that a smart idea?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:51]** But I would just be maybe wary about walking around with it, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** With my armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:55]** Well, I mean, you don't want to cause suspicion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:59]** You guys are all wearing your armor still, too, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:59 - 00:44:59]** I'm the only one that took it off.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** You're the only one who took it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:02]** Maybe.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:03]** Hear me out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** I guess you could make an excuse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:11]** I can say that you're about to rehearse, dress rehearsal, for the performance tomorrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:14]** And you're walking around.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** Act two.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:18]** Yeah, that's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:24]** Excuse me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** Yeah.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:33]** Under here's his armor is like, uh, these sort of like traditional, like Japanese, like, uh, Kimono sort of robes.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:35]** And they slowly like dropped out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** Yeah.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** Yeah.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** I'm ready.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** All right.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:43]** So who would like to go with me to check out the computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** Well, computers are my specialty.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** I should go with you.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:52]** But I really do think that we should wait for Rick and let him get his armor.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:55]** It'll only take a couple seconds, and we should go together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:59]** I think you should take Bernice with you to help assist in any... Sure.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:04]** She's got some tricks up her sleeve, if you know what I mean.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:34]** sure he does have four arms and everything if he put wood here he's got he's only got two we talked he's got two arms he has two arms and he's got the little the little one that's what I mean yeah I know you can't hold these things they're only for meeting speak for yourself you don't know that you don't know him I know I know more from Starfinder all right every every individual is different all right look Koneko's like are we going very deft


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** We're going.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:39]** Would Bernice be able to just chill on here as his back?

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** I think you just carry him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** She's a suitcase.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** I kind of want that to happen.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** She's made of nanites.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:48]** She could sprout shoulder straps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:51]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:56]** It'll be like one of those 80s nylon straps.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Like a crossbody?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:00]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** Or is she a fanny pack?

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** But like a suitcase-sized fanny pack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:31]** yeah right that would be great here's drops down to like one knee and then like uh and then he's like come on bernice i guess bernice like hops on his back i'll uh i'll be piloting her from my room but i'm gonna search it for bugs first okay wait so are we splitting up is that what's happening is it really splitting up if we all go to the rooms and rick's gonna start walking out and head towards like am i stuck okay i'm stuck


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** How do I get out of here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:36]** You have to open... I guess I'll go with... The door opens like this.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Yeah.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** I'm sorry.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:41]** All I can hear is take on me after that discussion of fanny packs.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:42]** Classic.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:44]** Man, fanny packs are back now, and it's kind of weird.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:45]** They're great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:51]** I have to step through the hallway, and he turns to Sylvania.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:51 - 00:48:16]** and kind of just looks at her funny like awkwardly like he's trying not to make eye contact but he's trying he's just like noticing that she's still there she's still doing her crosswords so she doesn't look at you here's comes up next to konigo and he's like well i guess we're doing this i'm all right where's bernice going where's the door i don't know where i'm at i'm so i was pretending like i was lost last time and now i'm actually lost dude here's i get one more it's one more down


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:23]** Bernice is I'll navigate Bernice from the room.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:25]** But but first, let's let's take a look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:25]** All right.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:28]** So Rick is going to step into his room and he's going to shut the door behind him.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:33]** And he's going to turn on the computer as he starts pulling his armor out onto the bed.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:37]** And he's going to let it boot up as he's putting on his gear.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** And like he's just pausing.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:42]** And every time he sees a computer, you know, he logs into it.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:50]** And he finally gets all his armor on, and he's going to real quickly, not even sitting down, log on to the internet for the computer.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** And do you need me to do a computer's check?

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** No.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:59]** He's going to attempt to log back into the android abolitionist front.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:00]** Okay.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:00]** site.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:08]** And if that doesn't work, he's going to check a second site to make sure the internet's functioning.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:11]** So he's going to do like, yeah, it's going to be Yahoo.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:14]** Yahoo.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** Yeah.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** Okay.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** That wasn't very good.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** What's my computers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** 13 computers.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:29]** I mean, you're able to type in the Android abolitionist front interface and you don't see anything come up.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** The same one that you tried before.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** And then I do a speed test on that.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:34]** The speed is limited.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:42]** I think it tracks with your understanding that all communication here is being funneled.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:44]** Being like really tightly controlled.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:45]** Right.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:48]** It's not like you just have tons of speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:50]** Okay.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:54]** Last thing he's going to do is go to AAF.com.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:56]** AAF.com.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:58]** Like their public website.

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:03]** Do the Android's abolitionist front have a public website?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** Are they anonymous?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** I don't think they do.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** I don't think that they do, truthfully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:11]** They would have something that's, like, accessible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** I don't think they do.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** I'm happy to change it if you really feel that way.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** Here's why.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:29]** It's because it is assumed that the leader of the AAF, right, because the, like, the pact world's pact, like, the people who, like, are the, you know, are the leaders as representatives, right?

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:33]** It is assumed, my understanding, is that one of them


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:53]** is the leader of the android applications front and it's kind of like a clandestine role right what what all i'm trying to do is figure out whether or not it is like if it's being filtered if it's not if it doesn't exist at all or if it's just the internet slow like it's one of those three things


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:55]** Oh, so you're going to a known site.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** So just use a Tor router.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** Come on.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** Yeah, use a VPN or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:03]** Can he help set that up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** Well, he's doing this privately in the room without anybody.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Yeah, I know, but we could help you.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:13]** You go on AAF.com and you get the Absalom Arborist Federation.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** Those are fine.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:15]** No problem.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** It's a real sign.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:19]** It's a bunch of trees on Absalom Station.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** They have an event next Tuesday.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** They do.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:21]** Yep.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:25]** And they have a fundraiser coming up that if you get in now.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:56 - 00:52:00]** I would say go ahead and give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:04]** 19 on the die for a 31.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:08]** 19 on the die for a 31.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** Okay.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:12]** Rick 19.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:17]** So Dr. K, you're in the room and you're planning on controlling Bernice from the room, right?

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** Okay, cool.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:23]** So, and Rick, you left because you're going to go in range.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:24]** Yeah.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:29]** Cause you're going to go follow, uh, Kaniko and Colin.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:32]** Okay, cool.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:34]** As we'll, we'll come back to you in just a second.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Well, as Kaniko left,

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:46]** walks around the corner, nods at Sylvania, who, again, is just looking at their crossword, and then doesn't even look up, and she walks into the guest's office.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** Do the three of you follow behind?

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** The four of you?

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** Bernice, Kears, Colin?

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** You said Sylvania or Cody?

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** Cody.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:56]** Kaniko walks into the guest office.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:56]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Here's his following.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:59]** Colin follows immediately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:01]** Where are you guys at?

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** I'm lost.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** I see Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** Don't say anything.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:09]** Just let him figure it out as if he was really confused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** Okay, so which one is it?

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** Okay, there's Sylvania, and he's going to look at her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** I thought we were breaking in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:15]** Yeah, we are.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:16]** It's not locked.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** You're hacking into the computer.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Oh, I could have been in here for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:27]** Here's going to help with... Well, you're looking throughout the room, Dr. Okay, which makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:31]** I'm with you with whatever you need.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:31]** I'll help you.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** I'll help you out with it.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:32]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:33]** Thanks, Pierce.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:37]** And then the door shuts at RIC-19 as he's about to walk in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:40]** No, Rick will stay outside.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:44]** He's just going to look over her shoulder, over Sylvania's shoulder at her phone.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:51]** And every once in a while whisper, 28 down is Mississippi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:56]** Can you roll like an infuriation check?

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** All right.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** So you're keeping point.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:06]** You're just watching to see how things are going.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** Roll me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:11]** Sorry, is there somebody in the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:14]** You would recognize Red.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** Red.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** The gnoll, Kelly.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** Not as cool as the Vlaka, but still cool.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** You seem to like gnolls.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** You've never seen one before.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:28]** It's a 10 total.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** It's a 10 total.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** Bernice got a 17.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** Bernice is unfortunately in the other room.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:56]** and it's the and it's the room across the way oh yeah she's with us you don't notice anything uh eric 19 at the moment except for the crosswords let's jump back into the guest office kaniko's like okay so uh i am skilled at leading that's that's where my talent lies i'm not skilled at computers uh colin i'm skilled at those bernice

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:59]** I don't think leader is a skill set.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** I don't see it on my list of skills.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** That's rude.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:03]** It's just unnecessary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** Just no need to say that.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:09]** Just no need to question somebody like that.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:13]** She has... Dude, her diplomacy...

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** Plus 15.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:14]** Wow.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** Culture, plus 10.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** That's incredible.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:19]** Which is not that great.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:21]** But good sense motive, good stealth.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** Yeah, she's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:30]** I've worked with a computer to my day, but I should let these guys have a chance to mess with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:37]** Bernice does a little twirl and is like, help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:39]** Like, help.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:43]** Bernice, why don't you help out with this computer right now?

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:49]** By the way, Kuniko, Colin, he's so good at so many things.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:55]** He would normally be doing a computer's check, but he's more of a healer.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:58]** He literally healed me back from the dead three times.

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** It's not that long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:21]** these hens for magic it's not here shipping you guys it's or sorry it's not kelly shipping you guys it's here's shipping he's trying to make this happen cool cool colin that's that's really cool that's great yeah yeah uh bernice assists in any computers check okay so that's a plus two


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:29]** Yeah, I have a very healthy computers check, but it's only a dirty 20 in this case.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** So 22 then in total.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** Okay, 22.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:36]** Oh, it's a 22 total.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:42]** Unless Colin wants to get those magical on this keyboard, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:44]** I don't have a computer's check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:49]** It's a good thing that you're great at so many things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** You're going to type in.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** You think you see what's going on.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:57]** You're like, okay, this is a tier three computer.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** It's a tough computer.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** Burn it.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** Can't get in.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:02]** You're close.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** God dang it.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:08]** You feel like I've done this before, but you can't quite get it yet.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:09]** Take 20.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:12]** Do you want to take 10?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:13]** Yeah.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:16]** I mean, if for a computer check, yeah.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** That's what we're doing.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** I thought it was 20, though.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** You can do both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** Take 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:26]** Does this computer have a telepathic interface 2?

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** 2?

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:27]** Sorry.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:56]** like did also also in addition to a keyboard and traditional also he's really good at english yeah i can yeah no it's good it's good thanks here's good also in addition to like also in addition uh no this this is just a normal two or three computer it does not have that cool i'll take whatever time is needed really i mean if if these people are out for okay i can do it okay 10 or 20


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:59]** You think that the take 20, hmm.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:06]** If you take 10, you don't roll a d20, but rather assume that you rolled a 10 on the die.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:06]** Right.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** And then add relevant modifiers.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:15]** If you take 20, similar to taking 10, but instead of a roll of a 10, you assume it's a 20.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:19]** So it takes twice as long, but you get an automatic 20 roll plus your modifier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** Plus your modifier.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:25]** That would be a 33, so that would be definitely good, plus an 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:27]** But it takes 20 minutes, so whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:28]** Right.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** I'm fine.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** We can come up with some bullshit.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:32]** It is Kaniko after all.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** She has some trust built up here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:36]** Also, the task cannot have any adverse effects.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** Yeah, so there's like countermeasures.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** Yeah, if it's trapped or whatever.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:43]** Then you automatically spring them.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** Right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:46]** Yeah, you are capable of taking 20.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:58]** I will say that as you're going through, Kaniko at one point is like, hey, Red keeps looking over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:02]** I mean, it's not unusual that we're in here.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:07]** That's part of the reason why I thought to come with you is because I'm a periton, so we're just using this space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:09]** But Red keeps looking over here.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:14]** So whatever you're doing here, you might want to do it quickly.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:33]** door closed where's red at the security desk yeah on the opposite side of the hallway yeah because there's a window there and then yeah oh there's no window in that room oh yeah oh yeah yeah so that's fine so what you're saying is he's coming but we don't know nico


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:33]** Maybe.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:36]** You know what Colin is also really good at?

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** He's got to get through Rick first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** Rick 19.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** You are about to.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** You're just looking over.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:50]** And then the door opens and Red steps out and starts to make conversation with you.

**[00:59:51 - 01:00:16]** you red stay away here's so you take 20 and what's your total role yeah i took 20 33 okay are we allowed to add the any uh you know what i mean can people assist with a take 20 is that a thing uh i don't know can you assist on a take 20 okay i'm gonna go with no okay well it's red rick kind of scoots by you rick just like hey how's it going it's good to see you hey sylvania

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:19]** And it's just talking, but kind of talking and moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:22]** Hey, Brett, have you ever played a crossword?

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:24]** Sylvania needs a lot of help with hers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:26]** Wow, that's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** Yeah, no, I'm not good at them.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:33]** Do you happen to know the two names for a fish that can fly?

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:35]** Two names for a fish?

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** It's what 37 across is.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** 37.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** I know the answer.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:38]** Salmon wing.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:39]** Is that it?

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:40]** Perfect.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:41]** Great.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** Don't hurry on, though.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** Why don't you continue to join us?

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:46]** High five, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:47]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:50]** Sylvania is enjoying our assistance.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:51]** Real quick.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:56]** Kelly, here's... You are in the computer.

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:05]** You see that there are mostly things here...

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:10]** It's like you're opening up a blank, you know, like Windows 10, 11.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:13]** Like, you know, it's like there's not too much on there.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:16]** It's meant to be a pretty straightforward computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** Public computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:18]** Yeah.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:22]** You do find administrative records for all the Paratons.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:24]** You see their names.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:25]** You see their dossiers.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:27]** You see just their backgrounds, their stories.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:31]** I can share that with you separately just so you can look through it.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** You do see a couple other things.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** Two other things.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:43]** You see that there is a schematic of Tier Cal's base.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:50]** And I'm going to share it into your thing here.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:51]** Boom.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:51]** Show players.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:55]** And there's a bunch of secret things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:55 - 01:02:06]** You'll see that it's laid out and there are triangles that indicate where there are doors and there are orange dotted walls indicate kind of a overall layout.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:07]** All right.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:11]** There is a lot yet we can see, for sure.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:17]** So, I guess we know about maybe three-quarters of the map, or two-thirds, maybe.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:20]** There's a whole extra third that we haven't seen.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:26]** Up past that hallway where Rick, I think, was going to and Bernice got caught, question mark.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:31]** Interestingly... I also see there's a room called, like, um...

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:32]** Do you have names on them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** Yeah, there's no names.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:37]** Did I share with you the wrong thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** Well, no, no, no, no, no.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:38]** It's fine.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** It's fine.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:44]** Here's doing this, like, says to himself, you know, like he always tries to encourage.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:45]** What?

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** What?

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** Where are you going with this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:49]** Never mind.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:49]** Never mind.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** Let's just move forward.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:51]** All right.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:51]** You know what?

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:51]** It's fine.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:53]** You're clicking through.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:59]** And in another section, right, that's listed in kind of like logistics, like facilities, right?

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:01]** And there's another...

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:02]** File.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:05]** That's called safety.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:06]** I am a puppet?

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:10]** It's called safety protocols.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:18]** That's just general, like, you know, it's like standard boilerplate stewards of like, you need to appoint... What to do when you're capturing a hostage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:19]** A floor leader.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:23]** From a gray outpost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:32]** Like, yeah, just like very standard safety things, including a map of the Varos landscape.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:38]** And you can see in the top left corner, I'll show you in just a second, the Stewart's base.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:42]** And you can see another base off in the bottom right.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:48]** And there's a universal symbol for emergency meeting point.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:50]** And I'm going to show that to you now.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:57]** It gives you a scale of about a long ways away, further on the landscape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:02]** So we are in the top left, yeah, of this?

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:04]** Yep.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:04]** You think, yeah.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:06]** You think this makes sense?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:15]** So the map is a large map with just lava pits and rivers everywhere.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:18]** almost like the moon covered with like lava.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:20]** They're called a lava flow, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** Right.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:22]** Yeah.

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:29]** As you're looking at that, there's a, there's kind of a knock, knock.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:32]** And the sound is as if the door is about to open.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** Oh, Dr. Okay.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:37]** Let's come back to you.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:40]** Is, is you, you had a, what?

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:45]** A 20 to 30 something on your perception check, right?

**[01:04:46 - 01:05:11]** will yeah 31 31 you look you're like the holovid display that camera's real nice the climate control panel it's a model that allows you to a lot of this place is voice activated you can you could say what you need right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:16]** I could say, Alexa, play music.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:23]** That's a better mic than anything you think you would need here.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:36]** And you think to yourself, I'm fairly certain that there's a camera recording and a microphone recording in the room that I'm in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:39]** And that's our game.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:43]** Wait, in his room or in the room that they're in?

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:45]** In the room that Dr. K is in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:48]** Here's as he's going through this computer.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:50]** He's like, I'll find out what's going.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:51]** Think I am a puppet?

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:53]** I am not a puppet.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:58]** That's an impossible line, especially in the voice of Yoda.

**[01:05:58 - 01:05:59]** That's where it's from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:01]** I can't do it.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:04]** That's what it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:05]** I'm not a puppet.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:10]** I'm not going to be puppeteered by this gray or supposed steward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:13]** Just under the wire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:15]** Just under the wire.

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:16]** It's so hard to do.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:18]** You really got it in there.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:19]** You tried it a couple times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:20]** We kept cutting you down.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:21]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:22]** What the f*** are you talking about?

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:23]** Because it makes no sense.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:26]** You could fit that in.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:26]** You could have fit that in.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:30]** We'll say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:34]** We'll say.
