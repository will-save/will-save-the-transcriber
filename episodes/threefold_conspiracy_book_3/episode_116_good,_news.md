**[00:00:00 - 00:00:13]** Hello friends.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:21]** Welcome to my channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:23]** Welcome to what's in the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:25]** Episode 167.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:26]** Episode 167.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:34]** I'm your mechanic GM, John Swan, and I'm joined by fellow mechanic and technicians William and Vinny and Kelly and Kev.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:38]** Working on the most badass podcast out there.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** What's in the podcast?

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:41]** One of literally thousands.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** One of literally thousands.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** Proud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** This is a pretty big title.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:44]** Proud.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Proud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** Proud to be one of the most bad.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** No offense, guys, but I don't think we're most bad.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:53]** Proud to be one of, literally one of thousands of the most bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:53 - 00:02:01]** And it's funny, usually that intro is kind of tongue-in-cheek, but no, like, mechanics and technicians is exactly like, we've all turned some wrenches in our days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** Yeah.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:05]** I've never professionally turned a wrench, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:06]** No?


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:06]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:30]** i have why is that just where you get paid to turn the right hustle yeah i guess like john and kevin maybe really what do you mean what do you consider turning a wrench professionally i mean repairing a vehicle you were paid to turn i've never repaired a vehicle and i was paid to repair the vehicle i've never been paid to repair a vehicle turning a wrench means you apply the wrench to some kind of fastener and then turn it you literally turn a wrench


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** Kev, that's called a moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:33]** Creating a moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** Yeah.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** I have a question.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Vinny, wait, what did you do?

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:39]** You were a mechanic or something or a car mechanic for a second?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Yeah.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Wow.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:44]** I did it as a side hustle for, for like late high school.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:48]** And then I spent a summer working as a mechanic in my uncle's garage and like,

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** I still do some side work.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** Side hustles are crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:56]** I would consider I got paid by the U.S.

**[00:02:56 - 00:03:02]** government and your tax dollars to turn a wrench or two on a submarine.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** Does that count?

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** Yeah, I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:05]** That's cool.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:09]** Wrenching on a nuclear reactor I think would count as turning a wrench.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:13]** I think Vinny's come a long way from stalling out in the middle of the I-10.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:17]** freeway and pulling into the median.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:19]** That was a, that was a stressful day.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:23]** That was, that was a stressful time, but you've come a long way and I'm proud of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:27]** My brother had a job interview and they were like, can you go to training right now?

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** And he was like, Hey, I need a ride to train.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** It was like, sure.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** I had no gas.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:38]** Um, and I had like a 1989 car, but it was one of those like fancy ones that had like a digital dash in 1989.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:38]** Um,

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:40]** Wait, which car was this?

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:44]** It was an old 98 Custom with red velour bench seats.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:47]** Oldsmobile 98 Custom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:47]** Oldsmobile what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** Okay, hold on.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** Yeah, an old 98.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:58]** I knew I had to get off and get gas, and I got off the highway, but on the wrong side, and I needed to turn around, so I flipped a Yui.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:02]** But the Yui was to the on-ramp to get back on the highway.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:02]** Oh, no!

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:08]** And then I ran out of gas in the median and like my brother missed training and they let him go.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:12]** And like, really, I did him a favor because that company was shady as.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** Yeah, that was meant to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:19]** That was the shadiest company I think could have ever, like, tried to hire someone.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:22]** And he ended up getting a pretty good job after that, so.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** Solid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:26]** I thought that was going to be a happy ending story, but it was just all terrible.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** It is a happy ending.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** Yeah, it's good.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** Well, I mean, ultimately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:34]** I ran out of gas, and then we found out that John has AAA after waiting an hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:38]** That was definitely one of those moments where I'm like, wait, was John involved in this story?

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** John was in the backseat.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** No, no.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** Your brother was in the backseat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:46]** He's like, I wasn't sure that I could use AAA on somebody else's car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:50]** I truly was like, wait, this whole time I've had AAA in my pocket.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:55]** Just for like an hour in a hot Florida car in the summer.

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:05]** Speaking of companies and highlighting not shady companies and awesome companies, Will, you got something you want to add?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:10]** Yeah, I wanted to shout out two cats who have inspired a friend of a friend.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** Two cool cats.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** This is, this is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:38]** I was trying to decide whether to just cover my laptop and stickers or get a skin.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:44]** And now I think, um, I'm just going to be a huge poser cause I don't have a cat, but I love all of these stickers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** I was going to say, you have to get one now.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:47]** You have to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** So I have to get a cat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:52]** Like I can't, that's part of the purpose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** I'll have to figure that out.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** Are we, that's it for our banter?

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** I think that's it for our banter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** We're just going to transition from the cat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:09]** There was something you guys sent me off with before in the pre-banter stuff.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:11]** We were talking about drinks.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:11]** Oh, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:16]** So I got a pink lemonade from Costco because my kids wanted pink lemonade.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** And so naturally I bought three gallons of it.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:45]** um as one does and i was gonna make a mixed drink before this episode and i had cherry smirnoff and i had deep eddie's lime and i was like which one would this mix with so i thought why not both so i tried both poured a generous pour and gave it a stir had a sip and it's straight up cherry limeade and it's delicious that sounds really good but it reminds me of a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** Which, it was a drink that, you know, I was in the Navy.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:52]** But the whole idea is that you drink enough of it, you will then start skipping around naked.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** Which may or may not have happened a couple nights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** Is it just like Dr. Pepper?

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** No, it's actually several things that I don't like.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:01]** Because I don't like lemonade to start with.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:01]** Really?

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:07]** But what it is, is you take a pitcher, you know, one of those Gatorade canisters.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** Yeah.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:13]** And you fill it up with, I think it's two 12-packs, you know, 24-pack of Bud Light.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:21]** and then you dump in an entire jar of powdered lemonade, and then you pour in a bottle of vodka, and you stir that crap up, and you drink it.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:25]** And it tastes delicious enough to drink fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** This sounds like a prison hooch recipe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:26]** Yeah.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:27]** Oh, yeah, that's what it was.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** That's what it is, though.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:32]** It's a legitimate drink, I guess, if you can put legitimate in front of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:35]** So you get, like, a five-gallon Gatorade jug, right?

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:36]** Uh-huh.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** And it's 24 butt bites.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:40]** You pour a bunch of crappy beer, crappy vodka.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** Or bush light, depending on where you're from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** And crappy lemonade mix.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:45]** And Country Time Lemonade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:49]** And is it like a fifth of vodka?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:53]** I think it varies on how drunk you want to get.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** I don't know.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:56]** It's kind of like a jungle juice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Season to taste, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:58]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** Okay.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** I'm intrigued enough to try it.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** I'm going to buy a five-gallon jug now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Should we make this a Patreon goal?

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** In South Carolina, around a pool.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** It was a good time.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:34]** okay this could be a gin con i'm just saying yeah yeah that's that's something kev's skip and go naked i looked it up it's an actual drink like you can actually find recipes for it proper recipes but professional recipes yeah i mean the most expensive part is the five gallon drop it is but you could substitute you could do that in the bathtub if you had to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** This conversation really took a turn.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:43]** I feel like it would have been better if we had just cut it off right when I was playing it.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** It's because you're no fun, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** Fine, let's take it to the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:51]** I'm just going to leave that silence in there.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:55]** I'm just going to let the silence shame Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:59]** I mean, I'm just shopping Poppy and Bagel right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:02]** Yeah, Will didn't hear any of that because he just bought a bunch of stickers, so it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:05]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** I'm still trying to log on to Etsy, but it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** One day.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:09]** One day.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:10]** One day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** I'll get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** I'll get there one day.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** One day.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:19]** Let's look back at last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** Let's look back.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:24]** Bit of a interesting episode.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** Rollercoaster?

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:25]** Yeah.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** Rick decides to leave.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:35]** After some deliberation, you all say, hey, who's going to stay in and get these vehicles up and running?

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:39]** And Dr. O'Kate, Colin, you're like, you know what?

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** I hit the hay.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** Rick, you're like, me too.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:48]** And as you're going, you cross the hallway from the garage into the warehouse, almost home free.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:52]** And then you hear a door behind you open as the warehouse.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:55]** Something in your mind is like,

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:03]** I need to hide bolt down across this row of, you know, 15, 20 foot tall shelves.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:08]** You hide door opens.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:11]** The light shines on your hands.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** You pull them back.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** You're waiting with beta breath.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:23]** And then the steps leave and the door shuts and you scram.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** You make your way out of there like a cat.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:28]** Talk to Dr. Okay, Colin.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** Start to decompress.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:35]** You all are deciding to head back to your rooms.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** We cut over to Hears and Kaniko.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:39]** You're starting to work on that first police cruiser.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:42]** Kaniko confides in you a little bit.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:44]** Hears, you can tell that she's...

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:58]** Torn about what she has to do, about what it means to ditch Orvier and to have entered into this moray, let's say, of suspense, uncertainty.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:02]** You know, she's unsure.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:13]** But she knows what she knows about the breadcrumbs that have led her here to make the decision that she needs to escape with her crew out from under Orvir and is going to help you as well.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:16]** Because what's going on here is not okay.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:17]** It's not right.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:18]** It's suspicious.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:24]** And there's something going on with these stewards and now with Orvir as well.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:24]** Yeah.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** And in this brief pause, she thinks about it.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** And she talks to you about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:28]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:32]** No, I was going to say, I mean, we all know this, but just restating it.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:38]** Like, she, like, we're really truly just relying on her word for this.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:43]** Like, we have, I think, no direct hand experience of Orville being weird.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:45]** So, as far as I can remember.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** Kevin, what do you think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:51]** And the GM stopped us from going into Orville's room and snooping around.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** Yeah.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:52]** Point that out.

**[00:13:52 - 00:14:16]** yeah yeah that too well that's a good point who did that a couple episodes ago i was like we should go check out orville's room and then you were like no you don't need to do that i don't remember saying you don't need to be right but you could do that if you want exactly exactly how that conversation went she was this through kanika

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:16]** No.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:26]** It was like before we were all going to go back to our rooms or something or whatever, and I was like, Rick won't be the one to go into Orville's room, but Kevin highly suggests it.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:31]** And the next person to speak was John going like, you don't need to do that.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** Let's move on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** Hey, man.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:35]** If you want to do it, you can do it.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:38]** You don't need to... Rick's doing that right now, then.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:43]** Rick is having a moment, and we'll get to that in a second, but...

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** We don't know.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** What is going on here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:50]** We don't know who we can trust or whatever.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:53]** We're throwing our lot in with Kaniko.

**[00:14:54 - 00:15:01]** But I'm just saying, I don't know how much basis we have to do this, especially after everything we've been through, but we're throwing in our lot with her and we'll see how it goes.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:07]** But here's this here for her and her therapy lesson or her therapy session.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:12]** I think we've done enough sense motives on Kaniko to sense her motives.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:14]** Yeah, I think we're in the double digits at this point.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** I still don't care at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:18]** I don't care about sense motive anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:24]** Kev, I'm sorry if I led you astray, but truthfully, you all should do whatever you feel is appropriate for your PCs.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** This doesn't need to be said, but I'm going to say it.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:32]** You should do whatever you feel is appropriate for your PCs to justify the actions that you feel like you need to take in order to leave.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:42]** And whatever that may be, just, I think, trust your gut on that and be the awesome players that you are and live in your characters and work together to figure out what that needs to be.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** Dr. Okay and Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:54]** We all just facepalm inside when you say that.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:57]** And we all love you, but don't trust you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:59]** Because then you gaslight the living shit out of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** Yeah, drink your truly.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** It's not a truly, it's a Celsius.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:11]** So I can keep up the energy to stay on top of this.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:13]** He needs gas to gaslight us, yeah.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:16]** I need some gas, man.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:20]** We can talk more about it too in the plot armor.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:22]** There's more to be revealed there.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** I'm sure.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:33]** This is definitely a note to GMs who do conspiracy or mystery or intrigue campaigns and the effect that the players have and their trust of the GM.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:40]** It's a very real thing when at some point you're going to play a diverse cast of characters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** I trust John with my life.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** but not my PCs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:44]** Whoa.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Wow.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** Definitely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:48]** Thank you.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:48]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:53]** I've never, I didn't know John before the threefold conspiracy, basically.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:55]** So I don't, this is the only experience I have with him.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:58]** So like, he's got like six black belts.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:58]** I do not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** I do not have black belts.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:02]** Nope.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** Nope.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** But thank you, Kev.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** And also, Kelly, don't worry.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** It's all good.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** You're safe.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:08]** You're fine.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:08]** It's cool.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:12]** I can't hurt you from his office.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** I can't hurt you from here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:16]** He can hurt your PCs, though.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:16]** Right.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** Kelly is looking a little pensive.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:20]** He's like, what is going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:23]** I really hope we're all friends at the end of book six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:44]** i think we will be it's all good but truthfully i i do like if there was any undue influence uh of me on your actions in this way other than just through keniko and her stuff i did not mean for that to be there for what it's worth dr k colin you all are a little nervous going to sleep

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:50]** A little anxious, but tired threadbare as Benny said.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:58]** I mean, I think Colin is seeing the cracks in what he thinks is the facade of this store space.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** And so like, what are those cracks?


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:02]** Well,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:13]** The, the unfairly inquisitive doctor, um, the really strange way they've gone about everything.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:17]** The slightly threatening tone of stay where you're supposed to stay.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:22]** The, uh, can he go not trusting or veer?

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:27]** Like there's, there's a lot that just doesn't two plus two doesn't equal four.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** The math isn't mathing for Colin, um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** The surveillance stuff in each of the rooms.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:40]** And then now we learn that there's the weird Pathfinder time warp room.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:44]** And the Aoma Day God's room.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:45]** It's just a chapel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:49]** Storing gray technology backstage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** It's compounding.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** All of it's compounding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:55]** You only found equipment in one of the rooms, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:58]** Where did you come back with that, John?

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:58]** What did he say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:00]** I think you only found equipment in one of the rooms.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** Just turned on the gas light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:07]** So rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** So rude.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** That pilot light went out.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:13]** John just relit it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:18]** Benny knows that feeling well about gas light coming on, so it's cool.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** Rick19 goes to sleep.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:26]** And starts to have a intense dream of moving backwards in time.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:32]** Moving through a life that he feels he knows intimately.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:40]** And then as he's moving backward faster and faster, he feels like he's not the only one watching.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:45]** Let's move out of that and leave the three of you to sleep.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:48]** And go back to Hears and Kaniko.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:51]** We are... In their overnight escapade.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** overnight asking me.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:56]** It's like 7.30 now, right?

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:59]** It's like 7.45 maybe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:03]** It's been... Yeah.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** Is Colin getting jealous?

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** He's like, you're still alone with her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** It's now 8.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** I mean, are we really asleep at 7.45?

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:15]** Are we like elderly people?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:21]** I think John's not scooting time fast enough is the problem.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:24]** I said it took 45 minutes for me to get through the warehouse.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** And you only moved the clock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:29]** I do not remember you saying it took you 45 minutes to get to the warehouse.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:33]** Because at that point, I think Colin and Dr. O'Kane would have been back in their beds already.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** That's true.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:42]** So let's all agree and say it's been like the first hour, because we got through the first hour of Kears and Kineko working on the police cruiser.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:44]** Seven was the shift change.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** Then it was that first hour.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:48]** So to me, it feels like it's like, what, 8, 15?

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** Let's call it.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** It's been some time.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:52]** We've started to work on some things.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** You all are starting to...

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** Chill.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** 1,800 hours?

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:55]** Yeah.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** Is that what she's saying?

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:57]** 2015.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:59]** 2015.

**[00:20:59 - 00:20:59]** No, 2100.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** 2015.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:00]** Not 2100 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:01]** Yeah.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:09]** We're in a bit of a nebulous state because now we're jumping back to the second hour that you're spending working on the second police cruiser.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** Yeah.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:10]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:11]** Yeah.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:13]** And, uh, we're well underway there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** Yeah.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** Yeah.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** You're well underway there.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** I need you to give me, Oh, I didn't, I didn't want that one.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** I wanted this one.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:28]** So you are working on that and there's, uh, you know, she feels, I think, but more at ease.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:34]** She didn't kind of go into this like pensive state anymore.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** So things are just quiet.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:40]** You're working, trying to make as little noise as possible and,

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:49]** While you're working, you can feel the heat of the exterior ambient temperature even coming through this.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:50]** From the automobile?

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:52]** No, from the doors.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** Okay.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** From the doors that are behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** From the surface of the planet.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** Yeah.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:57]** Okay, got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** Yeah.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** So it feels a little warm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:02]** Good girl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:06]** Good girl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Just open up for me right there.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:16]** Good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** Kimiko's like, look here.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:22]** Looking in the corner like, what the fuck are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** All right, I'm going to screw right here.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** And all right, I'm going in now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:32]** Give me an engineering and a computers check this time.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:42]** Because this second one is a bit tougher as you're trying to work through all the programming and all the mechanical work that you need to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** Yikes.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** Yeah.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** You're taking 20 on both of these, right?

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:50]** Oh, well, if it's a 20, then it's a 33 and 30, respectively.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** Okay, that's fine.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** That's enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** The time passes pretty quickly.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:04]** Seeing you worked on the first one, she's able to quickly hand you what you need on the second one.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:10]** There are a few times where you see people walking to and fro.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:17]** You pause for a second each time, try and close what covers you can, and nothing happens.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:20]** I'm going to move time forward even further now.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:23]** It's maybe 2100.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:26]** The lights are a lot darker.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:36]** You can see outside that about an hour ago, you probably lost the main lighting coming from the hallway, and there's now like a soft blue ambient lighting that occurs overnight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:39]** Is it a 24-hour day on this?

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** They've said.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:40]** Whatever it is.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** Yeah, they've.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:45]** There's a general, like, thought in all of Starfinder.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:49]** They all work off of Absalom's time frame.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:53]** Right, but that doesn't mean that the planet that we're on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** That the sun goes down.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** Yeah.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** There's no exterior light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:09]** exterior window here right so you can't see it looks like a system that they have in order to regulate circadian resonance or something like that yeah purposely dim everything okay cool that's smart


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:13]** Yeah, so they dim everything at night.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:19]** And it's the end of the second hour, and you think you're pretty much good.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:27]** You can come in, take these police cruisers, and you are all four registered drivers for these.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:37]** Using these will not indicate to the command center that you have used them and that they're moving out.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:45]** The two things that you do know are still... will still ping the command centers... will still ping the command center is...

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:53]** The sensor on the door of the bay leaving and the sensor for the hangar doors, right?

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:58]** So the sensor and the control for the hangar doors are from the command center.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:05]** These bay doors in the garage, you could probably use a battery to jump it and get it up if you really needed to.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:08]** You didn't try and change the sensor there.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** But maybe you think...

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:15]** I don't need that if I'm just trying to leave and not leave furtively.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** Or maybe you do.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:21]** But she looks over and she's like, so we're all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** These are ready to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:26]** Yeah, looks like I still got it.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** And good job.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Thanks for your help.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:30]** He shuts the hood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** Really loudly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** Whoa, shh, please.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** Cheers.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:34]** Cheers.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** Okay.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** All right.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:41]** I guess, I guess, I guess we head back now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:48]** Tomorrow, she gets kind of a furtive look or a pensive look.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:48]** Tomorrow's the day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** Tomorrow's the day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:51]** All right.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** Let's head back.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** Let's head back.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** You start walking.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:59]** And then there are footsteps outside.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** Here's goes back behind the car.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** Okay.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** Here's runs back behind the car.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:07]** I need you to give me a cell check.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** And Kaniko's going to make a cell check as well.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:14]** As the door opens and the Patra is standing there.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:15]** Fourteen.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:16]** Okay.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:19]** 14 on your stealth check.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:22]** Yeah.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:22]** You run.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** Back.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:30]** And as the door opens, your foot hits one of the wheels.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** Or one of the, like, mounts.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:33]** It's holding it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:37]** Bing!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** The sound of metal clangs.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:44]** And the Pacha steps in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:44]** Hello!

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:44]** Hello!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:47]** His voice carries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:53]** Is there anyone in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:55 - 00:27:02]** And then you see the shadow of a gun come out.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:33]** uh here's is gonna if you're finished he's gonna like cast a ghost sound into like the hallway behind the patra yeah go ahead i i i want to say that's rad it's it's a clear rule in starfinder that you can't clandestinely cast a spell i'm pretty sure there's no way to secretly cast a spell yeah so i don't think it doesn't i don't think you could do that and her not see that something's going on

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Is he behind cover, though?

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** He is.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:37]** Why was I put into initiative order?

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** Yeah, if he's behind cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** Is there a verbal component?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:44]** There's no component necessarily.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** Was it called token spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** Yeah, this is a cantrip.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** Token spell, whatever it is.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:52]** Yeah, so it's fine.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:57]** Well, I mean, yeah, the cover factor, it factors in, doesn't it?

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** It must do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** I just... I don't know that it...

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** It's hard.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:07]** I don't know that you can do that in an all-dark room.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** Should we ask the rules lawyer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** Yeah, let's do it.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:13]** Let's ask the rules lawyer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:14]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** What's the name of this cantrip, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** This is called Ghost Sound.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:22]** I guess they're called token spells in Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:25]** There is a spell called Token Spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** It's not.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** It's Ghost Sound.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Okay.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:29]** Okay.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:54]** uh i i just i i i feel like everyone's better at framing rules questions than i am so i feel like someone else should write it you know it's a cop-out uh what'd you say it's a cop-out just do it just sit down just ask is it possible to cast a spell stealthily does the spell require concentration no uh that's a good question


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:57]** You cannot make a specific spell or sounds like intelligible speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** Are they concealed or total cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:04]** I don't think he has total cover from this.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:08]** Well, yeah, he does, because the whole point is to not be able to see it.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** Then I would say, yeah.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:13]** And I mean, it would be... The thing is, like, is there a light?

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** And because we don't have the components, is there a light?

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:16]** Is there sound?

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:17]** Right?

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:19]** It's not just being able to see it.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** Yeah, like you being able to cast a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:29]** I feel like if there is no mention that there's sound or noise, you shouldn't assume that there is.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:30]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** Yeah, that's fair.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:42]** You could see somebody's hands moving and casting a spell, but if they're behind cover, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** It's a good point.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:47]** I don't want to not rule of cool you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:53]** I just want to make sure that we know everything that we need to know about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:56]** Okay, I think this is the important sentence.

**[00:29:56 - 00:30:02]** A cast spell always has obvious effects that are noticeable by nearby creatures, semicolon.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** It is not possible to clandestinely cast a spell.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:06]** Where does it say that?

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** For age 330.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:29]** but behind cover yeah behind cover behind cover in is this like a dark room is this a well-lit room i i can't see it because it's a dark room it's dark it's a dark room the lights are not on aff is doing some research okay aff being adult friend finder i'll say this to push the story along a little bit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:33]** Because she doesn't see you doing this, Kaniko.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:49]** So as the Patra's walking in and you're thinking about starting to cast ghost sounds, you hear in your head or in your comms, you hear, because Kaniko got a pretty good role, you hear her say like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:54]** Also, Jay said, no, I don't think so.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** Or he actually referenced page 330.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** But, okay, can he go?

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** He just nods at her.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** She can't see you.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:07]** She can't see you, so... Well, I don't get... What's the relevance of that?

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Sorry, I was reading at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:12]** The whole clandestine thing, and John just admitted she can't see you.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:20]** So, like, if you're doing a spell and it's taking your hands, like, movements of your hands, then he can't see, or she can't see you making those movements.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:21]** Oops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:28]** i i would right real cool it would be just let him roll stuff and presumably if she can't see you neither can the patra

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** Yeah.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:29]** That's true.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** Give me a sec.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:37]** I do like the idea of rolling either a stealth roll to... Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:39]** Because that, to me, feels like... I think you should be able to roll a stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:40]** Yeah.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** That's kind of what I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:42]** All right.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:46]** Well, I guess we're saying FU rules fairly.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** No, JK.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:53]** I know that they're, like, typing... Adult Friend Finder and Jay said no, but I did just say total cover.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** Yeah.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** I'm waiting to see both of them say it.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:57]** I'll go with the DM's ruling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:18]** uh as well so because like the the yeah go ahead yeah that's the thing yeah i'll be able to hear you it seems i'm i'm more of the opinion that like the realistic approach would be like if you can class it cast it clandestinely the whole point of the spell is to be able to do that so that just like yeah it

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:23]** You would need a bit of reworking, and I think the reworking is putting it into the hands of the player, a.k.a.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:26]** you, Kelly, and your ability to pass a stealth roll, right?

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:28]** That feels like the right move to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:36]** Or you could take, like, a special feat for silent spell or still spell.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** Yep, yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:49]** But at this point, it's a perception of the Patra that will determine whether or not the spell was seen or heard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:49]** Right.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** So you're going to be rolling against the Patra's roll.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:55]** So would it be a sleight of hand or a stealth?

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** That's a good question.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** Which one?

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:04]** I feel like it would be a stealth, because sleight of hand feels a little bit more... I don't know.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** Just not really the move here.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** It's weird.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:10]** Sleight of hand.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:16]** You can hide small objects, pick pockets, and accomplish other feats of manual dexterity.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** This is like...

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:20]** I don't know that this is quite the manual dexterity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** Apparently Grumpus is also of that opinion.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** But it seems so weird to me.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** It does seem weird.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** Because J.R.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:28]** was like, I believe cover makes you harder to hit, not to detect.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:31]** That seems... I can see mechanically that being the case, but it's strange to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Yeah, see... Go, Will.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:36]** Concealment, right?

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** It's not just cover, it's... Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** Yeah.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** I...

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:50]** The thing is, I don't think that you should be able to cast ghost sounds when you're hiding and it clearly shows where you are and defeats the whole point of using ghost sounds.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** That doesn't make sense to me.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:53]** Just fundamentally.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:57]** I'd say that the will save for the spell might be out of hand unless target passes say they noticed a feature of someone who can't spell.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:58]** The fail save.

**[00:33:59 - 00:33:59]** Exactly.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** Yeah.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Yeah.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:12]** So, JM, I think, ruled it out the way that I was thinking, which is that if the target, I'd say that the will save for the spell might be how to handle this.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:16]** If the target passes the save, then they notice the features of someone having cast a spell.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:19]** If they fail the save, then the effects were distracting enough that they don't put two and two together.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** Is there a will save for ghost sounds?

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** Yes.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** Yeah.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** Disbelief.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** Yeah.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** I think that's the way to handle it.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** We'll save!

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:28]** We'll save!

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:31]** Once again, we'll save coming in handy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:34]** So they're doing two will saves then?

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:37]** Like one for detection and one for if they believe.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** No, just one in general.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** Just one for the spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:44]** You're casting the spell, and if they believe the sound, then the spell worked.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:46]** If they don't believe the sound, then they know where you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** Well, all right.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** I mean, there you go, I guess.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:50]** And then you go invisible, and it's like, what was it?

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:52]** That's true.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** I mean, it's already underway.

**[00:34:55 - 00:35:00]** I mean, the safest thing to do probably would just to have Kaniko take the fall, but I mean, I already talked about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:04]** Well, it depends on how the will save goes, right?

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** And it depends on what the potter does.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:06]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** Can I add one more wrinkle to this?

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** Never.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** Okay.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:14]** I'm assuming, and I wish the spell description said it.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:18]** I'm assuming you have to be able to see where you're trying to cast the spell to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:25]** It would say... Yeah, it would say, I think you have to picture in mind.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** That, I don't think I'm going to rule on that.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** I think you've been in the hallway.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:31]** It just says range close.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:31]** You've seen in the hallway.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** What is the sound?

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Kelly, this is important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:38]** Uh... Fart.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:39]** Fart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** It'll be like... Hold on.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** Let me... Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:48]** If you want to look at the... I have a three-year-old who's obsessed with poop, so... Walking sounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:51]** I was going to say... Shuffling feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:57]** Yeah, I was going to say like... I think like walking and calling from around the corner.

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:00]** I mean, I don't know if you can say like... You don't know their name, but...

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:13]** well i don't even know if you can make language like you can just no it says you can specifically says in the spell you can't make specific sounds such as intelligible speech so it'll just be like you know like chatter yeah like

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:15]** That wasn't good.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:16]** I don't know.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** That's perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** That's intelligible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** I don't know.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:26]** There's got to be some kind of... It's a pirate.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:34]** Somewhere in between absolute ridiculous sounding thing and language because I'm sure it's just not going to be absurdly weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:40]** You're trying to make a voice of a creature from around the corner calling to that or making noise.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** You can make a human sounding thing.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:44]** But let's say in common.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:47]** What is the DC that I need to beat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** DC 15?

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Is that what it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** I've rolled my die and I haven't looked at it.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** I'm going to tell you that they have a plus 5.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** It's their second best save.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** I'm going to look at my die now.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** They rolled.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Is it DC 15?


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:09]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** They rolled a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:14]** That's decent.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** We'll say fail.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** Failed.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** We'll say fail.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** Okay.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** One second.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** You suck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:23]** One second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:26]** Starts to walk out.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** And the door shuts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:32]** Yeah, but it's not over.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:32]** Right.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** We need to make quick.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** We need to make haste and get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** Yes, yes, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:44]** Kaniko, you can see you're starting to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** What if... Damn.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:47]** What?

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** What do we do?

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** Because they might come back in.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:51]** The Vudra.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:52]** Okay, that's why.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:58]** That's why we need to be fast and we need to get across the hallway, I think, and through that storage room.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** Okay.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** And get out the same way Rick did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** Okay, what if we do this?

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** Can you go invisible again?

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** Yeah, I'm going for sure.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:12]** What if this is my time to take a fall and walk out and be like, oh, hello, it was me.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:14]** Whoa, where am I?

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** I just needed this wrench.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:18]** And then you just go invisible and like run.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Can you go?

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:19]** Right?

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:20]** Yeah.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:20]** And,

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** And you go in, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:31]** Okay, I just don't think there's... I think it's a great diversion if you need it, but there's no need to call attention.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:31]** Okay, okay.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:33]** Don't do it unless you really need to.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:33]** Okay, yeah, yeah.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** Okay, fair, fair, fair.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:34]** Okay, cool.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:36]** You might be able to clear your... All right, that's fine.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:36]** Let's go, let's go.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** I'm invisible again.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:37]** Okay.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** You can't see me.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** Ha, ha, ha, ha.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** Let's get out of here.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** Where are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** All right, where are you?

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** Okay, ready?

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:43]** Three.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** I'm right behind you.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:47]** Okay, three, two, one.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:49]** We're going to open the door and then go.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:51]** Yeah, open the door for me so it makes sense.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:51]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:51]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** Doors open.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** You step out.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** Give me a stealth check.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** You should still have... I'm invisible.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** Yeah, but noise.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** Yeah, you gotta add to it.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** Yeah.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Fair enough, fair enough.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:11]** And as you're walking in the hall, you look to your right and you see that Patra is talking to a Shirin.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:14]** They're two... They're both wearing stewards.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** God, is it... What's his name?

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** Is it frickin' Silverton?

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:18]** No.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** That useless motherfucker.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:19]** It's not.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:19]** No.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:22]** No, it is a... It's a host Shirin.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:42]** there's so many sharing that so many people here we haven't met or forgot that we met okay uh here's a roll to five but i think stealth is plus like a million right well for invisibility if you're moving that the sorry invisibility it's plus 20 so it's plus 20 so 25 so 25 for you to go across okay uh

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:44]** Keniko got an 18.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:48]** Are you going to open the door?

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** She steps out with you.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** She's going to open it for me, right?

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:51]** Yeah.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:52]** To make it look not ridiculous.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:53]** Yeah.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** So she goes to open the door.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:58]** And before you step in, I'm going to pause it because now I need to roll and see if they noticed you.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:03]** Because right now, all they see is Keniko in the hallway and they can't see you.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:33]** they actually see her though well that's what we like if if they notice yeah yeah if they if they notice so you got a 25 right sorry who else was in the hallway uh there was a there's a a host sharon and a patra a female patra what is a hope what do you mean so sharon's have like three genders there's male female and i think it's host right right uh where it's like not quite uh yeah um so thing cool so can you go got an 18 you got a 25

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** Okay.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** The door opens.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** They both turn around.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** I'm going to unpause.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:52]** Sorry, I want to make sure we're counting Kelly's stealth correctly.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:55]** So he is invisible?

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** Yes.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** And moving.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** So that is a plus 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** And he got a 25.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:00]** To his stealth.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** And he got a 25, yes.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** He rolled a 5 and got a 25.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:04]** What's your other stealth?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** And what is your normal stealth?

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:08]** My normal stealth is plus 3.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Oh, so 28.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** Okay.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:10]** 28.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** Thank you.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** Good catch, Kev.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** Okay, cool.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** Good catch.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:13]** The door opens.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** I didn't know that's how it worked.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:21]** The door opens, and they both, both the Shirin and the Patra, turn around.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Well, bye, Kaniko.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** It was good knowing you.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:29]** And Kaniko immediately... He just pushes her.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:42]** Kaniko immediately reaches to her side and is just like, Hey, I was just trying to find this wrench here and it's crazy.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:44]** I didn't have any on the ship.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:48]** So I just thought that I would go ahead and...

**[00:41:48 - 00:42:05]** pop over in here and you see the patra and the sheeran are starting to walk looking at her they and they haven't said anything yet and what are you doing kelly are you're still standing in the hallway what do you do you you can see that behind her back actually i'm gonna roll stealth

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** Well, he also is.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** He's not moving, right?

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** You're not moving.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:09]** Plus 40.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** You're not moving.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:17]** So she is kind of like, she's like, yeah, you know, like, I just needed this one wrench.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:22]** And she's trying to, like, kind of tilt her head to be like, go, go, go into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:23]** Is the door open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** The door is open.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** That's my next question.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** The door is open because she opened it.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** Here's his going in.


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:41]** I was just trying to, and she kind of like leans over and you think for a second, you hear her just talking and you hear the podger be like, what were you doing in there?

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** You fucking fool.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:44]** And then the door shuts.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:46]** Why are you so mean?

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:54]** And then the door shuts and you hear the soft muffled voices of Kaniko saying that she just needed this wrench.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:58]** And she really thought that she would be able to find it on her ship.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** And she couldn't.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** That's a really important project.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:08]** And she is definitely trying her best to use all of her plus 15 diplomacy in order to get her way out of this.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:09]** What do you do?

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** You're alone in the warehouse.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:14]** You can still hear them talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:40]** very muffled can i make out what they're saying no it's not intelligible like like no sense well here to preserve he needs to get out of every restricted area with the amount of invisibility that he has so he's going to make it to the other side and go into the hangar which is not restricted correct right okay he's going out that way okay uh because he doesn't yeah okay he's going to try to make it back to the room um okay we accomplished our mission for the time being so


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** You did accomplish your mission.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** I mean, we got two of the three cars.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** Did we get all three?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** You got all three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** We got all three.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:48]** Okay.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:48]** Sorry, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** Go ahead.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** I'm your boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** I got you.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:59]** I was going to say, like, metagame, if you wanted to, like, help her out, you could be, like, make a ruckus in the cargo bay and be like, where's that reg?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:02]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** Yeah, I guess I could do that.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** That's a cool amount of flavor.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:13]** Like, he'll call over the comm to Kaniko and be like, Kaniko, come in.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** Come in, Kaniko.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** It's nothing.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** Did you get the wrench, Kaniko?

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** I'm over here at the ship.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** He's been gone for a while.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** I'm kind of worried about you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** There's nothing.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** Really?

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** Oh, they jammed her ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:44]** They're really questioning me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:45]** Why is your comm off?

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:48]** Can you turn your comm on so I can call over and try to help you?

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:50]** I don't... Try to get you a story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:08]** Is there any diversion that you can make so I can try and get out of this room?

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:13]** Cause I, I think, I think, I think I'm supposed to talk to inspector herd.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:15]** You're supposed to talk to top.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:16]** What's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** They're going to bring you to talk.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:18]** Okay.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** He's he's here.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:22]** Hey, just, um, look, it's all good.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:25]** Uh, just if you can make a diversion, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:28]** And then like the thought, uh,

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:35]** Of her talking to you kind of melds into what she's saying because she starts speaking, right?

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:39]** And so her brain is now focused on talking to who she's talking to in the room.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:46]** And for a brief second, you kind of hear her saying like, hi, yeah, I was just looking for the wrench in there.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:56]** And then that fades away because she's not trying to like talk to you, but you can like feel her focusing on the conversation and then it fades and then it fades away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:57]** All right.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:07]** I feel dumb because I don't know what would actually be a proper diversion to distract the people and get them to, I mean, besides insane stuff, like, you know, shooting lasers out of the ship in this, like, yeah.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:11]** Does anyone have any ideas or would he, could he, what could I do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Wrong button.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:14]** Oh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:18]** Open the pod bay doors, Hal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:27]** The warehouse door has the alarm on it, but it didn't go off the first time we went through it, so I don't know why it would go off again.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:30]** Her voice comes back into your head.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** Probably hack into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:36]** She's like, I think I'll be okay.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** I think we're all good.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** I think they're going to let me go.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:41]** And I think we'll be okay.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:46]** Jock's just threatened me, but it's fine.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** Stay with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** Stay with me until you're free and clear.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** Where are you going?

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** How are you getting out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:59]** Well, they're letting me go now, so I think it should be okay.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:02]** I think I'll be okay if I just start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** Yeah.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Am I good to go?

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** And that voice kind of like fades away.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:12]** And then you don't hear from her for another few minutes.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** I mean, he's just waiting for her to come out.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:17]** He assumes she's going to come out of this door.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:20]** I hope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:23]** Her out that door or the security door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:27]** He tries to contact her and he's like, which door are you coming out of?

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** Can you go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** There's still no response yet.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:34]** Just waiting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** What do you do?

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** Do you wait?

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** It's now like 930.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** You've been waiting for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** So a couple.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** How long have I been waiting?

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** She said a couple minutes.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** Has it been that long already?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** It starts to.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:45]** Yeah.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:45]** Yeah.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** It starts to get a little longer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** Great.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:50]** Well, fantastic.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** I guess here is like.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:57]** I feel so agency-less and sad.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** I really don't know what to do or what I can do.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** Holy shit, who's that?

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** Who's what?

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:02]** What?

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:03]** Wait.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:09]** Who's this guy that kind of looks like a weird Duke Nukem looking dude guarding the brick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:12]** Oh, that's Brick.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** Brick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:15]** I don't know why I'm not used to seeing him look like that.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** He looks like a cop from an 80s show.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** I forgot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:21]** You probably couldn't see him last time.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:26]** That's the new guard that came out in the previous episode.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:29]** What's her name?

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** Naomi or something?

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** Sylvania?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:08]** God, she was, like, fascinated.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** All clear.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:18]** Yeah.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Just notive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:23]** And then, hey, Brick, good to see ya.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:47]** yeah good to see you it's good to see you too yeah i was worried about you all right let's get back to the project there right and brick just doesn't say anything yeah yeah it's a star wrench all right perfect that's exactly what we need to come up here brick totally is like weirdly doesn't say anything does look like the strong silent type brick does he wasn't strong and silent when he was talking to dr okay and you all turn down the hallway and start walking into the hangar

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:54]** And she, she like looks at you and she's like, that was wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:54 - 00:51:03]** They asked me so many questions about why I was in there that had nothing to do with like this wrench.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** And it felt like.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:10]** It felt like they knew that something was up, but I just couldn't put my finger on it.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:20]** And when I was walking out, Dr. Nodens kind of was standing in the hallway and nodded at me.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** And it's not like in what kind of way?

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:25]** Just not just like it's good to see you kind of way.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** And I was really creeped out.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:27]** Yeah, it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:29]** Did she interview you at all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:34]** No, I think they were maybe going to try and get her to come in.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:35]** But here's the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** You guys check the the.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** We will.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:57]** Yeah.

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:05]** Look, I was able to sweet-talk him a little bit, lean into the Orvier stuff, and I think they bought it for what they needed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:12]** You know, like, just kind of lean into, like, Orvier and I working on something together and trying to make some upgrades to the Periton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** And it just needed to be done tonight.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:17]** And, yeah.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** I think...

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:24]** I said to them, we're trying to get out of here tomorrow.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:31]** That was a white lie of like, in general, like, oh, you know, I think like the Peritons have another, have something coming up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** I was talking with Orvier.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** That was a white lie.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:36]** So I was kind of like, we're like, we need to make this repair right now.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:42]** I've been working a lot, working, busting my ass to get this ready so we can all jet tomorrow.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** And they kind of nodded.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:47]** So I think we're, I think like, it's cool.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:47 - 00:53:11]** to be fair we are trying to leave tomorrow yeah yeah so she's like yeah yeah two truths a lot but it was a politician it was it was that that was to inspector heard and otherwise it was the patra and the sharon who were talking to me originally then inspector heard came in and then they all they let me go inspector heard left and kind of give them a nod and then


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:15]** And then I, I, I just assumed that I was not being held there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** So I, so I left.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** Excellent work.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:20]** Can you go, let's go into the ship then to make it look like we're doing whatever.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** Yeah, absolutely.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:21]** Absolutely.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:23]** Like get out a couple minutes.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Okay.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** Yeah.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** All right, so you go in.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:29]** She is able to walk in.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:37]** You see the inside of the Periton ship, and it's smaller than the Voidcrier, but it's definitely a nice top-tier ship.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** They keep it really pristine.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:42]** They literally run it like a tight ship.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** There are logs.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:48]** There's a very clear order of maintenance and everything else.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:51]** Would it have enough room for all of us to just steal it?

**[00:53:51 - 00:54:14]** to to fit all of you and to fit the peritons you wouldn't all have a place to sleep but the thing is is that right but like you could still go on shifts yeah yeah yeah you you could be on there again that the issue is that you don't have control over that door trying to leave right that's that's that's part of the issue and then uh yeah she walks on there for a second and then

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:21]** you know, she is clearly shaken and like half-heartedly showing you kind of stuff.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** And then she's like, all right, let's, let's just go back.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:24]** Let's go back.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** All right.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** And she leaves.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** Do you return the wrench?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** She... There's a drop box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:32]** No.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:36]** She... I'm just going to actually return the wrench tomorrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** That's what I told them.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** And they were fine with that.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** I'll just hand it off to somebody.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** All right, perfect.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:44]** Let's get some good rest, okay?
