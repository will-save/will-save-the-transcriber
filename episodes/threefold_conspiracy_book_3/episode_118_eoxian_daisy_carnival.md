**[00:01:45 - 00:01:45]** Hi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** Hello.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** I mean, is that really what we've come to in 2024?

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:53]** We've simply commoditized astral projection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:59]** You mean like people selling books on how to do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:05]** We are astrally projected across four different rooms in this country.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:06]** Digitally projected.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** Digital plane and astral plane are two separate things.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Who's the book by?

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:15]** I just Googled it.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:18]** The top thing that popped up is actually a slide share, but it's by Frank Keppel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:19]** I don't know.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:21]** K-E-P-P-L-E.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:24]** How much would you pay for an astral projection service?

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** From Frank?

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Pretty low.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Frank.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:34]** Wow, you're just hating on Frank for no reason right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** He's probably a seasoned veteran.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** You don't think Frank's a real astral projectionist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** I don't know, man.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:44]** Oh, and it's a most detailed book on astral projection by Robert Monroe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** Robert, my guy.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Love that guy.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** I mean, I know Aaron Pavlina, but that's about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:49]** Oh, here we go.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** This is more my jam.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:55]** There's TikTok videos on it, so that's what I'm doing today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:55 - 00:03:01]** I did see you on TikTok as somebody that I could send videos to, so I was like, wow, I didn't know you were actually on.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:01]** Yeah.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** Wow, that's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:05]** I scroll TikTok endlessly and never say anything.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** That's my...

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** Hey, guess what?

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:37]** We have another subscriber.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** Intro and banter.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** Sorry, banter and sentence.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** And I'm excited.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Do they come in pairs?

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** It's banter and a sentence?

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:49]** I would like to do both of them because we're starting to get more now.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:53]** And if you have more, please send them in if you're already a subscriber.

**[00:03:53 - 00:04:00]** And if you're not, you can send in what you would like us to banter about and a sentence that we have to include in the game.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:03]** And we'll guess or the players will guess who it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:04]** Yep.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Fun PSA.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:07]** We send out the reminder once a month.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:10]** You are welcome to send in whatever you want at any time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Literally any time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]** We just remind you once a month because we're cool like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:22]** So like, so is it, is the, like you said, it's, it's paired now you're doing, uh, well, you have to come that way.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:35]** Cause like last week it was taco monk gave us a suggestion for the topic and his, his sentence popped up in the thing, but it's, but he called me out on, that was one of the first ones that we guessed.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:36]** That's good.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** Yeah.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:38]** That's good.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:38]** That's good.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** But you're also just playing.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:46]** Don't, don't let it break the, the, the, the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:46 - 00:05:14]** i'm gonna say that to you at jack on the entire time kelly all right let me so what i do is i is i is i roll both time based on our availability i i just randomly will choose one so for for both so it might not always be lined up so let me get the sentence and then i will do the banter so this sentence let's see is it gonna be okay cool

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:15]** Got the sentence.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:19]** I'm going to roll and see who gets the sentence.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** Okay, cool.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** Noted.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** Based on all of this.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** And now, the banter.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** It's me this time.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** Let me roll for it.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:29]** Okay.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** Banter.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** Let's start talking.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** As I send out the sentence, the banter is this.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:41]** If the We'll Save team was planning a heist, who would do what role in the heist?

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:41]** Examples.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:45]** Getaway Driver, Savecracker, The Face, etc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:48]** Are these our cast or us as people?

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** I think cast.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** Here's an obvious one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:54]** So our characters or us personally?

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** I think us personally.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:55]** Yeah, us personally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** Like the cast.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** Like

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:00]** I'd be the getaway driver, I feel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:04]** Yeah, show of hands who's successfully picked a lock in this room.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** Okay, I guess Will and I would have to pick it out.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** I've successfully driven a car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:14]** Yeah, but I mean, I would gladly... I feel like I could do any role in a heist, personally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:14]** Right.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:20]** Like, we're so well-versed in all... Because...

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:24]** If you think about it, a heist is just a dungeon crawl where they've given you the map ahead of time.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** Yeah.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:30]** So, like, we've each crawled enough dungeons that, like, no, after you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:34]** I feel like I could stall for time and be the face.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** I feel like I could disable alarm system.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** I could definitely be a wheel man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** Like, yeah.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:39]** Yeah.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:44]** We might just have to, like, set a timer and take turns.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:46]** Every eight minutes, we just, like, shift roles.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:51]** It's like speed dating, but robbing a bank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** We'll just rob four banks.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** Was John a part of this, too, though?

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** Yeah, what's John's role?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Well, I'm looking at...

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** What are the typical roles?

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** So we have the mastermind.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** We have the burglar.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** We have the con man.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** I'm just going from sources across the web.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:12]** Hacker, driver, the muscle, the safecracker, the partner in crime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:23]** I think Kev would be the contortionist who would be in the small metal box that gets wheeled into the Bellagio Casino.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:46]** delivered yeah oh yeah yeah that's good yeah he's possible i couldn't do that he is like that i think i would be the con man given these things so that would be fun to play i think so i think i would be either i don't know no you'd be the mastermind of it yeah i'm pretty sure that's probably true three countries over who's orchestrated the whole deal


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:50]** Yeah, and I have a plausible alibi that I'm at some big gala while it's happening.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:50]** Sell us out.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** No, get out of here.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:53]** No, I would never do that.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:56]** I would definitely not pull off the whole plot of the D&D movie.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** There's no rats in our crew.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** It's fine.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** No, of course not.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** Yeah.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** We'll never do that.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** Well, that's pretty easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:03]** We'll make it out.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** Like at Ocean's Eleven.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** Yeah, we know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** See, we're already a good team.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:07]** What would we steal?

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** We're a good enough team to do that.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** What are we stealing, though?

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:14]** This is my own add-on to the question, because now I'm just curious.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:14]** What are we stealing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:17]** It would have to be something of minimal value.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** Oh, art would be good.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** Art would be really good.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:20]** That'd be, like, awesome.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** Art?

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:42]** yeah we're stealing pez dispensers yeah we're gonna very valuable ones though yeah the valuable ones that uh illegally were imported into the uh united states for the aftermarket which is there's a good documentary about wow the gray market for pez yeah there's a dude there's a gray market there's a pez i forget the name of the movie apparently


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:44]** Do they not make Pez dispensers anymore?

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** Is this something I don't know about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:45]** I don't know.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:48]** It sounds like it'll be pretty peasy to me.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:53]** There's a movie called The Pez Outlaw.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:54]** What the?

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:57]** I can't tell if that's a great name or a silly name.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:02]** If you Google it and you see this dude, you'll know that it's real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:20]** yo this guy he has like a circa 2020 will beard except it's like all white circa 2020 will be you sure this just isn't one of the council of wills it might be i don't know is there a way to verify yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:23]** I don't know if he operates under an alias or not.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:30]** So they were banned in California because of the ingredients, not because they're a choking hazard or anything.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:32]** So you can still buy Pez dispensers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** Wait, it was banned in California?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** Wait, what was the ingredient?

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:35]** I don't know.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:39]** According to allrecipes.com.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** That old chestnut.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** What did the ingredient do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:59]** oh it's just like red number six or whatever or number three titanium dioxide you know just rewrite your dna and yeah gives you cancer it's just all that stuff start like you know opening your mouth like a dispenser or something like that you just transform into like oh wow


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** Dude, I know what's going to happen.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** Like the Canadians in South Park.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:06]** Those are the enemies in the taco monk one shot that we play.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** The Pez dispensers?

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:14]** The Pez dispensers are the enemies because they start making the tacos open into Pez dispensers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** This is it.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** This is it.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:22]** Yeah, the thing about a taco, especially a hard shell one, is opening a Pez dispenser is not possible.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** You're going to snap.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:25]** So we've got to stop them ASAP.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** I'm a soft taco, though.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:29]** I'm just flapping around, so it's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** Dang, wow.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:33]** So there will be hard Taco Monks and soft Taco Monks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:39]** I asked Taco Monk last episode what he... Wait, did he get back to me?

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:41]** I asked him what kind of tacos he likes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:44]** He said anything with no cilantro and burrito.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** Burrito tacos are fantastic.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** Yeah, he does.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** Oh, rough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:52]** I'm assuming he does because he responded with a soap emoji.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** Oh, wait.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** No, Leslie responded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** They responded with the soap gene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** Yeah.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Beria is so good.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** Beria is so good.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** Dude, it's so good.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:03]** I don't think I've ever had a good Beria taco.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** What?

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** Whoa, bro.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:09]** You live in, like, not California.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** Where do you live, Florida?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** That's why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:38]** We walked there from your place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** You sure we walked there?

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:41]** Was that Salazar?

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** That's not a taco place.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:44]** Google it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:48]** That is a taco place, but it's not the same as a taco truck.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:48]** It's not a taco.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** We didn't walk there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** It's not like Taco Zone next to Vons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** Yeah.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:56]** Or like... Was this a long time ago, Vinny, or the first time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:59]** Uh, when I was there most recently for your engagement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** Dang, what taco place was that?

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** I don't know.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** I'll have to look it up.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** I think, I think it was Salazar.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Good Mexican.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** Uh, but they have other things besides tacos.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:08]** I mean, you gotta have like street tacos.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** Yeah, that's the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** Cause they are different.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:12]** California's tacos come to you.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:15]** It's like literally how we have tacos.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Oh, there is a taco.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:18]** There's a taco place near the beach called flying iguana.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:19]** That was really good.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:22]** Their margaritas were also very good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** It sounds like the name of a team.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:29]** There was a street taco truck at Golden Row Brewery every Tuesday during trivia when we used to go there.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:39]** And they did, not only did they do excellent tacos, they had, I forget what cactus is, the like veggie, cactus veggie mix.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** What?

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** They cook cactus.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** Oh, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** I've had that before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:48]** It's actually lingua and all sorts of stuff.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:50]** But then they also did these chinchillas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:53]** I don't get down with lingua or cabeza personally, but...

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:54]** I have before.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** But wait, what's the cheese ball?

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:57]** Not anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:57]** I've evolved.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:06]** They would literally just throw like a circle of cheese onto the grill and let it grill enough to turn into like a tortilla-ish texture.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:07]** Vampiro, yeah.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:09]** And then they'd throw in some whatever meat on it and roll it up for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:11]** Yeah, that's a vampire taco, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:14]** Cholesterol is just calling me.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** So good.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:15]** Come on now.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** Talks about 1986.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:18]** Yeah.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:21]** That and the 1986 is very good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:26]** The food truck near campus that we used to go to for football games.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** Is that Taco Zone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** Is that the one?

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:32]** Is that the one on Alvarado?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:38]** No, it's on Hoover, but it's in an AutoZone parking lot, which is why it's called TacoZone.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:40]** It's like right next to TacoZone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** There's a TacoZone on Alvarado and Silver Lake.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** It shows up at Devon's parking lot.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:47]** I know what you're talking about.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** What do you mean?

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:24]** Is there anything I'm missing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:30]** You know, I'm actually really curious, since we've talked a bit about tacos, are there any good tacos in Indianapolis, you think?

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:33]** Good question.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** I don't want to answer that.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** I don't think we should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:40]** I'm going to ask my buddy, but he's going to tell me no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:48]** We should find out in a week and a half when we're all in Indianapolis for Gen Con.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:48]** Hey!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** We're going to Gen Con.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** You guys should come and meet us and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** Kelly, where are we having our meet up at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** It's at a place called

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** Tappers.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:59]** The bar house.

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** Yeah.

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** Tap house.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** It's called Tappers.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Tappers.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:05]** It's called Tappers in Indianapolis, Indiana.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:08]** The state where NASCAR was born in.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** I don't know.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** And then like we're there.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** Al pastor.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:50]** It's got pretty good reviews for people who've never had good tacos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** I know.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** It looks good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:54]** That's the problem with Yelp.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:58]** It's like you're eating the local flair, and that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:03]** You can eat the local flair, but it's not going to be like what you... Number one taco brand in America is Taco Bell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** Ugh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:06]** There's a Taco Bell cantina tonight.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** I don't slouch on Taco Bell.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** I like Taco Bell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:11]** It's fine, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** Benny does not like Taco Bell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:13]** He never has.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:17]** How about... Okay, I was in Chicago for work a couple weeks ago.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** Story time.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** Last story, and then we play.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:23]** And there was a, it has nothing to do with star finder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** Not a star finder.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:30]** There was a, there was sort of like a dance party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:36]** And like, we're all lamenting about how our feet hurt.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:39]** And then one random person is like, we should go to Taco Bell.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** It's like a mile away.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:44]** And everyone else is immediately like, yes, Taco Bell.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:48]** So we start walking to Taco Bell because we're idiots in Chicago, downtown Chicago.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** Well,

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** It's midnight on a Friday night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:54]** There's a thousand places that are already in Chicago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** A few weeks ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** Love Chicago in the summer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** We're walking to Taco Bell.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:04]** We're walking down the sidewalk.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:06]** We've been drinking for hours.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:11]** There's a party bus on the sidewalk.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:14]** There's people getting into the party bus.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** They're playing loud music.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** They're getting hyped.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** We're just walking down the street.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** I was like...

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:46]** it's my time to shine so i throw down the cleanest gritty i've ever thrown in my life the bus goes wild the people on the sidewalk go wild it was a whole vibe and then we went to taco bell saw a bunch of people that also work in the platform that we work in and you know taco bell at midnight in chicago is a weird place to be yeah could talk about midnight could you explain to the uninitiated be a weird place to be


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** What is a gritty?

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** What is a dance?

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** That's a dance, right?

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:54]** Where you just go like, kind of like do a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:56]** I think he lost us all on that one.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:03]** I think Benny's going to demonstrate now, right now, in what may be the second cleanest gritty he's ever done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:08]** So how do I do that attached to a wire?

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:23]** So it's a, it's a, I'm like doing it in the chair and I can't like, how do I, so you shuffle your feet with the beat one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, but you spend two beats with your hands up by your head and your two beats with your hands back Naruto style.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** And you just like, oh, okay.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:26]** I see.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** Shuffle down.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** And then you can throw like a twist with it.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:33]** So like I kind of did a, did a little back and forth down the sidewalk.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** It was a good time.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:38]** I will throw down a gritty in Indianapolis, and if you want to see it, you should come to our hangout.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** How many drinks is it?

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:40]** It's extra, though.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:42]** We're going to charge you extra for that.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** I think zero.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** Zero drinks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** A two.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:50]** Just a challenge of being thrown down is enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:55]** What's fun is it depends on the liquor what type of gritty I'll throw down.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:55]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** Yeah.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:01]** So if I have more tequila, then I'll have a little bit more of a Mexican flavor.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:04]** If I have, you know, whatever, whatever.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:07]** If I have Dr. Pepper, it might look more like Kev.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:07]** We don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:12]** We might have to conduct an experiment over at Tapper's then.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:12]** I'm down.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:16]** For Vinny to demonstrate the flavors of gritty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:19]** There's a lot going to go down at Tapper's.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** There's the pinball tournament.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:24]** There's Vinny's gritty cabaret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:27]** I'm going to be dancing at a pinball machine is how that's going to end up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** I'm down.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** I should have set up a Gen Con event.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** So Kev will show you his tattoo after three drinks.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** That's true.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:34]** Probably after one drink.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:35]** One drink.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:37]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:37]** He doesn't even have to drink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:40]** We're a bunch of lightweights here on Los Angeles Podcast.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** Which tattoo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** The tattoo you don't show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:46]** So Tapper's Friday night at 7.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** What time?

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:47]** 7 o'clock.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** 7 o'clock, baby.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:49]** Central time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** It's going to be a good time.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:54]** It's going to be a good time.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** Friday night, August 2nd.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:56]** Local time.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** August 2nd.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:57]** Local time.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** Swing gritties.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:01]** You might be down to throw a gritty with you, Colin.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** Can you go breeze?

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:05]** Does Canico know how to gritty?

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:09]** Dude, does Canico Breeze know how to gritty?

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:12]** She taught the other Peritons how to gritty.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** Come on now.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** Okay.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** I didn't know Canico got down like that.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:17]** Oh, dude.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:18]** I'm here for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** There's a lot you don't know about Canico.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:25]** What?

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:31]** So, last time, Canico said, Colin, you want gritty with me?

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** He's like, yeah, I'm down.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** Let's go on a date.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** Let's get drinks.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** Are we confirming it's a date?

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** Let's get drinks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** That's what she said.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:41]** I thought it was drinks, which leads to the gritty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** I heard a drink.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** Now you guys are just conflating everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:49]** She said... I mean, there's at least plural if they're getting one each.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** That's true.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:52]** Unless they share one.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:56]** A little heart-shaped straw.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** That's nice.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:00]** The straw that comes out of your head.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:01]** That's nice.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:02]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** Vinny is semi-red.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** He is.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:12]** Also, in my notes for the recap this week, I only have three words.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:13]** It's in all caps.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:15]** It says decided on mutiny.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:17]** That's the only recap that I have.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:21]** So that is what you all pretty much decided to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:25]** And you break into Orvier's domicile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:28]** Just to be clear, we didn't decide on a mutiny.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:29]** The Peritons did.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** And we helped name their operation.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:34]** Because we can't mutinize something that's not our leadership.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:38]** Because we couldn't come up with a better name for an operation of mutiny.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** That's what I was saying.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:41]** Because we're civilians.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:44]** We're not involved in this.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** Operation Daylight.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** I don't know.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** Operation something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:52]** This would be a coup or a treason, but not a mutiny.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:52]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** Operation Liberation.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** How is this not a mutiny?

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:58]** We're literally stealing the ship with the second in command.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:00]** But we're not under the command.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** So we are not a part of the mutiny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:04]** We're also not stealing the ship.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** The action is a mutiny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:05]** Right.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** We're not involved in the mutiny.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** That's all the paratroops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:12]** We are unlocking the... We are borrowing a car.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:37]** is it also not mutiny though we're not mutiny because we're not part of the crew so how could it be a mutiny kevin always really really high mental acrobatics checks of course when it comes to these kinds of things i mean it's just like a perfect example it's still a mutiny how else is he going to get up those hills kelly we're just not necessarily directly related to it exactly he's just doing mental acrobatics all the way up the hill by every hill

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** Alright, moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:43]** I'm going to pause the game.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** I'm going to bring you guys.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** Back to the map.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:58]** Seriously, I think you all did a fantastic roleplay episode coming up with the real feelings around D-Day.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** Lock and load.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** Let's do it.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:09]** Coming up with the real feelings as you wake up in the morning being like, we will go to sleep tonight.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** someplace else.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:14]** Hopefully, you know, on the ship trying to get out of here.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:17]** We will go to sleep someplace other than Tyrkala's base.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:21]** Because that's the ultimate objective to Operation Mutiny.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** Is to be able to sleep someplace else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:24]** Yep.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** That's it.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:25]** Nothing else.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** No other reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:36]** So, you all have a good... We are saying we would feel safer in literal hell than on this base with...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** Which is also literal hell.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:40]** It's like a fiery landscape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:43]** There's probably one less group of doctors outside.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:44]** Right.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:45]** At least true.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** Asking unnerving questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:47]** It's true.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:54]** And all these holes in the facade that is this Tercalus Steward's base.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:56]** But did any of you try walking out the front door?

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** So...

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:05]** Like I said, you all have, I think, kind of a come-together moment with the stewards.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:13]** And it's part of that that you all said, all right, they are going to give a tour with the Paratons.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:13]** Sorry.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** You have a come-together moment with the Paratons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** Okay, this is tripping me up.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:20]** So this is like the fourth time now that John has called the Paratons the stewards.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** I don't know if it's a slip of the tongue.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** Is there Dr. Freud in the house?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:29]** So the Peritons are going to give a tour to the stewards at the party.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:30]** Yeah.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:34]** And that is how they're going to get on the ship without raising suspicion.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:38]** You all will have checked out of the party by then.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:44]** And according to the surveillance in your room, you'll be playing terraforming Akaton.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:50]** But really, you'll be making your way over to the command center to open the hangar doors.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:55]** You also have talked a bit about maybe we can see what more information there is.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:56]** Yeah.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:58]** See what data is there.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:07]** Rick has said, I am very concerned about Orvier and I feel like it's a blind spot for us.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:10]** We haven't done enough to look into Orvier.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:18]** So Rick hears Bernice and Kaniko are going to Orvier's room and

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:42]** now i'm calling now i bet orveer's dead in this room just laying there lifeless i don't think so dr k is kind of setting up a distraction looking like you're looking for bernice playing a cool colin is working off some of the nervous energy in the gym going for a run and while you're opening the door

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** Because you had determined that it was locked.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:49]** Here's you're under a bit of time pressure here because you are needed to open the door.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:53]** But you're getting texts from Shay saying, hey, I want to give you an update.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** Can we meet in the hangar?

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** And you're making them wait a bit.

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:01]** And I believe last time we went.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** And we opened the door.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:08]** We ended on the three, two, one that you all say together very loudly in the room, in the hallway.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:11]** You just go three, two, one, like it's a surprise party.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** And everyone knows what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:19]** Yeah, Dr. OK is going to quietly speak into the comms.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** I don't know, but I think they might be on to us.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** Just a feeling.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** I don't have anything definite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** We're going to check to see if there's comms in there.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** Sorry, cameras.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:35]** You did have a conversation with Sylvania, who, of course, didn't say anything.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:37]** It wasn't really much of a conversation.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:41]** It was very one-sided, but she gave you everything.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** You know, she...

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** She's very, she has a lot of expressions.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:48]** You open the door and it's empty.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** The room is empty.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:52]** Kaniko steps in.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:57]** She just has her hands, like she doesn't have her hands on her, you know, her holster or anything.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** She peeks her head in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:00]** Orvear?

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** Are you in there?

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:06]** Here's to a scan for any bugs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** Way ahead of you.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** He's using... Yeah, he's doing that right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:20]** You will need to... Yeah, you'll need to give me, I believe, a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:23]** A perception check.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:26]** I was kind of hoping it would be computers engineering, but that's 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:28]** Okay.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** You can't tell.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** You don't think there is anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** I don't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Is the bed made?

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:39]** Like, does it seem like Orvir was intending to leave or like he was taken?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** His stuff is still there.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:48]** The bed is, is, is like not, well, actually I'll say this.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:54]** The bed is made, but it seems like it was made and he still has, you know, like a bag there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:55 - 00:28:00]** Since Kaniko entered first, Rick is going to step past here's and into the room.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:02]** If I can, I can't move.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:02]** I was locked.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:04]** There you go.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Let me unpause.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** You're good to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:09]** And as he steps in the room, he he'll run a perception.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:15]** That is a 16, so worse than here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:16]** Yeah.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** You don't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:22]** But he's going to act nonchalant as if he's following Kuniko's lead.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** Is there anything else with that perception that he notices?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** Everything looks fine and normal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:29]** Yeah.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** What do you guys got to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** I don't see anything else in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:38]** She's like, this looks like his stuff.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:42]** Is there a computer in there that he has some logs on, perhaps?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** Let me go look.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:50]** Pulls out just kind of a data pad, like, you know, iPad-like thing.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** Pulls it up.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:56]** She does... I don't think she has a computer.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:56]** Check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** God, I literally have to do everything.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** All right, hand it over to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Okay, she hands it over to you.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:02]** Here you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:30]** gotta be cool oh i didn't quite make it through i feel um well it's 14 there are administrative records on each of the paratons that's about all that you see there's administrative records on each of the paratons do i see any password protected areas encrypted areas nothing no okay it seems kind of checks out

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** Hands it back to Kanika.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** Yeah.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** I mean, I think this is all there is.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:37]** Yeah.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** Dr. K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:54]** As they're rummaging through the room, Dr. Okay is going to instruct Bernice that if anyone interrupts them or comes into sight to start firing wildly just as a distraction.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:59]** Not at the people, but just to fake a malfunction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Okay.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:01]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:06]** What is Bernice's bluff check?

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:11]** So Rick's going to step back into the hall.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:14]** There's nothing there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:14]** Okay.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:14]** All right, you two.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:17]** I don't know about you, but I need to get back to something.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** I got to go talk to Shay.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** All right?

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** Shay?

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Minus two.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:25]** Be careful what you say on the comms audibly because I'm going to be in front of him.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:27]** All right, bye-bye.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:27]** Okay.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** Here's makes his way to the hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** Steps into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:31]** Kaniko.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** Yeah, she walks out.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** Shuts the door.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** Rick, I...

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** I don't know where he is.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:40]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:45]** Is there any indication that somebody has been in that room in the last 24 hours?

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:48]** Or is it pristine, like nobody's been in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** No, there's been somebody in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:50]** Okay.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:54]** I think with your perception check, you can tell that somebody's been in there.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:57]** I mean, didn't Carl talk to Orville yesterday?

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** Did he?

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** Or, yeah, he did.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:04]** I think it was yesterday when he was like, hey, this all seems fishy.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:06]** And Orville was like, no, it's fine.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:06]** It's fine.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** It's fine.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:07]** Trust the process.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:09]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:13]** So Rick kind of confused shrugs it off and walks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Okay.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Hey, Bernice, stand down.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** She shoots wildly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** There you are, Bernice.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:26]** Oh, God.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:29]** Let's cut over to here's.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Here's.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** You walk in.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:34]** You're reminded when you walk in.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:41]** There's probably a bit of apprehension as you open that door because you realize that you see the tables laid out.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:43]** I believe I have them laid out here.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:46]** If you look in the bottom South corner, you can see gray tables laid out.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:53]** Um, not gray tables, but just like gray looking tables, uh, that are laid out.

**[00:31:54 - 00:32:03]** That are, that are laid out along the Southern wall there.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:11]** And Shay is just kind of walking, looking at his iPad, his data pad.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:13]** And you're reminded of just how big.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** Hey.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:20]** real quick here is as you walk in here, you're reminded just how large this hangar is.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** The void crier is there.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:25]** And on the map, the void crier, you know, is what, what is that?

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:29]** That's probably close to 200 feet of just the port.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** That is the docking bay.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:36]** And just, you can just barely see on the other side, the wing tip of the Sangeval ship.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** That is the Periton.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** And that's the other, you know, like 200 feet.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:42]** So this is a huge space.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:43]** Um,

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:13]** What's up, Shay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:16]** Yeah, cool.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:19]** Okay, so... What did I tell you earlier?

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** We talked about the armor.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Told you that there's some armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** Some other requests that we made as a group.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:28]** That's right.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:31]** We figured it would be helpful for us to have those things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:33]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:37]** Did you send those in my...

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:39]** Did you send those in my private Discord DM?

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** Because I don't see them.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:44]** Or was that just in our chat thread?

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:45]** Did you send them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** Yeah.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:49]** What Discord?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** What are you talking about?

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** I don't see them in me.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** Dot com?

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** I don't see what they are.

**[00:33:55 - 00:34:01]** So if you do want to send anything, then you should send me, John, the GM.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** Not right now.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:07]** Yeah, we took dose of it.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:07]** Okay, cool.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** Good, good, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** I sent you a DM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:13]** Yeah, what's up?

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:16]** A little bit of a good news, bad news situation here.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:17]** All right?

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:18]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:21]** Okay, story of my life with everything here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** I'm sorry.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:24]** Hey, you know, I'm doing my best.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** There's some... Clearly, there's some red tape.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:33]** You know, there's always the slow-turning gears of the stewards' bureaucracy, right?

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:37]** We're a pretty impressive group when we get around to it, right?

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** Okay, so look.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:39]** You're right.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** All right, so...

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:46]** Armor this request of weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** Let me see what I can do there.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:48]** It's not a problem.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** Well, I do appreciate it.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** Is this what you called me over for?

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:56]** You're getting as antsy as me.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** Sorry.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** I didn't mean to pass it on to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:04]** No, I mean, just like you, I'm sure that, uh, I'm sure that, yeah, you're a little anxious.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:09]** He, he's like, he takes a moment and he, and he puts a data.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Everything we've been through.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:10]** Am I right?

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** Yeah.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:11]** Right.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** Yeah.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** Yeah.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Am I right?

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:13]** Yeah.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** Okay.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** He puts his data pad in his pocket.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:15]** All right.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:19]** Look, word from up top.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** Rose light.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:24]** Uh, like I said, a bit of a good news, bad news situation.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** Good news.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:27]** Uh,

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:43]** uh rick 19 calling to them they're gonna they're gonna get a chance to go to rose light right um dr okay and yourself uh

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:48]** Dr. Nodens has some more questions for you, and there are just some concerns.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:56]** So I wanted to come to you personally and just let you know that's what's up, because you and I have been in communication a lot.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** You know, we've talked about the puck, right?

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:00]** So...

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:04]** Just wanted to let you know that, that they're going to be cleared to go.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** You won't be long behind.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** The plan is just one more day.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:10]** There's just one more set of questions.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** Probably just tomorrow morning.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** You know, we've got the party this afternoon.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** There's already a lot going on.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:25]** So my thought is they'll probably go tonight after the party, and then you'll be on the next one out.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:32]** We'll probably have the Void Crier take them, and then I think the Peritons can go tomorrow.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:35]** And after your questions, then...

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:37]** You and Dr. Okay can join them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:42]** Okay, so explain to me what the concerns were, if you know that.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:43]** I don't.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:51]** I was just trying to pass along what I... Is Dr. Nodens basically run things around here?

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:51]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:53]** Who's in charge of this station?

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:56]** It's that tall, lanky, scary guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** Inspector Hurt.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** Inspector Hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** Yeah, right.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:01]** Now, who has more pull here?

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:03]** Is it you or Dr. Nodens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:07]** Look, here's, I wish I could get into it with you.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:12]** Just trying to pass along what I got going here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** That's it.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** Yeah, I appreciate the heads up.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:18]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** But we're breaking out tonight, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:27]** Yeah, we're totally going to stick around and absolutely just go with the flow, right?

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:28]** Good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:29]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:33]** Are you actually saying that in the sense that you're trying to bluff him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:33]** No.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** No, no, no.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:36]** Okay.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** Just trying to check.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** Look, I... Was there anything else?

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** Yeah.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Yeah, Shane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:45]** No, I just... I wanted to break that news to you personally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:48]** Just so you... Yeah, it's bad news.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:51]** Okay, so the good news is that half of us are going and the bad news is half of us are staying.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** That's what you're saying.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:52]** Right.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** Not right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** Look, they're going to get to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:58]** Why can't they just wait for us to be finished with the interviews before they go?

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** Why do they have to go ahead?

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** I mean, they can.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** We're a party.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:02]** You know what I mean?

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Hey, you know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:07]** If you really want to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:32]** sure there's no reason that you couldn't but uh okay yeah but i think they are they do want them to to get going and then you guys can just well they okay well i remind you uh shay that we are not under suspicion for anything and we're not detained or anything right so like we don't have to do anything am i being detained am i being detained shay he looks around he's like

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:37]** No, you're not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** You know, look, you're not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:41]** I've been accused of a crime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:49]** I'm telling you that you and Dr. OK have one more round of questions.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:55]** But Rick and Colin, free to go to roast light.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:58]** Should be good to go from there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** I will get back to you about the armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** They'll probably go later on after the party.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:06]** I will get back to you about the armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:09]** What's our interview with Nodin supposed to be?

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** I don't know.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:13]** Silverton will probably reach out to you.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Silverton's super nice.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** Silverton.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** No, he's not.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:19]** He's an idiot.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** Silverton makes me ashamed.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:23]** He's my Sheeran brother and he let me down like you have no idea.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** Any news on my antenna?

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** No, I didn't think so.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:27]** I didn't think so.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** I'm just going to jump ahead and assume no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:31]** Why are you asking me?

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:33]** You should probably ask Silverton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:36]** Yeah, Silverton, my useless friend and brother.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:38]** But actually... Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:42]** He just flips a table and walks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:42]** Yeah, hold on, hold on.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:44]** Do you have the antenna that you lost?

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** Because we could put it, right?

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:54]** Because we could get another one and put it in the replicator, and then you can have two, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:58]** Oh, how I wish I could use that replicator.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** I don't think I have it, unfortunately.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** I don't know where it is.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** I think the greys took it, Shay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:08]** I love that he's effectively pitching, like, clip your remaining one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:11]** Yeah, so could we just clip the other one, and then we can get two?

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** Goodbye, Shay.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:15]** And then Silverton can... You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:30]** here's i'll see you later yeah yeah bye shay and he walks away thank you and then rick rick comes on the comms is like well that that sucks for you too uh but colin and i i think we're gonna take this opportunity and go


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:36]** Are you for real saying that right now, Rick?

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:39]** You're just messing around, right?

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** I was kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** It's time to get out, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:47]** So wait, what's the news?

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** We're getting out of here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:49 - 00:41:01]** Okay, so guys, if you happen to overhear that, I can't remember if I had open comms on or whatever, but Shay said that you, Rick, and Colin were free to go to Roselight.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:14]** uh, today after the party and that you doctor and I had to stay for another round of questioning with Dr. Nodens, uh, which, yeah, he, we're not, we're not being detained.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:18]** And I, I know that I have a right to know if there are any charges against me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:19]** Yeah, we do.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:22]** So let's just stick to the plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:28]** And I have a right to legal representation for further questioning two doctors and no lawyers on this crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** Can you cause a lawyer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** Of course she is.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** Wait, really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:34]** Yeah.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:34]** Really?

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** Anything she needs us to be.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** Well, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** No, but she's actually a lawyer.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:43]** There should be protections against unlawful detention as well, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:53]** Awfully bold to assume that intergalactic law is the same as American law.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Yeah, it's true.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:55]** It's true.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:58]** Honestly, though, Rick is like, we are not.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** I do not intend to leave without you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** I do appreciate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:08]** During Operation... That word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:12]** Just for the listeners, they're all standing in the middle of the hallway again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:17]** The camera.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:18]** The speaker.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** There's actually a dangling microphone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:28]** We're having this incredibly private conversation just like in front of God and everybody on this base.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** We're so clever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:35]** Let's get to our rooms.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:37]** Wait, this is not the right hallway.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:40]** We're great at espionage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:40]** We're so good.


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:42]** Ugh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:46]** Back to their room.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:48]** We do all the espionage.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:48]** All right.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:51]** So that it's private.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** John just moved Sylvania.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** There's nobody at the gate running for it.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** They can run for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:19]** wordlessly runs away wordlessly all right so we have this conversation in private what what's the what's the conversation


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:45]** uh everything we just said happened and we're just retconning a little bit because we're dumb and have conversations in hallways instead of bedrooms yeah that's fine that's fine that's okay no worries okay as i was saying operation mutiny is still a go he says loud enough to hear it through the door right right we have to we have to close the door first god


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:52]** So this is the one that's bugged, but we're going to put it on a loop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:57]** I'm sure you would do a check and you'd know how to turn it off whenever we go in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:58]** Yeah.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** Instead, it plays Spanish.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:02]** I would not put that below Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** O.K.'s.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:06]** I mean, I'm sure I have to do a computer's check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:07]** Yeah.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** Well, what are you trying to do, Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:11]** O.K.?

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** Disable the recording for a moment.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** Just have it be static for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** In his room.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** Just in the room that we're in.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** Okay, got it.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** Okay, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:28]** I'm assuming I can just reuse the hack that I installed previously to do the loop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** Yeah, that's not a problem.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** Not a problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:54]** uh here's you're not in the room you're standing outside the room is that right yeah he was just taking a smoke break okay in the hallway in the hallway where you can't smoke yeah okay yeah that's right because he he doesn't play by the rules all right he's a badass okay he's a bad boy okay yeah he's bad yeah oh there's kanika around the corner


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:54 - 00:45:15]** uh okay so hey sorry i just haven't moved since i was talking to you all right um okay so i check out sometimes what do you all want to do for the next it's around 9 9 15 you have about seven hours again i'm gonna ask one more time is there anything that you guys want to do sorry if that was a mistake uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:21]** So Rick is definitely frustrated about everything and he knows he has time to waste and he knows he can't go into the restricted area.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:29]** So I think the only option he has is that he's going to kind of just go pace the hangar and nonchalantly, nothing suspicious.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:32]** He's just kind of like looking for a space to walk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** Okay.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:54]** so i'll move rick out of the hallway and he'll let everybody else go or know that i'm even paused again sorry yep go ahead uh so he after our deep and engaged conversation rick's gonna be like i'm i'm gonna go take a walk around the hangar okay and he kind of just leaves okay so rick's walking thinking anybody else


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:55]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:58]** is trying to brush up on his constitutional law.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** So he can make a case.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Okay.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:03]** I like it.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:11]** Colin, seeing another sleepless night ahead of him, lays down on his rack to at least try to get some rest.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:20]** And he dreams off to visions of him and Kaniko getting that drink on a beach somewhere under an umbrella.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:39]** it's cute yeah i like the comms you hear rick say this hangar suspiciously stops halfway through it that is beyond the scope of this adventure uh it might be the other hangar we're looking for


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:42 - 00:47:08]** every time here's his sleeping or he's he has his eyes open he goes to bed he has his eyes open and just like colin he's just imagining like colin and kaniko you know like sitting on a beach or whatever he said but like having a nice like date and he smiles to himself that was history being a third wheel that was history to be clear that was here's his dream his dream about colin and kaniko


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:15]** This is the life of a wingman.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** This is the life of a wingman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:17]** Okay.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** All right.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** Good times.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:19]** Good times.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** Well, time begins to pass.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:31]** You all are spending the rest of the morning sleeping, regenerating, getting rejuvenated.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:34]** I'm moving the clock forward now by 15 minutes.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** Let's stop at...

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:38]** 3.30?

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:39]** 15.30?

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:45]** It's about 30 minutes until the time of the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:47]** I don't see any tables in the hangar.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** What are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:48]** Uh, they are here.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** I'm pinging them on the map.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:50]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** That's like a buffet table.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:56]** I thought you meant you had like seats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** Banquet table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** Circular tables.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** They're fancy.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** Come on now.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** It's a standing room only.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** It's not an olive garden.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Okay, come on.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** So, uh...

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** So, it's about 3.30.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:10]** We're not family.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** Oh, we are family, though.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:16]** What do you all want to do?

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:22]** In this last few moments, before it starts, where are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:27]** Rick joins them again, I'm assuming, in the rooms.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:30]** We get decked out in our nicest armor.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Of course.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:37]** And he locks and loads and makes sure everything is filled.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:39]** Okay.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:42]** And then he's going to convene with Dr. O.K.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** and Colin in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** You all get together?


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** Yep, here's follows.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** Okay.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:51]** Everybody looks real sharp, especially you, Colin.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** This is going to be a good day for you.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** I can feel it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** Aye.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:58]** It's too long to wait.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:02]** I'm ready to get going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:02]** Yeah.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:11]** Yeah, I'd like to blow this popsicle stand before having to endure another boorish meeting with that fiendish doctor.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Aye.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:20]** I mean, she looks like Cruella de Vil, who I don't know, but I understand it's a reference from somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:22]** Some pre-gap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** She does look like Cruella de Vil.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** Yeah.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:26]** Yeah.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:47]** well yeah okay i i guess like uh all right so remember guys uh we got the plan i think uh who colin are you really gonna try to are you really gonna try to unlock the hangar doors or can we just say you did because you know it's not really your forte right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** No, no, it's not mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:54]** It is yours, though, isn't it?

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** It is mine, and I feel like Dr. O.K.

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:00]** and Bernice should come with me just in case, as backup and to help me with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:06]** I think the four of us should go together during this Operation Mutiny.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** The Peritons are off on their own.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:08]** They will be on their ship.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:13]** We should stick together, infiltrate the restricted zone, and get to those cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** We may need a distraction there.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:22]** I would find it surprising if there was no one stationed in the restricted zone, even during this celebration.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** We might have to take them out.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** Non-lethally, of course.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Yeah, of course, Rick.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** Yeah, wink.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:31]** And then, like, I also have invisibility, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:33]** Dead men tell no tales.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:47]** unconscious ones tell no tales until they wake up and we'll be gone by then I feel like Rick is rubbing off on everyone in a bad way but I'm ready I'm ready

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:49]** Okay.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:53]** Yeah, I think we're all on the same page.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:57]** I guess, yeah.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** We're good to go.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:59]** What was the code word again for Kaniko?

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** Something Akiton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:05]** We're going to talk about terraforming Akiton.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** How their game went last night.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:09]** Brilliant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** Is there anything else that we're forgetting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:15]** I just think it's really funny that we're all like, eh, fuck it, kill him.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:19]** And Rick19's like, pump the brakes.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** Whoa.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** Whoa, sir.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** This is a Wendy's.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** Sir.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** This is a steward's base, sir.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** Is it though?

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** Everyone focus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:32]** Right?

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Yeah, true.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:43]** I have some amount of piloting experience for these vehicles out there in the hangar.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** I can pilot one.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:44]** Okay.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:46]** Who else is a good pilot?

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** Okay, cool.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** Dr. No Can I will be driving.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:56]** I've got some piloting skills as well.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** Okay, great.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** There's three vehicles, so that's perfect.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** All right, so the three of us.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** Is that agreeable to you, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:04]** I mean, I could pilot if I had to.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:08]** On a scale of 1 to 20, I have a plus 4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:11]** All right, Rick, that ain't bad.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:15]** So we're going to be good, but we'll let you sit in the back and have fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** John's like, you guys are never going to make it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Look at his face.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:21]** Look at his face.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** He just stands up like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** This is so fun.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** This is just so neat.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:31]** You all are about to execute a f***ing mission to break out of the steward's base.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** That's what's coming out of Jon's mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:42]** We're about to execute a heist in which the heisties or the heist subjects all know of our plan.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:55]** This adventure path is literally written like, yeah, they have to split up for 12 hours while these guys get questioned and then they all get to go or they could kill everyone.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** One of those two things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:03]** John's internal dialogue is this is the worst escape I've ever heard in my life.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** Let's see how it goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:17]** i'm just can you go help help yeah make this plan so john's equally as guilty he's the mastermind of this heist he's like you played all into my trap as long as you're having fun i'm having fun so that's that's what matters


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** Let's blow this popsicle stand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** Let's blow this popsicle stand.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:27]** Keniko sends you a text and says, hey, we're all heading out there right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** So the dinner is in the banquet?

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:33]** Or the banquet is in the hangar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:38]** Everyone, let's make an appearance for like 10 minutes and then bounce, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:42]** Yeah, did you decide how long you're going to be there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** I thought it was 30.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** Okay, 30 minutes.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:44]** Or maybe 20.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** We should stagger our exits.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** Yeah, let's stagger it from 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** And we loop the video.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** The video is on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Okay.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:52]** All right.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** Operation Mutiny.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:55]** Let's go.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** You all walk in.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:00]** I know.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:04]** You all can change this.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Can't change it now.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:06]** Can't change it now.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** It's canon.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:15]** You all walk in and everyone is there.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:22]** I unpause the game and you all are free to start walking into the hangar.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:30]** As you come in, you notice that there are just a lot of, one, a lot of stewards there.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** A bunch of stewards.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:36]** All the Peritons are talking.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:39]** And there's a strange music playing over the speakers.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** Someone give me a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** I'll do a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** Colin is pretty cultured.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:54]** The room itself has a certain vibe to it that feels like something's changed, but you're not sure what.

**[00:54:54 - 00:55:00]** There are tables laid along the southern wall that have a bunch of tasty-looking food on it.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:03]** People seem to be merry.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:08]** The tension that you felt in the cafeteria, the Peritons must be pretty...

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:24]** relax at least for the moment they're like maybe as you walk by they kind of give you an eye and you feel like it's one of those knowing kind of eyes you know and like they're like yep good to see you here we're you know we'd see you but everyone seems to be talking having a good time dr okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** Some of them are workers, right?

**[01:02:55 - 01:03:12]** So I didn't put it on their badge here, but you're able to see which of them are a bit higher rank and which one of them are kind of more like the blue collar stewards workers who are stewards, but here working in a different capacity than being in like a leadership admin role.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:23]** But you do have... I forget what the marker thing is called, but the peritons have the circle with the three triangles, and they also have the weird butterfly wings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:31]** Yeah, so if you zoom into that symbol, it is a stag's head with wings, which is the technical name.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:33]** That's the beast, a periton.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:36]** If you Google a periton, it is a stag with wings.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** That's where their names come from.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:42]** And the three triangle...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:56]** token is just to indicate that they're peritons right and then but the other ones have uh stewards an octagon with the stewards uh shield and wings right exactly yeah yeah exactly


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:59]** So you all are hanging out, talking.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:03]** I imagine you guys are talking to some people, having a good time.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:04]** Things are fun.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:14]** And then there's a moment where things kind of just... Like the music shuts down for a second and the door opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:34]** He steps in.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:36]** He steps in kind of here to the center.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:45]** As he steps in and all the attention is drawn to Inspector Heard, Colin is going to make his exit down the hallway.


## Speaker_0

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:46]** Hmm.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:53]** He's trying to do it without people noticing, yeah.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:55]** He's just trying to quietly excuse himself.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:57]** He does sort of that waddle.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:16]** In the middle.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:18]** Oh, he just orders all the way to the middle.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:20]** People, like, make space for him.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:21]** Hey, can I pour you a drink?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:23]** That's a 15 for Collins.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:27]** He's also going to make his way out of here at this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:31]** Yeah.
