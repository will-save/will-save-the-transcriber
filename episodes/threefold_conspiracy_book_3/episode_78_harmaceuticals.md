## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:22]** Previously on Will Save... Our boisterous brand of brigands, befuddled by the bluster before battle, bumptiously blunder their surprise before the bombastic bonanza, bringing forth a booming blast to bombard Rick, who's received an unrolled amount of ruin from Aeol's supercharged squad machine gun.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:29]** Will the blast from these bewitched belligerents be bypassed before brutally befouling our bosom buddies?

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:41]** Or will our band of brothers bickering bar them from breaking free from the banality of this beastly betrayal and banish them into a bleak and bitter blackness aboard the Void Crier?

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:46]** Find out this time on Will Save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** Hello and welcome.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:39]** Please come in, take a seat, join us, because we'll save the royal table.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:46]** I am your Viscount, John Swan, and I'm here with our royal illustrious cast.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:51]** Of course, I will not steal your thunder, your moment.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** Please introduce yourselves.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:57]** Starting with my esteemed equal, Sir Gilliam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Hello.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** I am the Earl Gilliam.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:04]** Just a few ranks up in the peerage above our wonderful Viscount here.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:08]** But I do love coming to his cute little bungalow here in the countryside.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:13]** Enjoying a coffee with my good friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** And it looks like we have some new guests.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:15]** Oh, we do.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** Good morning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:21]** My name is Lord Decker of the Evermost.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:26]** And I'm gracious to be invited to such a fine event.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:30]** You see, Earl, the Evermost is quite far.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:33]** It's an island quite far, remote off the coast.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** You came from very far indeed.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** And I rode all the way by horse.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:40]** That's even across the water.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Seahorse, mind you.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:44]** You rode a seahorse on the land?

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** Because I'm from an island.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** Oh, wow.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** That's quite incredible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** We grow them quite large there.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:58]** They're within six feet to ten feet long, and they can definitely support a man's weight above water.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** It's impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:03]** Especially a man of your stature, I don't think would have any trouble.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** It's good to see you.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** I know, that's what I'm saying.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** So any seahorse will do.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:12]** Any seahorse, perhaps.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:17]** One might say you could play a wolverine in a movie, perhaps.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:19]** What is this wolverine that you speak of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:21]** It's a tiny, rabid creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:25]** I have to say, I forgot when... With an infectious passion.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** When are we... Infectious passion.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** Our gracious host, could you tell us what year is it?

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** Because I don't know.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:32]** Oh, well, it is... What year is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:35]** It is the year of our king, 1799.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** 1799.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** That's right.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** How could I forget?

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** Yes, of course.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** How could I forget?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** Oh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** Hello.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Well, who else do we have coming in right now?

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:46]** Oh, someone's swapping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Yes, hello.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:55]** This is the Elder Earl of Scottsdale.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** Sorry.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** The Elder Rodriguez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** And pray tell, where is Scottsdale?

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** Scottsdale?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:04]** Oh, that's just over the Glen over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:06]** Scottsdale.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** Glen Scottsdale, as they say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Glen Scottsdale, yeah.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** Scottsdale.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Am I getting that right?

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:16]** Not to be confused with Clarence Scottsdale or Locke Scottsdale.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** This is Glen Scottsdale.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** And not with Sandlin Phoenix.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** It's not the same at all, no.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Correct.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** Correct.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:24]** No, they're nearby.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:27]** It's quite dry where I'm from.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** So no seahorses?

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:31]** Oh, no, no.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:34]** A few camels, but no seahorses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:39]** Oh, is that Sir Garrett?

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:39]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:40]** Yes.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** Is that just coming in?

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:41]** Yes.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** Oh, hello, Sir Garrett.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** Sir Garrett.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:48]** How was your journey from wherever you... Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:04:49 - 00:05:08]** Yes, I traveled with the Earl of Sandwich earlier, and I've traveled quite far to come here, but it's quite a pleasant countryside, and I am inspired by your passion for this endeavor you've been on, especially you riding a seahorse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** Oh, yes.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:13]** That's high praise from Mr. Garrett.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:15]** Lord Garrett is an esteemed adventurer.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:21]** The king himself rewarded him, I think, with the badge of adventuring, I think is what it was.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:23]** It's been added to his coat of arms.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:23]** Ages ago.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** That was it.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** The badge of adventuring.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** The badge of adventuring, yes.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** And it's been added to his carton and all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** Yes, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:34]** It's the second highest, actually.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** Fantastic.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:35]** Fantastic.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** Right under the one that I got from him, did you?

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:43]** I forgot that you actually got the super badge of inventory.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:45]** The badge of heroism extraordinaire, yes.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** Also, yes, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:49]** Sorry, I thought it was just the badge of settling.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** Shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:51]** Good lord, what do you know?

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:53]** You're from some random island hovel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** It's what I got on the raven that came to us.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:57]** There was a raven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** I thought that there would just be a seahorse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** That's what they do over there on the island.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** No, ravens are used for messages.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:04]** Seahorses are used for us to ride.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** How cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Oh, yes, I see, I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** How quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** We build ships in my country.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** We live on an island.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:17]** We actually have post people, but I love the idea of a raisin carrying the stuff around.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** It must be very fun.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:20]** Do you feed it?

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** Does it eat biscuits?

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:26]** I don't keep them myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** They deliver messages and that's about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Yes.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** Quite curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:39]** Now, this has been the most pleasant, pleasant banter, I have to say.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:41]** Quite refreshing.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** Rejuvenating of the spirit.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:47]** But I think it might be time to get to our first task of business.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:48]** I'm sorry.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** Could you remind me what that was?

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** I forgot.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:57]** I think maybe the raven might have eaten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:04]** I believe the term you're looking for is let's play.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** Let's play.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** All right.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:10]** And remind me again of the game that we're playing.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:12]** I believe it is called...

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** Bridge.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:14]** Oh, bridge.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:15]** Yes.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:17]** I thought it was Star Chart Finders.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:18]** Which was it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** I thought it was Bocce Ball.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:20]** Bocce?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** Star Chart Finders.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** Bocce Ball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:24]** Oh, come on now.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:25]** You're not high enough.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** Come on.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:29]** It's a very respectable game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** Oh, goodness.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:31]** Yes.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:36]** I suppose if you're in your 60s and withering away in your castle on your hill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:41]** I thought we were going to enjoy a bit of bladder football.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:43]** Oh, bladder football might be nice.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** Could we start with a little star chart finder?

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:51]** I believe I have had some charts brought in.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:55]** And I believe we can play the finder.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:55]** Yes.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** Does that sound good?

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:00]** That sounds smashing, which is a word that isn't used yet in this language.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** What's up, what's up?

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** Let's play some Starfighter!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** Hi, everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** We committed to that.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** We tried.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** We didn't know how far to go.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:12]** We didn't know how far to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:14]** So, like, take one, we went entirely too far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** Too far.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** We'll release that on exclusive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** Maybe.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** That might just be for us.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** We'll see.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** That might just be for us.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** You know, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** It's okay.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:34]** I looked up while we were doing that British games from the 1800s, including bladder football.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:37]** That's where you got bladder football?

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:39]** Apparently cockfighting was very popular.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** But there were no chickens involved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:44]** Also known as cocking.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** Is that where the term cockabout comes from?

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** I'm sure it was.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** Who says cockabout?

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** British people.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:53]** Do they?

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:59]** British people will chime in on Discord and tell us, but you can't say cockabout.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:01]** I'm afraid of Google cocking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** Known as a cockpit.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** Is that going to be Benny's third blue link?

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** I googled that shit.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:15]** Talk about wasting time doing something pointless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:19]** Yeah, I thought that was adjacent to wanker.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** Wanker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** That's a different thing.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:26]** To wank about might be to be a general like Belland or something like that.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:29]** Belland, eh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** I can't believe you suggested bocce.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** What a stupid game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** I was going to go with croquet.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** Croquet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** That is a sport.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:39]** With 60-year-olds, it's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:41]** I was going to throw in Brutaris.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** That would be awesome.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** All right, take three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Let's do it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:50]** We should engage in a game of Brutaris.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** Our British accents will get there someday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:53]** Take five will be perfect.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:56]** We'll hire an accent coach one day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:59]** We just go the rehearsal list.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** We all move to the UK.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:06]** We start lives as royals and then re-record this in a year's time.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** We'll save the UK.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** We could have headquarters there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:15]** At John's wedding, we're just going to spend the entire weekend talking and scouting for properties.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:18]** We're checking off the first three items in like three weeks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** They'll love us there.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:24]** I mean, they're Scots.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** They'll probably like it.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:30]** Yeah, I don't think they will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:34]** Maybe we just start playing before we keep talking.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:39]** There was a warning in the invitation that was like, alcohol is higher here.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:44]** Alcohol is stronger.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** It's actually in there somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** Really?

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:47]** I don't know.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** I didn't write the email.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:53]** He has people do that for him.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:56]** He is, after all, the Viscount of Whereverville.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** Yeah, is Earl higher than Viscount?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** It is.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** I think it's like Duke Earl than Marquis.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Marquis.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:07]** But you are a very respected Viscount, I have to say.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** And you're a great host.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** Very gracious host.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:10]** So it doesn't matter.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** We love you anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:17]** We love you while looking down upon you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:17]** All right.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** Have fun playing Bocce.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** Let's play.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:28]** So last time aboard the Voidcrier was also quite a hoot.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:36]** As you all were searching about in your quest to, let's see, maybe quell.

**[00:11:36 - 00:12:01]** The action that's on board from the aggression as the Pikes Peritons, the mercenaries that are contracted by the stewards, have gone aggressive with some sort of programming, presumably by the greys that took 24 hours of your lives, experimented on you, and put you back.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:07]** Now, you are in the process of fighting these Pyke's Paratons.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** And you have taken out five of them.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** They are unconscious, non-lethal.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:26]** Which Kaniko Breeze, who you saved, the only other individual besides the four of you, who has not succumbed to this programming or in any other way been incapacitated as these stewards so far have.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** Shay and Narla.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:30]** And there are four left that are unaccounted for.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** Sorry, let me take a drink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** Yeah, you said three, but you forgot the leader of the Pykes.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** Yeah, you still haven't found Orvir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:42]** So Orvir, Hesper.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:45]** Hesper, which is where I got the idea for it.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:47]** Nasally, what's his accent?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:52]** Eol and Urgot, the half-orc.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** Phrasma, devotee.

**[00:12:55 - 00:13:00]** And you're with Kaniko, and you're like, yo, let's bump around, let's bop around, try and find these folks.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:08]** And then, lo and behold, bing, bing, bing, the elevator opens as Orgott and Hesper and Ale step out, being like, yo, where are those traitors at?

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** I want to attack them.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** So, what do you all do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Everything at once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:17]** Rick19 decides to go down the hall.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:21]** Here's the situation.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:24]** Fabricius decides to step out into the hall.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:26]** Colin Edenbrand also steps out of the hall.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:29]** Dr. O'Kane notably decides to take a smart choice and just hide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** Thank you, Dr. O'Kane.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** Pretty smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** Yeah.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:37]** And as that all happens, they, of course, in your surprise round, you get ready.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** Kaniko says, I'm going to support you.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** Pistol out.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** Ready to go.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:43]** They are your ally here.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:47]** And we get into some combat.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:54]** In that first round, I think we made it only through one round last time because it was a lot of moving parts.

**[00:13:55 - 00:14:01]** You all are in one corridor aboard the Void Crier, a single file corridor with three doors along it.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** And they are in the open area.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:08]** And it's a tactics and nightmare.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** Could swing either way very easily.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** The pendulum could go both ways.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:28]** Now, right as we ended was when I believe Bernice made some distractions in order to call attention to the fact that right now the three aggressors can only see Rick 19.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:38]** Bernice hit Meltaman trying to pull attention down the hall, pull it away from Colin, Hears, and Dr. O'Kay who are in the rooms.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:46]** Now, Aeol steps up with their squad machine gun, supercharged by Hesper.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:52]** Hits Rick19 with a supercharged shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:55]** Six points of damage, so let me take that six points off and call it a day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** Yeah, no, definitely, for sure.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** Good, for sure.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** Yeah, super easy.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:05]** Now, I roll a d8 for that weapon, plus some number.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:11]** And I already got that last time, so that dice that you might have just heard roll was just me throwing the dice down.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:16]** But these four D6 that I'm holding up, these are going to be the supercharged weapon here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:21]** I just want to point out, Kelly, that I'm glad I didn't just move out of the way.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** Because you'd probably be dead.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** Are you?

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** I'm taking this damage for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:28]** Are y'all seeing this on the map?

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:31]** It's a very nice thing for you to do.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** I feel bad.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:34]** But thanks for being a tank and everything.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:37]** We're going to try to help you out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:41]** Yeah, I just loaded y'all into the Voidcry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:41 - 00:16:03]** From Colin's perspective, and I kind of hate this because he tried to sneak out and just trucked Rick 19 into the wall and gave up the element of surprise right away and is now posted up watching Rick take this supercharged shot right to whatever body part gets it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:09]** It is, Rick19 is sitting right in front of the door that Colony and Brain is at.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:11]** Yeah.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:14]** And I, what is going on in Rick19's mind?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:28]** I mean, he is frantic to, like, he's telling everybody to move out of the way, and he's kind of irritated by the fact that, like, he shouldn't be standing here taking this hit, but he's ready to take it, is his thought.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** He sees the charger out, and, yeah.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** It is what it is.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** He's... I just rolled.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** Apathetic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** Apathetic.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Good word.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** Okay.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:44]** That is going to be... Okay.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:48]** 18 points of bludgeoning and electric damage.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** I rolled two ones.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:52]** There.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:56]** 18 points of damage to you.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:56]** So it could have been way worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:06]** As that energy is coming towards Rick, it hits him, but you almost see a part of him phase out.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:21]** or change like it almost like divide a little bit and then recombine so it's only actually gonna take 15 points of damage what the fuck what are you is it your android like re-healing abilities or something regenerative abilities

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:23]** I'm just going to say I lied to you guys earlier.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** I'll leave it like that.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** It's mostly for the fans.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:30]** I feel like you guys might know more than the players.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:40]** As this is happening, maybe Colin, you can see it more because the shots from Ayo's gun is just like...

**[00:17:40 - 00:18:06]** every other shot is like a tracer fire that clearly is meant to like draw attention to ale as a fighter they are trying to pull aggro for lack of a better term uh towards them trying to pull all of their attention and that is ale's turn this human who is otherwise maybe a little quiet and meek and just when they're in combat especially now smiling crazed


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:22]** shooting at rick 19 that's the turn the situation what are you doing on your turn here okay so the situation is wondering because when they came down the guy was like let me get these traitors he could have been talking about his compatriots or what he thought is his former compatriots

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:28]** I don't know, but I'm just saying because I don't remember the other ones being that lucid when they transformed or whatever mentally.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** However, I could be wrong.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:35]** So here's his going to with his mind link, like tell everyone.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:45]** Now, before I do this, Jimmy T, who's on Discord, but I think it might have been during our Twitch stream, was like, yeah, here's now that you're like...

**[00:18:45 - 00:19:08]** antennas a little clipped like you better speak like a lisp or something like that when you're doing that or like in honor of you sir yeah that's fine all right jimmy this is for you all right hey guys so this just sounds like snake boy i don't know anyway it's like it doesn't have to be a lisp it can be something else

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** It could be something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:11]** Hey, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:13]** It can't do it.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** It has to be something else.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:17]** I sound like I'm making fun of someone, and I'm going to get canceled.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:17]** Right, right, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** Can anyone else, like... No, no, no, it's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:20]** Think on it.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:22]** Some other thing has to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** We can figure it out later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** We'll come up with a compromise.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:30]** All right, so, like, here's this, like, you know, he mind links everyone, and he's like, hey, guys, so...

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:35]** I don't know, but whoever's really good at diplomacy, maybe just try talking to them.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:39]** We don't really know for sure if they turned, you know what I'm saying?

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:44]** I could be wrong, and I don't want anyone to take any more hits than they need to, but...

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:47]** You know, by, like, just talk to them.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** See if you can, like, you know, negotiate with them or something like that.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** I'm not a good negotiator.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:57]** But here's gonna... Rick probably has something in mind, maybe, hopefully.

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:03]** Like, so here's just gonna go, like, back into this room and just get ready to help Rick if need be.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** Okay.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** So what are you doing mechanically?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** You're just gonna ready your action or you're just waiting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:13]** I'm going to ready the action for if I come around the corner and that mother trucker is like there.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** In direct line of sight?

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:18]** Yeah, I'm going to like magic missile them.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** Okay.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:20]** I think that's fair.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:27]** Speaking of ready action, I forgot that Kaniko had a ready action to as soon as she could see one of them.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:33]** And here's you said that and Kaniko is like, I'll see what I can do.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:42]** And she is seeing Rick, because you probably got staggered, Rick, because you're getting shot down the hall, right?

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** Not mechanically.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** Not mechanically.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:48]** Play the lines.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** Oh, my God.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** I'm getting hit.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:49]** Yeah.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** Okay.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:57]** So you are getting hit, and Kaniko's first thought is to heal you.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:09]** And so she is going to, to you, Rick, is going to say, Rick, you need to watch out for Orgat.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:14]** Her spells might take you out, but stay in there.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** You can do this.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:21]** And you get 13 stamina points back from Inspiring Boost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** An envoy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** Is that correct?

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** What's up?

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** Is she an envoy?


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** And then she is going to say...

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:56]** al you don't have to do this you can just put your weapons down or got you can just put your weapons down and you hear or got say we're coming for you too now koniko all right whatever and i will move her in the turn order here's you took your turn and it is now going to be or got's turn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:59]** I don't have time to tell Meltaman to do something, right?

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** You do not.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** Damn it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Yeah.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** That is going to be moving this here on Foundry.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:09]** Meltaman, help.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:09]** Help?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:10]** Meltaman, help!

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** Well, he knows he's supposed to be helping Rick.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** That command is still in his head.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** So, he should be doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:18]** Yeah, I don't see Meltaman in the turn order.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** I've seen him in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:24]** Yeah, why hasn't he... You told Meltaman to attack...

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** The dwarf.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** Or no, the Vesk, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** Well, whatever.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** I'm pretty sure you told Meltaman to attack the Vesk.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:35]** I'm just saying if you want to do that again, you should tell them again that you want to attack.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:41]** Because that was my understanding was you said you should go attack this individual, that individual one, Tam.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** It is Orgat's turn.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:47]** Orgat's going to step up and Rick may be behind Eyal.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:54]** You can see Orgat reach out with her hand and just point all of her fingers at you.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** And I need you to give me a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** Will save!

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:02]** What'd you get?

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** 11.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** You got 11?

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:07]** That's what I said.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:17]** That's 12 more points of damage to you as mind thrust rocks your brain as just this impending sense of the void.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:20]** Maybe just every once in a while, you're like, wow, death.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:24]** That is something that comes through your mind occasionally.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:31]** But in that moment, the reality of death and what that means overwhelms your consciousness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:35]** Does a 13 still fail?

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:41]** yes okay just checking because i think constructed gives me a plus two towards mind effects


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** That's great.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** Also, I appreciate that deep cut fuel right there.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** That was good.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** That was a good application of fuel.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** That's 12 points of damage to you.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:50]** 12?

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:51]** Not 13.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** Not 13.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** I have 13 in my head because you put it there.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:55]** Psychic.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** Alright.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:59]** It is the top of round three.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** Colin, what are you doing?

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:02]** You're lying in wait.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:09]** You see Rick in front of you getting just shot at and then grabbing their head, grimacing, just in pain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** Um...

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:16]** I think I want to test out a new spell to me.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:19]** Something called Wisp Ally.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:30]** Colin's going to cast Wisp Ally on Rick19's location.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:36]** Basically, it's a small glowing sphere that can distract enemies.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:41]** It can move 60 feet in any direction, and I can direct it as a move action.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:50]** If it occupies the same space as an enemy, it provides my choice of either harrying or covering fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:54]** I'm not an enemy, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:54]** You're not.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** But I can't see the enemy.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** My Wisp ally probably can.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:06]** And so I'm going to cast it on Rick's location, which is within 25 feet because it's a close casting.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:12]** My Wisp can then move up to 60 feet toward... I'm going to... My...

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:19]** Little Wisp, go and give Rick some cover.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:22]** He needs it from the nearest enemy.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:31]** And so the Wisp is going to seek out whoever the closest enemy is, occupy their space, and provide covering fire for Rick 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:31 - 00:26:00]** it kind of freaks Rick out for a second because he's he just got shot and then he's got this mind thrust going on and then all of a sudden this little like spark goes right next to his head he's like what the and then it it flies off and he's like ah okay that must be one of ours yep what color is the wisp because that's cool uh it's red like Sarenrae's wings it's red like Sarenrae's wings that's cool that's super cool so this gave me gave herring fire or covering fire uh covering fire


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:25]** covering fire for cool so hang on let me double check my for rick core rule book here uh do do but the selected ally gains plus two circumstance bonus to ac it's the next attack from the creature yes covering fire for rick so i get it's and it's per as yeah against each for each round is what it says yeah basically first attack for each round first right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:42]** okay sweet yeah forever attacks you first covering fire cool i like it that's awesome flies out i put on foundry the swirling red light hopefully to indicate and that's going to be on whoever attacks you next right whoever attacks me next


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:47]** Quick clarifying point because the rules lawyers will have my head.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:51]** It is not whomever attacks you next.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:56]** It is based on my instructions whomever was closest to Rick19 at the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** So it will be Hesper.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** I can't see around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:32]** the one who shot you with the guns cool because the wisp is only on the one on whoever's closest so that it's whoever that attacks got it whomever's space the wisp is occupying got it that's cool that's rad aioli is the one aioli alright you want to do anything else with your turn after you cast this wisp from your bedside cabana okay alright rick19 what you doing

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:34]** You got a lot of help from your friends here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:46]** Yeah, I think, again, Rick is kind of, again, waving behind him, trying to get everybody in that hallway to move.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:53]** And he's going to target Aeoli with a non-lethal attack.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** Oh, God, I just threw my...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:59]** Oh, yeah, don't forget we got the non-lethal from Dr. OK and Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** Yeah, that's a nine to attack.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:06]** So he takes a shot and misses, and then he's going to step back.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:10]** He's going to step over Bernice, but Melt-A-Man is in his way.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:15]** So he's touching Melt-A-Man and telling him, like, get in the room.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** Get in the room.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:17]** All right.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** I will move.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:28]** Reluctantly and he's he's kind of like you should tell me all the man to fight Well, I guess something up his sleeve or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:42]** I don't know maybe Yeah, I thought that that's what that's what I was gonna tell you so I was gonna tell Milton man, too I was gonna have help them but man Hawking I guess that's my trick


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** That's your turn.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:50]** Got some communication going on here in this tight, tight situation.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** But it's not the situation's turn.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:52]** It's Dr.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** O.K.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:53]** 's turn.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:54]** Nope.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** It's tight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:56]** It's tight.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:58]** It's tight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** Thank you, John.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:05]** Dr. OK is still in concealment, but he's incognito.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:19]** He has the full control apparatus for Bernice, you know, rocking and rolling and being now, you know, next to Rick.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:42]** he's bernice is going to or dr okay is going to instruct bernice to fire uh covering fire and then move and try and draw them back further down the hallway by um can you go okay so i gotta roll for yeah you're you're trying to do so right now discover fire stack no i don't think it does


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:46]** So right now, Rick19 already has cover fire from Wisp ally, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** Yes.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:51]** From Wisp ally from that specific enemy.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:52]** Got it.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:55]** So he could have, in theory, covering fire from multiple enemies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** From a different enemy.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:56]** Yep.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Okay.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** That's fair.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:09]** So if you wanted to do that against Orgot, that would be probably soft cover, right?

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:11]** Because of AL being in the way.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:18]** But you could... So that would be AC-19 that you need to hit just to... Just your attack roll, your raised attack roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** Yeah, I can't... I have to basically get perfect...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:25]** Or you could just shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** So you're saying there's a chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** So you're saying there's a chance.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** So you're saying I could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:40]** I love that the hallway is now cleared and it's just Bernice and Melt-A-Man and Koneko and Rick19 standing right on top of Bernice.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** Y'all are pulling them in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:52]** Okay, so in any case, I want them to go past the first room.

**[00:30:52 - 00:31:17]** so i'm gonna i'm gonna create a diversion in some way okay uh either through firing just down the hallway randomly yep with the vapor cavitation pistol and then i'm gonna maybe maybe i'll move and then i'll yeah i'm gonna move past nico yep and just fire randomly okay love that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:21]** Probably looks crazy to Koneko to see the briefcase.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** Fired in the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:30]** What the f***?

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** It's giving me like a collider.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:40]** Oh, it's because you are... It's because you're linked to move with you, which is not the case.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** You should be able to move separately from...

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** I think I can move, Bernice.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:44]** I got it.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** I got it.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:45]** Cool.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** Okay.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:48]** So, Dr. K, you're staying where you are.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:51]** What are you doing with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:51]** I did that.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:54]** I pirated Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** That's right.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:55]** Thank you.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:55]** Thank you.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:56]** Cool.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:56]** Okay.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** Pulling them back.

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** Trying to pull them in.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** I like it.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:00]** I like it.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:02]** Are you still hiding?

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:02]** Yes.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:05]** Or is that another move action to...

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** I think you've been hitting this whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:07]** Yeah.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:09]** I don't think that you need to redo it.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:12]** If you've not moved, you don't lose your condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** Yeah.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:13]** You were good.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:17]** It is now Hesper Valdez's turn.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:27]** And Hesper is going to step up and say, you might hear Rick and say, I'll finish him.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:38]** And then these glowing orbs begin to appear around Hesper's hands as Hesper is going to cast Magic Missile.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** F***.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** At Rick19.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:43]** It's like a shadow of d***.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:46]** Had to move, so it's not going to be a full action.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:51]** So it's going to be, let's see, how many...

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:55]** Yeah, so if it's at first level, that's going to be how many?

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:55]** Two?

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** Two or three?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** It doesn't scale.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:00]** If he takes a full action, it'll be three.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:00]** How many missiles?

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:01]** Two.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** Two missiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** D4 plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:07]** Unless he does full action, which is three, yeah.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:11]** Right, so it's 2D4 plus... Yeah, 2D4 plus two in this case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:22]** All right, that is seven points of damage as Colin, you see three missiles fly past the door and hit Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** God dang it.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** On second thought, Meltzman, move forward.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:31]** That's what I'm saying, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:34]** Tell Meltaman the directive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** Meltaman wearing that red shirt with pride.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** Hey, yo, Meltaman.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:39]** Hey, bro.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:41]** Meltaman knows what's good.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** Rick19, how are you doing?

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** Do you want to share with the class?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:45]** Okay, cool.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** You're fine.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:49]** I still have stamina is all I'm going to say.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:51]** You still have stamina?

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** Okay, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** When you didn't fall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** My beer is empty, though, so I need to refill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:05]** Aeol smiles and is going to unleash a full action against you with their squad machine gun.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** Not supercharged, though.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** Not supercharged.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:32]** not supercharged to be clear to be clear so it's a full action so it's gonna be minus four and roll this dice that i got i believe i got it in maine it has like a skull in it because hopefully i can kill over 19 that's gonna be two attacks out of minus four to my penalty that's gonna be a 22 to my ac plus two to your ac why again oh yes thank you beautiful so that's a 22 to hit

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** That hits.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** That is a hit.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:39]** That is going to be 11 points of damage.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:42]** You have a minus four, and it's still a 22.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:42]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:50]** Don't forget, this is what we talked about when we were, and I think I made the mistake, too, when Kev was GMing.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** Kev would just hit with these crazy numbers.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** I was like, how are you doing this?

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:55]** It's like, that's the name of the game.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** Now I'm into my hit points.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** Okay, that's a 23 to hit.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Two more shots.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:03]** What?

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** That's 13 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:10]** I'm doing real well with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:14]** My resolve is also not fully replenished.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** So that's going to be fun.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:23]** That is a full action from the armored human ale.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:28]** Man, if I was prone in the back of this hallway, none of those would have hit me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** The situation.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** What are you doing?

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:32]** Rick 19 is getting pummeled in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:35]** If wishes and butts were candy and nuts, we'd all have a Merry Christmas.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:37]** This is a long conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** Thanks, Mad Mystics, for the win.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:47]** So he hears if the serums only heal HP.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:53]** Not stamina, correct?

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** The King's English.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:55]** Yes.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:59]** They heal HP.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:01]** Yes, the HP, but not the stamina.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:03]** I'm sorry.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** Rick, what's your stamina?

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** What's your HP again?

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:07]** How much have you lost out of your max?

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** I have to do math on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:14]** From a metagaming perspective.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Yeah, there's a lot going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** What are you doing here?

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** Thanks, Will.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** Oh, he just said, do your thing.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:20]** Is that what you said?

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:21]** All right.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** Is that what you said?

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:23]** Yes.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Like Colin?

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** All right.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:25]** All right.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:26]** All right.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:29]** So here's like calls out Chad.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:33]** And Chad just like, you know, apparates in front of him.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:34]** Yeah.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** Invisibly, of course, because he's not visible.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:37]** Burrito in hand.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** Hey, Chad.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:38]** Yeah.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** Here's what's going on.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:48]** And he spits out the burrito and like, he's like, all right, Chad, I have something very important for you.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** And he hands him a serum.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:51]** He's like, Rick, you remember Rick, right?

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** Oh, yeah, man.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** It's right around that corner.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** I need you to just stab this in his back.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** That's what I need you to do.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** Okay.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:01]** Pretend it's Call of Duty or something and you're sneaking up and you're trying to knife him in the back.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** You like that, right?

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** I know you like that.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Gives him a wink.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:09]** And then because it's a move action, Chad is going to go do that.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:13]** So he goes out the door and puts a Mark II healing serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:17]** You can control the hooded figure that I put onto Foundry right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** This is complicated.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** I know, I know.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:22]** But I think it's a full action to give a serum to somebody else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Yes, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** It's a standard action to give a serum to yourself.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** Even for my boy, Chad.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:48]** even for your boy chad all right chad is gonna hold it and be ready to well you're also within you're within five feet of me you're just outside the door yeah i know the only problem is that you don't have yeah you don't have the serum in your hand so it's a move action to pull the serum out hand it to and and then as well just like and put it inside of you and then go you should just do it you yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** God, why do I suck so much at this?

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:51]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:59]** So, like, OK, I mean, your whole turn should be pulling that serum out and then calling and waiting for me to go down.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** Here's pulls the serum out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** I just wanted to see Chad again.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:03]** All right.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** All right.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** It's fine.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** No, I don't need it.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** It's all right.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** I'm going to do it myself.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:08]** See you later.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:10]** I'm sorry.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** I'm not really good at the rules aspect of this game.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:14]** You spin a full standard action.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:17]** You're like, hey, man, how's it going in there?

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** You good?

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:22]** After all, just go back to playing Call of Duty, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:24]** Sweet, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:29]** So you pull out the serum and then... Okay.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:30]** All right.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:33]** Waits very, very excitedly at the edge of the door, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:34]** Okay.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:34]** Okay.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:35]** Sounds good.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** Sounds good.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** That's your turn.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** Kaniko.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** It is Kaniko's turn.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:45]** What I need to look at real quick is how many times Kaniko can do Inspiring Boost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:50]** I think just once per day or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:54]** Once per person per rest, I think.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:57]** Yeah, once your allies benefited from it, they can't.

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:00]** Yeah, you have to take a 10-minute rest before you can get it again.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** Okay.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** Just give me 10 minutes.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** Yeah, yeah, sure.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:05]** Why don't we just wait for 10 minutes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** You'll definitely live that long.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** He just holds his finger up.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** It takes 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Yeah, no, you definitely will.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:10]** You definitely will.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** Loading, loading.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Okay.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:28]** All right, Kaniko is going to take her gun and she wants to... You already have covering fire, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Yeah.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** Well, from the one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** Right, right, right, right, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** That wouldn't, yeah.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:39]** If they're doing, like, spells, it wouldn't really help anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** Well, she's trying to do something to help out.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** But I think, you know what?

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:48]** She is going to non-lethally fire at Ale.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** Actually, you know what she's going to do?

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:55]** She's going to take a step forward, and she is going to say, You can just go to hell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:56 - 00:41:02]** Meltaman, I need you to attack Hesper or Orgat or Ale right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** Yes, of course, Kaniko.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:08]** I hear you loud and clear.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:11]** And Meltaman will now come into the turn order.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:14]** So that, I think, was a move and a free action, right?

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** For her to step forward and say that.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:21]** Oh, but she needs to probably... Would she need to do a computer check in order to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** Probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** Yeah, I think she would.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:27]** Is that her song suit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:27]** Not at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** Is it a computer check to use like Alexa?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:36]** Well, it's because it's technically the only listen to Kelly right now or the four of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:43]** Yeah, and she's not like the owner of, like, it's like, can she go up to Bernice and be like, hey, Bernice, go do this.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** Like, would Bernice do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:47]** Also, he has a command that he was already given just a second ago.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** So it's confirmed.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** Oh, you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** Go in a room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:54]** All preventing me from going to Rome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** That was the room.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:55]** Thank you.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:57]** I totally forgot about that.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** Okay, so she's not going to do any of that.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:03]** So Melted Man is going to move into the room because that was your command, right, Rick19?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:07]** I told Melted Man to attack him.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:10]** No, I told Melted Man to get into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:13]** Melted Man walks into the room next to the situation.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:24]** Kaniko is going to move forward, walk past you, and take a shot at Ale non-lethally.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:28]** That is going to be a non-lethals minus four, right?

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:30]** So that's a 17.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** She is trying to protect you in this moment.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** Don't worry.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** She is going to take that cover.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** That is going to be a hit on Ale.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** Nice.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:44]** Since they have not been injured in one whole episode and this episode here.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:49]** That is going to be a solid eight points of damage to Ale.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:52]** That is Kaniko's turn.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** Finally, some damage on the board.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:57]** Don't worry, Rick19.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** Orgot.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:01]** Orgot.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:10]** Rick19, you notice that Orgot begins to run forward.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:16]** And she runs and stops right in front of the door with Colin and Dr. OK.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:36]** Colin and Rick, you see that her jaw, her half-orc jaw, begins to extend further than it should as she reaches out and bites Kaniko with this massive jaw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:40]** Talk about halitosis.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** Is that gross?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** It is wild.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:47]** If you want to look and see what it is, you can always do a check.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:50]** And that's going to be a good hit.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** That was a 23.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Running forward.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** Ooh, question.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** No, she would not get an AOL from Dr. O.K.

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:00]** Because there's cover between Dr. O.K.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** and Orga.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** Moving into that square.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** And if there's cover, there's no AOA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:08]** Was Cullen delayed in action?

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** No?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** Nope.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:12]** That's six points of damage to Kaniko.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:17]** You see this huge bite come out of her regimental armor.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** Part of her regimental armor.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:47]** armor what's it called the pauldrons on the shoulder just gets like crushed and dented in and the rest of it just goes underneath into her armpit ripping away some of the muscles in her pecs and chest vicious attack from orgott it's cool ability that she has it is round three a lot has happened lots changed since the start around two colin what are you doing now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:49 - 00:45:02]** Um, Colin is first going to take a shot with his Needler pistol at Orgat.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** Oh, please hit, please hit.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** This is the serum shot, right?

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** With the serum.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** Yo, you better hit, dude.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** You better hit, man.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Watch me f*** this up.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** What's it going to be?

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** What's it going to be?

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:23]** Let's get it.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** Let's get it.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** Let's get it.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** Let's get it.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:30]** Not terrible.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Not great.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** That's a 19 on the die.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:35]** That's got to hit.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** I think it's going to hit.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** Probably fine, right?

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** Hopefully.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Jaw dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Right into her neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:44]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:44]** Roll four.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:45]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:50]** She succeeds at her fortitude saving throw.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:52]** So roll 4D10.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:53]** Give me half.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** Again, 4D10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** Roll high.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:00]** Roll super high.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** I had to find 4D10.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Such a good noise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:06]** It's a good noise.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** It's a good noise, baby.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** It's really nice.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:08]** Okay.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** There's a 10 and a 9.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:11]** Uh-huh.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:11]** Uh-huh.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:12]** Ooh.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** That's 19.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** But there's also a 3 and a 2.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:21]** So that's 19 plus 5 is 24, half to 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:24]** Okay, so she takes 12 points of damage.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:31]** When she gets hit, her whole body just slumps for a second, and then she comes back.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:38]** Her jaw is still this elongated jaw with extra rows of teeth that glint.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:42]** But you can see for a minute that she doesn't know where she is, and she snaps into it.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:49]** So from now on, she is going to have the confused condition, and she might not attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:50 - 00:47:18]** because of that serum it didn't take her out but it is giving her a chance to maybe realize what is going on maybe break through some of this programming so from the bed from your sniper's perch yep you shoot pretty cool and he's going to miss miss he's gonna instruct his wisp ally to move to orgots square and provide carrying fire


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:21]** Ooh, okay.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:25]** Multicolor red light with a little bit of other hues flies over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:29]** So Orgott gets a minus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** Hey!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:31]** Hey!

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:31]** Listen!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:32]** Hey!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:33]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:35]** What's up?

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:37]** Okay, so Orgott has a minus two to her attacks.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** Cool.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:40]** Sorry, sorry, sorry.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:42]** You're shaking your head because I forgot what's covering for her.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:43]** There it is.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:44]** Okay.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** Wow.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:45]** Dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** Solid.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** Rick 18.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** Yes.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:50]** Cool.

**[00:47:51 - 00:48:00]** So as that's happening, Rick puts his gun, he reaches forward and makes Kanika move out of the way just in time for him to get his cannon up.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:03]** And he's going to shoot Orgat.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:08]** That's a 19 on the die for a total of 20.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** It's plus five.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** It's 24.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:14]** But then she's also got the minus two from a herring fire.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** So remember that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:20]** But she also... Does she have plus... Because she has partial cover from Kaniko standing in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:20]** Right.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** So there's a...

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:25]** Plus four, so it's a plus two to her.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:26]** Got it.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Does a 24 hit?

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:30]** Oh, yeah, 24 definitely hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:35]** Just right in the gut as she's kind of swimming a little bit, trying to come through.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** No, that's a 12.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** Toothy maw in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** This is my D10.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:39]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:46]** That's a four plus five is nine points of, oh shit.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** I did not, I was going to do non-lethal.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** So it's another minus four.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** So it's a 20 hit.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** Still hits.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:53]** Sweet.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** Okay.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** So that's nine points of non-lethal damage.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:56]** Wow.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** As the shot hits her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:05]** She's not looking good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** Can I do a check for the Ma thing?

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** Is that a physical science?

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** Is that life science?

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:13]** You could do a life science, sure.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** I think that would probably be it.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:18]** You could also do a mysticism check if you wanted to.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** I'll do life science.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:22]** It's a 14 for life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:25]** Okay.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:31]** What you find and remember is that as a... Ooh, nice.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** As a...

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:55]** mystic given her let's call it specialty her connection right she has an ability called carnivorous which allows her to want to taste blood and her jaw elongates and she gets this bite ability with these extra rows mystic thing what the f**k


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:18]** um cool so then lastly rick is going to he's gonna sweet like he takes that shot and then he is just gonna push back and and turn around and he's gonna take a swift action as he moves to slide prone next to bernice wow so bernice is in the like side by side with him and he's now prone and setting up his artillery laser for the next shot


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:23]** Pulling the Thaddeus.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:25]** I like it.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:25]** It's good.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:31]** And right before he pushes off, he tells Kaniko, like, take cover, get in a room, and then that's when he darts back and slides.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** Okay.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** All right.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** I like it.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:35]** Good turn.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:43]** You take a shot at Orgot, and then you're like, yo, let me button slide down to the back, and I'm going to take a shot when I get it clear.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** Dr.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** O.K., what are you doing?

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:48]** All this is happening right outside, and you're cool as a cucumber.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:50]** No, Dr. O.K.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:52]** is not cool as a cucumber.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:54]** He is nervous.

**[00:50:55 - 00:51:01]** And as part of that, just before he's...

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:14]** Just before he's about to control Bernice, he lets out a little secretion quietly on the floor in front of him.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:16]** A little puddle of slime.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:20]** That's awesome.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** Making it difficult to read.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:48]** nice amazing that's so good this is this is such a good character moment that you're nervous yes colin you're probably like uh what just happened yeah um and he's going to take control piloting bernice he's gonna make bernice is gonna take a few steps up so that's yeah okay 30 feet's good

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:56]** And then shoot at Hesper through cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:57]** Okay.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** Through the soft cover of... Okay.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** Through at Hesper all the way in the back.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** Or I guess... Yeah.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** Aeoli.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:06]** Aeol.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** Yeah.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:08]** Okay.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** So there's Orgot.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** This one's Aeoli.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** Yeah.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:15]** So Aeol is the one who has the large gun, the human with the large gun.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** Yeah.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:17]** Is that what you meant?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** Yes.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Okay.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:24]** Because I feel like Orgat's taken care of.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:28]** We should try to draw the rest of them, get them in the fight.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** And, yeah, I'm just going to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** Okay.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Hesper is the Lushenta.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** So you're shooting at Eyal, pulling him into the fight.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:38]** Got soft cuff.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** What's your roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** I actually rolled a natural 20.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** No way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:44]** Yes.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** Bernice.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:46]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:51]** Bernice just crept up and just had it dialed.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** And, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** I love this.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** Bernice coming through.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** Let me get out the cards.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:02]** And we're going to see what kind of crit.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** Unless you don't want to do the cards.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** Because it's still double damage, right?

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** I feel like Bernice would want to do the crit.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:10]** Okay.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Let's see what the crit's going to be.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:14]** Tell me when to stop.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:14]** Ready?

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** Three, two, one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:15]** Boop, boop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:22]** Okay, what kind of weapon is this this is the vapor cavitation pistol?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:24]** Sweet which is energy, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:29]** It's energy and fire damage energy and fire Which way?

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:40]** The target is flat-footed for 1d four rounds fortitude negates I just roll for damage

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** Yes.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:46]** I need to see what the DC is going to be in order to make that happen.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:51]** The DC is one half the character level, which is rounded down, so it's two.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** What's your key ability score again?

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:54]** Intelligence?

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:55]** Yes.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** What's your intelligence score?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** Mine or Bernice's?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:01]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:01]** Bernice's.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Plus two.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:04]** Plus two.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Okay.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:10]** Dr. O'Kays is plus four, if that makes any difference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:11]** Okay.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** I think it would be Bernice's, right?

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:13]** Yeah.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** So, yeah.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:17]** Yeah, well, they have to roll pretty low.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** Okay.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:18]** All right.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:19]** Is this right?

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:26]** It says the save DC for an effect inflicted by a PC is one half character level plus key ability score.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:29]** Their key ability score, I would think.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** Oh, is it them?

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:34]** I mean, you're the one to save, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** I would have to save.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:41]** Wow, this is like so much more confusing than it needs to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:47]** Doesn't the caster or the weapon fire set the DC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** Yeah, I think that would be the case.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:53]** So they would need to roll pretty low, which they don't have the best fortitude.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:57]** So it's going to be a DC... DC 14.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:01]** It's one half the character level plus the key ability score.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:04]** And half your character level is 2.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** Plus your ability score is 2.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:06]** That doesn't seem right.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** That seems really low.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:08]** I think it's plus 10.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** So it's going to be 14.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:14]** So Aeol needs to get a fortitude below.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** They got a 16, so they passed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:20]** So they're not flat-footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** They are not flat-footed.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** Long story short.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** Okay, but you still do damage.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** Do your double damage.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:29]** Yeah, I rolled six points total.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** Six points of damage.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:33]** Hey, that is good.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:35]** We are getting something on the board here.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** Okay.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:40]** Lines up the right shot.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:43]** Takes a shot at Aeol.

**[00:55:43 - 00:56:09]** crits ale they're able to stay on their feet but they are confused you want to do anything else with your turn doctor okay besides your awesome secretion your nervousness that was cool that's it okay that's all i do okay good turn good turn it's going to be hesper's turn and you know what they're going to do magic missile they're they're going to magic missile kanika

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** Full action.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:15]** Thank God it's not Rick, at least.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** That's good.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** Yeah, they are trying to take y'all down.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** I'm mad at John for moving Kaniko forward, though.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** Okay.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:24]** That's 12 points of damage to Kaniko.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** Uh-huh.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:34]** As three more bolts streak across the lounge of the void crier.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** It is Ale's turn.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:40]** Yo, I'm worried for Kaniko.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:42]** I am not going to lie.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** All right.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:46]** Ale is going to also.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:48]** Actually, what would Ale?

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:51]** This is like doesn't want to hit Orgat.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:54]** That's a tough one.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:55]** That's a tough one.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** A.L.

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:04]** is going to ready an action as soon as Orgat either moves or goes down.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:05]** A.L.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:08]** is going to take a shot at whoever is in the hallway at that time.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** They are posted up.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:13]** Here's the situation for Briseis.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:15]** What are you doing about this situation?

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:18]** I don't know where Decker went.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:22]** Decker is at the end of the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** But I guess you don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:26]** Decker was actually in his office in Maryland.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** Oh, you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:27]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:29]** Wait, he's at the very far left?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:33]** You saw Rick19 run past.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:33]** That's it.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** That's all that you saw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** Which direction did he run?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** To the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:37]** I went to the left.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:38]** Oh, okay.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:39]** Um...

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** Okay.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** I feel so useless.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:46]** What creature rating are these guys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** That's not something I can give you.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:51]** No, you can't really roll for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:51]** All right.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** All right.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:57]** I'm guessing, like, Kevin's going to try some crazy shit, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:59]** This is my crazy shit.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:01]** I now have a plus four to my ranged AC.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:07]** So I'm just going to lay here and take ranged shots until... Until what?

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:11]** Until you guys can subdue them with the serums that they made.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:11]** That's the whole point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** The serums that they made?

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:14]** What do you mean?

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:16]** We have serums.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:20]** But you need to take them out first, basically, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:25]** No, the serum will take them out, but we are trying to be...

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:28]** Perhaps foolishly tactical.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:33]** So, like, you're trying to lure them forward a bit, and then we can go out and jump them with these f***ing serums.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:34]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:37]** Right, the serum has 4d10 of non-lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:38]** Yeah.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:40]** And it changes their attitude or something.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:41]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:42]** All right.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:44]** Here's is going to, like, cast daze.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** No, sorry, not daze.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** Yeah, daze.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:50]** Like, on...

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** On the nearest one.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** So that's what he's going to do.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:54]** Okay.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:57]** Do you have to have line of sight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:57]** Or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:57]** Yeah.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** So that's what I'm trying to figure out right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:02]** Yeah, I don't think you have line of sight to Orgat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:05]** Either way, I'm opening myself up getting attacked no matter what I do.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** Okay.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:07]** Right.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** So then...

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** I think if you're at the door, you would have line of sight.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:14]** I'm at the door, but according to Hero Lab... Oh, now I do.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** But that's... What's your name?

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** That's where Melted Man is.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** I'm sorry, guys.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** I know I'm sitting on this a lot.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:28]** If you're standing at the door and they're 20 feet down the hall and you're not out the door, I don't think you would have line of sight.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** Yeah, then I can't fucking see him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:30]** Fuck it.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:32]** All right, cool.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** Here's just going to go to like...

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:36]** Rick, there's another door down that way.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** So what he's going to do is he's going to go out here.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:45]** He's going to like, can I like cast something from inside of this room if I'm that close to Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** Yeah, because I'm adjacent to that room.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** So here's, thank you.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:52]** So here's, it's going to go, the rules lawyer is going to run in.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:56]** So here's, it's going to go in here and then he's going to supercharge Rick's weapon.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** All right.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** Oh, wow.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** That's what he's going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** They can take some back.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** What?

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:01]** Okay.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** I love it, though.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** I love the imagery.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:11]** Like, he just goes scurrying out of the hallway, down the hallway, into another room, and then you see his hand come out and, like, touch the artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:20]** You just see, like, a little insectoid hand reach out, and he, like, looks at Rick, and he's like, you know what's coming, don't you?

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:26]** And then, like, you know, Rick points his, I'm guessing, pushes his gun forward, and he goes, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:29]** Amazing.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:29]** I love it.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:31]** Orange will love emanating.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:31]** Love it.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:33]** Good stuff.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:34]** Love that.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** That's his turn.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** That's your turn.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:40]** Y'all are moving tactically, though.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:43]** The tides are starting to shift a little bit.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** It's Kaniko Breeze's turn.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** Kaniko is not great.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:57]** So in her regimental dress now, torn left arm, pec damaged, blood starting to mess up the floor.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:59]** She's going to take a guarded step back.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:00]** Yes.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:06]** and then is going to move into the room, heeding Rick19's advice.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:11]** And she's pretty low, so it's not great.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** That's her turn.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** It is Orgotnalkus' turn.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:18]** Orgotnalkus is confused.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:22]** When was the last time we had the confused condition here?

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:24]** Oh, man, I don't know.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:25]** It's been a hot minute.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:27]** I hope you roll to hit yourself.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:31]** You roll a D100, and there are four different opportunities.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** Either act normally.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:35]** Well, I won't spoil it.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:36]** We'll see what happens.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:44]** So the big thing is that you are mentally befuddled and can't act normally.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:47]** You can't tell the difference between ally and foe.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:49]** Yeah, not too high.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:53]** And what is normal for her is the real question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:55]** Just saying.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:56]** It's a deep question.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** I do like that.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:01]** Act normally.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:04]** It's interesting.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:11]** I think that would mean... Actually, so she rolled an 18, which is... Act normal.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:12]** Act normal.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:13]** Act normal.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** And I think...

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:21]** Based on the serum and the hit, she would act normal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** Like, actually normal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:25]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:29]** She snaps out for a second, at least for this round.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:31]** Looks around.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:34]** Sees you training down the site, Rick19.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:38]** Like, in the red lights of the hallway.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** Doesn't know exactly what's going on.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** Looks back.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:43]** See Ale ready to take a shot.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:43]** F***.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:47]** And is going to... She's going to side with the Pykes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:56]** She is going to look and say, What is going on here?

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** Ayo, why are you attacking?

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:02]** Why are you attacking Rick19 here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** Get down!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:26]** rick shots at her oh oh what is she gonna do oh this is a tough call i think you should roll it i think i should roll it too that's exactly what i was thinking dr okay slash pull a shock flip slash time traveler uh do you want me to roll like uh diplomacy or something

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:30]** If you you just said get down, that's all that you said.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:34]** So if so, if you had decided to say something else, then I may be able to give it to you.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:37]** But I'm not going to retroactively after you say get down, actually get down.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:40]** But actually, what's really happening is that there's like that.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** Get down.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:42]** Get down.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:43]** Get down on it.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:44]** You've all gone mad.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** They've all gone mad, I swear.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:48]** No, they're the bad guy.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:50]** All right, so I just rolled.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:50]** I'm not going to look at it.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:54]** I'm going to say that above 50 should be sides with Rick.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:58]** Below 50, sides with Ayo and Pikes.

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:00]** Come on, baby.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** Let's do it.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:01]** 37.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:02]** Ugh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:07]** Well, you could blast both of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:09]** You could blast both of them.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** She is going to.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:12]** She did not have.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:14]** Ooh, ooh, ooh.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** Okay.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** She is still carnivorous.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:27]** She hears you say, get down, but looks at Eyal and looks at Hesper beyond and thinks, Rick 19 is sus.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:34]** So she is going to run down the hallway and attack Rick 19 and bite Rick 19.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:38]** Now, this does mean that, oh, Bernice is there.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:41]** So she would go.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:46]** Are you saying she's going to run past?

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:51]** I was thinking that she would run past, but Kaniko would also.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:54]** That's what I'm thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:56]** That's what I'm thinking.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** That's what I'm thinking.

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:02]** So, even though she's tiny, I don't think that she can move through the square, right?

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:05]** She can, yeah.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:08]** It's still an enemy square.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:11]** I think she would need to... Well, there's no AOA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:16]** I think you can move through a smaller square or smaller creature square.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:17]** No problem.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:19]** It's like one step smaller or something like that.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:19]** Whatever the rule is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:20]** Yeah.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:23]** And Kaniko doesn't have a melee weapon out.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:26]** So Orgat's going to run down the hall and attack Rick19.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:29]** Well, that's cool.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:32]** It's only a 14 against KAC.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:34]** And she has what?

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:38]** Covering fire, which only affects her AC, right?

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:40]** So... Actually, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:42]** Is the wisp on her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:44]** The wisp is on her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:49]** I thought the wisp was on... I thought you moved the wisp.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:54]** Oh, so then that's herring fire on her, not covering fire?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:56]** Yes.

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:58]** Which would mean that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:01]** So you said it's a 14 to hit KAC?

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:05]** Yeah, it's a 14 against KAC.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:08]** Well, my KAC is 20, and I'm on the...

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:14]** but I'm prone, so it's at minus four, but it's still 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:15]** She is bending over.

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:26]** You are prone, and she is trying to run low and just clearly misses you, but these two rows of gleaming teeth come down right in front of your face, trying to bite your arm.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:28]** She misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:32]** Do I get an attack of opportunity since she just ran right by me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** Ooh, do you have a melee weapon?

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:35]** Not unless you have a melee weapon.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** I have one.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:38]** And there's cover, so you wouldn't have...

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:44]** She would have cover when she moved from the square to where she is now.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:49]** So you wouldn't be able to attack her because any cover means you don't get an AOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:50]** Even though she's literally through the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:52]** No, dude, she's literally in front.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:56]** She is in front of the open door, I think.

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:58]** But the AOL is when you leave a threatened square.

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:00]** Right, it's not when you come in.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:02]** Yeah, that's true.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:03]** Good point.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:06]** That's the end of round three.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:07]** It's round four.

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:08]** What are you doing, Colin?

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:11]** Colin has something to say.

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:13]** Colin's raising their hand.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:14]** Tell me, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:19]** So I'm reading in the Tactical Rules page 256 of the Core Rulebook.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:22]** For those of you following along at home.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:23]** Moving through occupied squares.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:24]** Moving through a creature's space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:30]** You may be able to move through an occupied square without difficulty in certain circumstances with different effects based on the creature in a given square as noted below.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:31]** Opponent.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:39]** You can't normally move through a square that is occupied by an opponent, but you can move through a square that is occupied by a helpless opponent without penalty.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:45]** That is the only provision I see for moving through opponent squares.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:48]** Not for size.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:50]** The problem is that she's tiny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:50]** Yeah.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:51]** Yeah.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:52]** I don't know.

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:56]** I've seen discussions on Reddit to like, uh, moving inside.

**[01:07:56 - 01:08:01]** Cause like you can have up to four tiny creatures in a square.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:04]** And if they're diminutive, it's like 25 or something.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:09]** So I think it's like, it's kind of your call, but if you do it, treat it raw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:18]** If you treat it fully raw, I think, uh, it also, it also says you can attempt a tumble, which is an acrobatic skill.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:19]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:31]** I think that because Bernice is tiny and didn't have out a melee weapon, it just, it makes sense that she would be able to run by like that to me doesn't make sense that she would tumble from like a suitcase that was in the thing.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:34]** Like, Oh, let me, let me jump by that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:35]** Well, a tumble is going into it.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:39]** So like they would do intentionally to avoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:40]** Yeah.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:41]** You can only tumble through.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:41]** Right.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:42]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:43]** Right.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:44]** Yeah.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:45]** Okay.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:45]** Right.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:46]** Cool.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:47]** Yeah.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:47]** Sorry.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:49]** I was just digging into the core rule book.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:50]** I'm going to step in.

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:54]** It's good to dig into the main texture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:56]** Don't step into the hallways.

**[01:08:56 - 01:08:59]** You got to go through my dangerous terrain.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:00]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:01]** Where is that?

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:03]** It's in front of me by the door.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:04]** In front of the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:06]** Oh, it's in front of the door.

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:07]** Okay.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:07]** All right.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:08]** I'm going to draw it right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:09]** I think it just slows down your movement, to be honest.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:11]** Yeah.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:12]** It's not like you slip on it.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:13]** It's not ball-based.


## Speaker_0

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:27]** So I'm going to pop out here, spot Orgat, and I'm going to cast Telekinetic Projectile.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:29]** Non-lethally?

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:34]** Non-lethally, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:39]** Okay, non-lethal telekinetic projectile down at Orgat.

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:41]** Give me a roll.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:43]** So this is... What are you throwing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:45]** Some of Dr. Okay's accretion?

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:47]** Yeah, I'm going to throw some ooze.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:48]** That's cool.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:49]** Ivanooze?

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:51]** Ivanooze.

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:53]** My ranged attack... Like a snowball?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:56]** Oh, man.

**[01:09:56 - 01:09:57]** Is it?

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:58]** Where's that ranged attack?

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:59]** Probably your dex place your base.

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:00]** Right.

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:01]** Ranged attack.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:01]** There it is.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:01]** Plus seven.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:02]** Found it.

**[01:10:03 - 01:10:03]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:06]** Hey, look over here.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:07]** That's a 17 to hit.

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:09]** Yeah, that's a hit, dog.

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:09]** Awesome.

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:11]** That's a hit.

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:13]** Telekinetic projectile.

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:18]** That is 1d6 bludgeoning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:19]** Ooh, plus anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:22]** For three slime damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:22 - 01:10:28]** three slime damage as maybe a bit of slime flies and hits Rick just on the shoulder.

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:29]** So I'm a Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:30]** So crucial.

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:32]** And then I'm going to duck back into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:34]** Can you spell?

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:35]** Yes, you can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:37]** Oh, that's right.

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:37]** We talked about this.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:38]** Also.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:43]** I love the idea that like, what shape does the, does, does, does the ooze take?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:43 - 01:10:58]** I feel like it takes like a, so like, I think it's kind of gelatinous as it leaves, but as it moves, it like forms more wholly into a, like an oval spiraling through the air.

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:02]** And it just like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:04]** Hits freaking awesome.

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:07]** Love that.

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:08]** Good turn.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:09]** Step out.

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:10]** Fire something.

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:11]** Step back.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:11]** That's it.

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:12]** Fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:13]** Very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:13]** Okay, that's it.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:15]** Rick19, what are you doing?

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:17]** You have Orgot trying to gnash your face in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:19]** You got a supercharged weapon.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:22]** Blaster right at the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:23 - 01:11:27]** except it's a ranged attack and I'm in melee range.

**[01:11:27 - 01:11:29]** So I don't want to take an attack of opportunity.

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:33]** Um, or do you, you want to risk it?

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:34]** No, I don't.

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:36]** I do have improved unarmed strike.

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:38]** So I think I'm doing an unarmed strike.

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:43]** I lose a supercharge, which sucks, but wait, no.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:46]** Cause the supercharge is on the weapon, not on my attack.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:46]** Right.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:47]** Read supercharge for me.

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:49]** Cause maybe you supercharged my hands.

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:50]** Um,

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:54]** And I'm trying to see if I take unarmed strike.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:58]** I think unproved unarmed strike makes it lethal.

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:59]** You can for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:00]** Supercharged weapon.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:02]** Yeah.

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:05]** But you're losing 4d6 additional damage.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:09]** So wait, if you put that away, it's gone?

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:10]** You can't bring it out later with the supercharged weapon?

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:11]** It's gone.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:12]** Oh, it's the next one.

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:13]** The next round, yeah.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:16]** Do what you gotta do, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:20]** But now... You can't deal lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:22]** It doesn't say anything about rounds.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:25]** It says, like, I think before... It's the next attack.

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:26]** What's the duration?

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:27]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:28]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:31]** From a weapon, not from... Okay, cool, cool.

**[01:12:31 - 01:12:31]** I'm for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:35]** If the weapon's next attack... That's right.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:36]** Yeah, you're right, you're right.

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:38]** So you can still keep it.

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:41]** Yeah, actually...

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:46]** So you could probably do... You could even pull out another weapon and save it for later, actually, at this rate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:49]** He just puts the laser away.

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:55]** No, what he's going to do is actually... Since I have an improved unarmed strike, I'm going to take a non-lethal unarmed strike attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:57]** That is the actual language of the attack, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:57 - 01:13:02]** It does say, if the weapon's next attack hits, provided it is made before the end of the next round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:05]** Why did I not read that?

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:06]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:06]** It's fine.

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:10]** I'd much rather try to take down Orgot than...

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:11]** Take an attack for opportunity.

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:13]** So, unarmed strike.

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:14]** Unarmed strike.

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:18]** 14 plus 3 is 17 to hit.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:19]** That is a hit.

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:20]** All right.

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:21]** Yeah.

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:23]** That's non-lethal, by the way.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:24]** Okay.

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:25]** You sure you don't want to murder bot it up?

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:27]** I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:27]** I do not.

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:29]** She's already taken a lot from you, man.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:30]** She wants to take more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:34]** That's a 1d6 plus 7 for my unarmed strike.

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:35]** Dang.

**[01:13:36 - 01:13:39]** So, that's 9 points of non-lethal damage.

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:44]** And so he's got his laser and she steps right in front of him and bites down at him.

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:52]** And he just like looks up at her and then reaches for her leg and just says, I said, get down and like yanks her ankle.

**[01:13:53 - 01:13:54]** Nice.

**[01:13:54 - 01:13:56]** And hard enough, hopefully to knock her out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:03]** She falls to the ground and there's a sickening as she falls unconscious.

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:05]** That's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:14:05 - 01:14:08]** Yes.

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:08]** Wow.
