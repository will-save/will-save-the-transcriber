## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:22]** Hello friends, welcome to my channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:22]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:26]** We'll Save the Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** Episode 109, 109, 109.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** My name is John Swan.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:31]** I am your, what did I write?

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** Replicating GM.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:39]** And I'm joined by my fantastic people, Vinny, Will, Kelly, and Kevin.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** It's good to see you all.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:43]** Another week here at the We'll Save the Podcast, The Table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:45]** I wish I could say the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:48]** I'm not nervous at all.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** Wow.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:52]** You not excited to be here at We'll Save the Table?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** No, I'm excited to be at The Table.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:58]** I just like... Last episode was just...

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:01]** All the things I wish I could do if I could just get rid of the paranoia in my brain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:06]** Do you think you would enjoy the game more if you weren't so paranoid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:10]** I kind of feel like... I don't think I would enjoy it more.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** It would be different, that's all.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** It would be a different kind of enjoyment.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:22]** I kind of like leaning into the spookiness of it and the non-trustingness of it, for lack of a better word.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** I don't know.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** I feel like it works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:28]** I stopped taking my meds 50 episodes ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:52]** we'll stop to like episode two he's like yeah that's it well kelly the thing about the game sorry i've been good i feel like you're gonna have thoughts well yeah i was i was gonna say i feel like i'm i start to miss some of migo's recklessness uh getting back into colin because like colin is is a much more calculated and measured individual than migo is


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** But does he have to be forever?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:53 - 00:03:04]** But this is also like, you know, in the entertainment industry, there are young reckless riggers and there are old careful riggers and there are no old reckless riggers.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:14]** And so I feel like in this same case, if I had that same recklessness that I had with Migo, I would not still be on my first character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** Yeah, that's the thing.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:24]** Okay, the thing about this AP is, like, you're not rewarded in any way, really, it seems, for, like, taking risks like that.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:25]** Right.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** You aren't.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:29]** Like, it's not like it's going to, like, help you out that much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:31]** Stockholm Syndrome, the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** It's a challenging one for sure.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:35]** Yeah.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:41]** I absolutely don't deny that and can see that how it will be, how that would be the case.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:46]** The good thing about this AP, like life, is that, you know, life is long.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** This is a six book AP.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** And it tricks you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:51]** And it's full of terrors around every corner.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** And nothing is what it seems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:53]** Yeah.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:56]** And you had to fight like a worm that's like a dune worm.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** And yeah, I had that happen to me one time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** There's a dune worm?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:05]** Yeah, I mean, everyone's got to drink the water of life at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** Everyone's got to drink the water of life.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Yeah, you're not wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:13]** Kelly's talking about that worm in book two that we were like, f*** that.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** Not touching that thing.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:21]** Was that the origin of hashtag it's okay to walk away?

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** Is that it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:25]** Well, I remember we have Finder with us right now.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** We do.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:28]** That was the origin of that hashtag.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** And Finder, I remember at the time, he's like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:48]** i don't i don't think y'all should have run away from that like i remember that like that was just like common and we're like we've missed a lot of good things because john cranked up the paranoia a little too early i think literally turn a corner there's a monster turn a corner there's a monster

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** Yeah, turn a corner, there's a grey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:55]** You said something incredibly harrowing evil behind that door.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** Do you want to open it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** We were like, nah, I'm good.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:03]** We're just chickens.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** No, it's the book we're not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** We were the closest to dying in book two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** There's two thought processes here.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:14]** You grind through the entire thing and you get strong enough to just plow through the end.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** Or you run for it and

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** You might make it.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** Sprint.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:19]** Yeah.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** Sprinted.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:20]** Which we did.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:20]** We made it.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:21]** We survived.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:22]** At least so far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** Here you are making fun of Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** And this was the right thing to do.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:30]** Sometimes you just gotta get away from the situation.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** And then come back.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** You run away.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:31]** You retreat.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** With some ammunition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:35]** The thing is that Thaddeus would stay in the fight, right?

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** He just would stay really far away from the fight.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** No, he comes back and steals the kill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** Let's not get on Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** Thank you.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:47]** Right as he's saying that, you're just slurping on that coffee.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:50]** Just like, it's really... Yeah, I'm going to leave that all in there.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** It's really nice.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Thank you for that.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** That was an aggressive slurp, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** Yeah, it was.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** Thank you.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** You drinking a milkshake?

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** Is that taro?

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** It's a salt coffee.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:03]** Salt coffee?

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** Salted coffee sounds good.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** I would love to try it.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:19]** Y'all, we have a request for banter from our dear friend Finder, who is gracing us with his presence for the third episode in a row.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** Unprecedented.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:24]** It's just because he's impatient and doesn't want to wait until the next one.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** That's it.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** He doesn't want to wait.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:28]** So he's going to stay tomorrow.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** We love you, Finder.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Yeah.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:31]** We do.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:36]** His banter suggestion for episode 109 is, what is your favorite 16-digit number?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:42]** I don't know if I have any numbers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** Does it start with a three, a four, or a five?

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:52]** That's the... Anyone who's keyed in cards knows what that joke is.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:56]** One is Master, one is Amex, and one is Visa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:15]** i'll do that much yep which one is discovery card seven or something uh i think discover is five what's one who's one i don't know that anyone is one someone was credit cards right starting could be with one


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:38]** oh the history of credit cards let's get into that before wow talk about master card is two or five oh discover is six there it is amex is three i'm a four with i am several solid four yeah four or five that ain't too bad you're you're you're a nine kevin at least oh yeah bad day are we literally talking about what credit cards we have


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** I was fine.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** You're doing this to us.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:45]** We're slowly revealing our secrets.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** It's terrible.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:50]** My favorite numbers, all of them are taxicab numbers.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:54]** And if you want to, it's a Ramanujan number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** So do the research.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** What's the TLDR?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:05]** There are these pairs of numbers that... No, I can just read it.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:12]** Defined as the smallest integer that can be expressed as the sum of two positive integer cubes in n distinct ways.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:20]** So the most famous one is 1729...

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:25]** which also equals like 1 cubed, 12 cubed, 9 cubed.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:28]** It's plus 10 cubed, I guess, is equal to 1729.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** So that's the taxicab note.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** I don't know.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:33]** Okay.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:37]** Speaking of numbers, I use RSA tokens for work.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:41]** I think my fifth RSA token now.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:43]** you guys know what RSA tokens are?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:57]** I have like five or six of them now on my it's an old school it's not low tech but it's an old school like MFA where it's pretty fascinating like the


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:07]** And I forget exactly how it works, but basically it's an algorithm that as long as you know which algorithm you're on and where you started, then these two numbers will correlate.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:14]** And so that's why if you put in your RSA token, the token is updating a certain sequence.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:19]** And so whatever you're putting it into knows which sequence you're on.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** It's called a rolling code.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** Yeah.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:21]** Right.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** That's cool.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** Funny enough, that's also how your garage door works.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** I don't know that.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:29]** Yeah, your garage door transmitter doesn't send the same code.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Right, good ones.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:36]** It sends a code and then it has the same algorithm that your garage door opener motor has.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:39]** And it's actually, it's unique to each remote.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:50]** So you have to sync your remote to the garage door, and that device will have its own rolling code that the garage door opener will expect the next time.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:53]** And the same goes for subsequent devices.

**[00:09:53 - 00:10:00]** So if you have more than one garage door opener, they'll transmit different signals but have the same input.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** Usually there's a sort of a grace period.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:08]** Like if you push the button once and it gets out of sync and push it a second time, that code will still work.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** Yeah.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** That's f***ing cool.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:18]** If you hit the button on your garage door, like outside of range, right?

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:24]** It'll go on... The device that you're using to open it will...

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** go to the next code.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:34]** And the way they get around that is basically the machine can figure out progressively what code it can expect.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:38]** So it can expect the third, the fifth, whatever code is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Yeah.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:39]** Yeah.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:39]** Yeah.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:40]** Yeah.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** That's some logic right there.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** That's some cool ass logic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:54]** Another fun fact is that all of this kind of, you know, the rolling code stuff, Bluetooth works the same way and GPS and all these other systems.

**[00:10:54 - 00:11:00]** They were, one of the key creators of it was an actress named Hedy Lamarr.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:00]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:24]** a lot of people don't realize that back when you know women were were not didn't even have the right to vote i believe at that time yeah 1940 or she was born in 1914. yes but they she helped create it for torpedoes during world war ii yeah you're welcome all your your technologies are because of warfare remember that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:54]** do y'all know the I guess yeah or yeah or that do y'all know how a right triangle whose two sides are the same length right so both sides are length one isosceles triangle the right hypotenuse is square root of two right that's the right one square root two I didn't know this until one of my math classes and I feel like a lot of my professors always would just drop like really dope

**[00:11:54 - 00:12:18]** math history during classes and would just be like do you know why this thing and this one i remember just being like really blew me away the reason why the square root of two is so wild is because it's an irrational number it's like the first number that you can't divide two numbers and get the square root of two there are no two numbers that you can do and get that number

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:28]** Just like such a simple thing when you think of our analog world going into that, it's like you have to use that function to the one-half power in order to get that number.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:29]** Wild.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** Math.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:32]** Math, dude.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** Cool.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** Thank you, Finder, for leading us down this cool little...

**[00:12:36 - 00:13:01]** math rocks this oh wow that was a good segue will that that one goes in the book i'm here kelly left kelly left at that one he said i don't i don't want to do that he's out he's like please i've had my soft coffee i've slurped it judgmentally and the last thing that i want to do right now is that in fact i want to drink some coke wash it down with some coke

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:12]** wash it down with some coke and uh yeah have a good time all right y'all let's play let's play i like this chill start to 109 things just kind of getting going


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:15]** Because a door opened.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** Zhang Duong.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** Zhang Duong.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:21]** He's drinking Zhang Duong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:21]** Oh.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** It's Coca-Cola.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:24]** Is there sugar?

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** I don't know.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:29]** Learn something new about math.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:32]** Learn something new about Vietnam.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:33]** That's it.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:37]** That's why you tune in for the banter here on We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** And for great segues.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** And to try to steal our information.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:44]** Actually, can I make a PSA?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** Yes, always.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:54]** I've seen this happen to my friends recently, so for those of you that are out there trying to financially prepare for the future...

**[00:13:54 - 00:14:07]** um every single time and i'm not going to give you specific investment advice even though really it's kind of basic but like i don't know like what the legal ramifications of it are do you know that over like 15 years

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:11]** Less than 15% of active managers beat the stock market.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** And over 30 years, it's statistically zero.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:18]** Do not ever go through active managers to ever manage your money ever.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** And do not trade yourself.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:24]** Like, because over like 30 years, you won't make it.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** It's statistically zero.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:32]** So I'm not going to say exactly what you need to look up, but stop giving money to people and paying people to underperform the stock market.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:40]** Because I'm talking to friends whose lives are getting ruined because they keep trying to beat the market and basically no one does it.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:44]** So for those of you that are out there, don't fall for that nonsense.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** It's all sales.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:47]** I don't know.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:57]** Look up Bogleheads.org or whatever and just be careful because very, very smart people are getting their asses handed to them and I'm tired of seeing it and having phone calls with people about it.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** And it sucks.

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** Sound advice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** That's very sound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:03]** Also, I am so sorry for them.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** Don't trust people with your money.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:06]** That's it.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** Don't trust authority.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:07]** It's your money.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:11]** Don't trust your GM when he says everything's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:18]** Kelly, that was a very real PSA for our very sci-fi fantasy world.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** So thank you for that.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:21]** It's important.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** That was a moment of realness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** That's why I put all my money under the mattress.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:36]** I really hope we don't get sponsored by like... This episode brought to you by... Both of whom did research.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:45]** I'm not advocating to trade stocks or anything, but at the same time, though, put money into your 401k.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:49]** Put money... Yeah.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:51]** Before this... Whatever you do with the 401k, that's different.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:52]** But here's the thing.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:55]** My company has fantastic matching.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** Fantastic matching.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:59]** Up to 10% matching for certain people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** WillSafe has match on 401ks?

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** Not WillSafe.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** That's what I wanted to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:06]** We'll see what we have for one day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:08]** All right.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** Let's get into playing.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:12]** I just want to be clear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** I'm not saying don't invest.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:19]** You should definitely, if you can, max out your tax advantage accounts and everything.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:24]** But I'm just saying, like, don't pay people to manage your money for you.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:25]** Sure.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** You know, like, just look up things.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:30]** This is not investment advice, but just look up index funds and stuff like that.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:33]** And, like, stop giving a bunch of you who's your money.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:34]** And with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** Thank you, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:36]** Thank you, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:51]** You should give your money to us by going over to our coffee and supporting our show to ensure that you get more non-financial advice.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** In the form of a Starfinder game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:03]** How many UPBs do we contribute to our 401ks in-game?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** This is a good question.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** Last time we found out a couple things.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:11]** One, that Terrapin Station is some sort of a communication.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** I'm going to take off this jacket.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** It's a nice jacket.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** Bullshit.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** It's hot.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:15]** Call him that one.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:18]** Is a communication station.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:19]** Nope.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:26]** We found out that there is a device, some sort of quantum synthesizer.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:28]** Something.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** Replicator.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:33]** up in the corner, up in the attic of the reactor.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:35]** Shay's little pet project.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:43]** We found out that Inspector Hurd has some sort of a pledge day party going on sometime tomorrow.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** Remember, this is like noon.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Starting to get a little into 1 p.m.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** in the afternoon.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** On day one.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** It was just yesterday that you arrived.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:56]** We found out that Rick19 is pretty good at sneaking.

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:58]** So is Bernice.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:02]** We also found out that Hears has a birthday coming up.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Happy birthday.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** It's not his birthday yet.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:05]** Right.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:10]** And if you're going to leave with that... Happy birthday to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:17]** That really needs to be something that you can... That's why everything feels so suspicious because they're trying to do a surprise party for him.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** Everybody's sneaking around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:23]** I think you're finally getting in on the second fold here, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:30]** finally dialing it in the conspiracy was to buy here's the perfect gift


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:34]** Let's jump over back into Tier Cal space here.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:53]** Game is paused because as we last left our crew, Bernice was peering around the corner, watching as Rick 19 in the restricted access area is looking to make his way into the open forum where Shay is talking with somebody.

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:00]** And right as that happens, we hear the door behind Bernice open.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** Before we get there.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** Brick19, you step up.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:10]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** Let's hear some more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:12]** Yep.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:13]** No, no, no.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** Take your time.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:16]** We have at least 40 more minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:19]** So, 19 perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:22]** 19 perception.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:28]** Right as you're walking up, give me a... Maybe a... What check would that be?

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:31]** Some sort of intelligence, maybe knowledge.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** Check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** Let me look and see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** What?

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Knowledge check?

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:38]** I don't have any knowledge.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:42]** Give me a... Culture check.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:43]** Culture.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:44]** Great.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Uh-huh.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:47]** 14.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** 14.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:49]** Okay.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:55]** You walk up and you see a Patra.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:56]** Okay.

**[00:19:56 - 00:20:02]** A female Patra standing next to Shay.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:09]** They are dressed in pretty slick steward's armor.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:12]** It's a bit of a different color.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** It's a little bit more black-ish.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** But they've modified it themselves.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** Probably not supposed to do that, but they have.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:29]** And they have got a very just severe, like serious look on their face at all times, even as they're laughing.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:32]** And when they laugh, it doesn't really look like they're laughing.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:35]** Kind of like cats don't really laugh or smile.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:41]** Can you show us their example of what that like me myself doing that?

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** Yeah.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** Show me a very serious.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:45]** Just like a very like you're not.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:49]** You know, it's like a little struggling, a little pain.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:54]** But as you walk up, Shay and this Patra were talking.

**[00:20:55 - 00:21:02]** And it sounded like they were talking maybe in Patra's native language.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Not sure.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:11]** And right as you walk up, the Patra sees you and just immediately is like...

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:12]** Hello.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** What are you doing?

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:17]** And then she goes, Hey, Rick.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:21]** Rick, why are you here?

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** Rick, what's going on here?

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:41]** And then you hear from behind you and you hear like a just like a banging against the wall and the door opens to that command center area behind you and you see that there is the Vlaka

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:57]** steward and the vlaka points at you and points to the to their left saying that you need to get out of here and shea kind of walks over and say come on let's let's let's go ahead and start heading back here you are not supposed to be back here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** My apologies.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:01]** I got kind of mixed up after I left Dr. Nodin's office.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:04]** I wasn't sure which way was the exit.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:06]** That's not very clear signs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:10]** We all know that it's a simple left to right, but it's fine.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:10]** It's okay.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:13]** And waits for you to start walking down the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** Can I roll another?

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** Was he the one sitting at the computer?

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:19]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:29]** you think that you don't know if they were sitting at the computer, but you could see that, that they were in that room and it doesn't look like a big room while you're rolling that perception.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:35]** Rather Bernice will do you have a question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:47]** Uh, hearing the commotion and, uh, Rick's discovery, I think, uh, Bernice is going to attempt to open the door to the doctor's quarters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:50]** Well, the door already opened behind Bernice, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** Which one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** The door opened behind you.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:52]** This one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:53]** Yeah.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** To the doctor's quarters.

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:00]** You hear, oh, what are you doing here, little one?

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:09]** And then reaches down to kind of direct you and say, I think we need to be going over here this way.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** Stab that bitch.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:18]** And tries to move you towards the door to your right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** And by that time, he started walking down the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:25]** No, he's like to the left, like back to the community area.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:50]** it's a rock rick by that time rick is like walking in the hallway and he goes uh excuse me and he reaches down and picks up bernice just like by the handle and grabs bernice and and asks dr notice which way is the way out and he kind of starts to shift towards the reactor hallway i think you know rick that's right down there and points to the end of the other hallway

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:56]** And he looks her in the face and he says, I'm not sure what I know and what I don't at this point.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:59]** And starts walking down the hallway.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:02]** Like, very clear message to her, saying that he doesn't trust her.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** That's a choice.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:09]** As she's walking away and Bernice is walking...

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** Bernice is in my hand.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** I'm carrying Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:14]** I can't move Bernice, by the way.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** It's not paused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** Yeah, you might need to refresh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:20]** I had Dr. OK selected.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:33]** You hear behind you as you're starting to walk out, you hear Dr. Nodens say, Rick19 presented as not knowing, like taking a verbal note of what you said.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:39]** And then as you look back down the hall, maybe as you're walking out, Sylvania steps off to the side to let you out.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:45]** You see just both Shay and Dr. Nodens just staring at you, Rick.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** You walking out on Foundry?

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** Because you're still inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** I'm trying to grab it.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** Fine, I step out.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:57]** I'm just going to nod at Shay and then step out and say, Dr. Okin, here's.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** It's good to see you again.

**[00:24:59 - 00:24:59]** Door shuts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:03]** Welcome back.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** I'm feeling disoriented.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** We're a little worried about you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:08]** I'm not going to lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:16]** I am uncertain of what is happening behind those doors, if that is any evidence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:39]** hearing familiar voices colin steps out to join the din zipping up his jacket i do love that i didn't mean to make it but colin thinks it was she just like brushes by him so slightly he's like oh hello hello there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:41]** Alright, that's what I like to see.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:43]** That's what I like to see.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:54]** Did any of you get asked extremely uncomfortable questions that basically have nothing to do with the greys or anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:58]** Because that's what happened to me with notice.

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:09]** Yes, I refused many of their questions on the basis that it was quite invasive for any normal...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:33]** interrogation or debrief i got asked about stuff from like 20 years ago and how i feel about so and so a person that i don't even see anymore how i feel about you guys and i almost felt like she was trying to turn us against each other with all kinds of weird things something not right with anyway this is obviously not right something's not right question


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:40]** Can you clarify your thought process there, Dr. O'Keefe?

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:44]** Are you assuming that there might be something wrong with us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:45]** I don't know.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:56]** Their questioning leads me to believe that they're investigating our past and taking tests.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** Maybe they don't know who we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:02]** Is it possible that we were targeted before?

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** I'd say... Targeted by who?

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:11]** That is... I... I am not certain if we were targeted by Greys.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:15]** We all ended up on that ship, and the four of us... Correction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** The three of us... The stewards led us onto that ship.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:21]** They greeted us at the door.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:25]** There was... foul about it.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** We all know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** Where is Colin?

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Colin's right here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** Yep.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:41]** You hear a soft... And you look over and you see that Sylvain is playing crosswords on her phone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:45]** She's like just trying to think through some crosswords.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** Sense motive on her.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** I got zero for sense motive.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** We'll see.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** On her playing crosswords?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** 13.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** I got nothing.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** I got a 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:16]** She seems like she is listening, but not like actively like she's there.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** You're talking about like, should we trust these people?

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:19]** I don't know.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** It's like, yeah, of course she's going to be like, what are they talking about?

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:26]** But she absentmindedly is also very involved in crosswords.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** And you recall that she's really good at crosswords.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** She's got a word all done.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:30]** She is.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** She is doing the daily crossword.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** It's got connections going.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** The full crossword.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** Oh, she already did connections first thing.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** She is doing the full crossword, right?

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:38]** Like, not the mini.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:45]** She's close enough to Rick that he looks over and says, fish is four down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:51]** Guys, what is the... She just scowls at you.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:53]** In the spangram, there is aluminum foil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:53 - 00:29:01]** Rick, I don't know if you know this, but most people who do crosswords don't like their puzzles being figured out for them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** She seemed like she was stuck on that one.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** I was just trying to assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** Did she say anything?

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:10]** No.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** She scowled, apparently.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:16]** She hasn't said anything the whole time, remember?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:19]** Dr. K, you made her laugh once.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:24]** And by laugh, I mean she just had a very neutral face and then just kind of smirked.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:27]** Did she say, hmm?


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:30]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:33]** Guys, what do you all want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** It's like 1230.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** I don't know if you heard, but there's going to be a ceremony.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:44]** Shay was telling me that there's like, what is it called?

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:48]** A reunification ceremony or recommitment ceremony or something like that.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:52]** There's like an anniversary of someone being a steward for like 10 years or whatever.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:57]** And by the way, there's some kind of device that replicates things that Shay showed me.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:59]** And he wanted me...

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:12]** to replicate some stuff but i i'm just i don't know if i we would we should trust what that is uh but sylvania like you you can tell that her eyes at that point are like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** I keep talking about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:20]** She's... You just met a game.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:27]** You just disclosed to an NPC that you had an accomplice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** You all can move.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:35]** We could, but we're just having this conversation in front of her for whatever reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:41]** I don't really... I honestly don't care that she has that.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** I feel like they probably do.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** Ha ha ha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:47]** We either have the best tactics in the world or the worst.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** Nowhere in between.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:51 - 00:31:02]** Is Pledge Day something common for... Is that a stewards-wide thing?

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:07]** Rick is fascinated with stewards.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** Is Pledge Day something he would be aware of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:15]** So then Rick would have responded to here as like, are you referring to Pudge Day?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** That's what it is.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** What is the plan, guys?

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** How much longer do we have to be here for?

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** It's all turning into a blur.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** Can we step into this room over here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:27]** Yes, when can we return on our voyage?

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:33]** Let's walk around the corner and talk loudly as we go around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** Come on, step right in here.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** What is this, a little briefing room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** Oh, hey, this is cool.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:44]** I feel like we should just commandeer a vehicle and get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:48]** All right, so we've entered some kind of briefing room, I guess.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:57]** Before Rick walks away, he glances down at the phone again and says, 18 across is Persephone, and then walks off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Rick's a mad lad.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:07]** All right, and Colin closes the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:11]** Should we blow this popsicle stand or what?

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:13]** What do you have in mind?

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:15]** Well, there's a ship out in that hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:16]** Aye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** Why don't we just take it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:22]** Are you curious to see the rest of this planet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:24]** Are you suggesting that we steal the ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** Borrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** I'm sure we'll bring it back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** Yeah.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:32]** It's got autopilot, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** We'll just come back.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:37]** I have to admit that I am concerned that there is something more than what is...

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:45]** in our purview, but I don't believe that stealing a ship is the proper course of action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** Yeah, fair enough.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** I can't remember what we're waiting for.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:52]** It's just been so long since I've been back to threefold.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:56]** I don't remember why we're, like, who are we waiting for and what.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:58]** Like, again, are we waiting to be released by the stewards?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** The stewards have brought you here.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:05]** The stewards have brought you here and have said, hey, we're going to debrief you.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:09]** We want to learn a bit more about what happened to you, where you're from.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** We don't like the greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** But they have great tech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** And we're going to ask you a couple questions.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** Again, this is the day after you got there.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** You got here, like, yesterday afternoon.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** Had dinner.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** Woke up this morning.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** Had been through everything.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:30]** So, conceivably, you're just kind of waiting to get, like, the release.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:32]** Yeah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:33]** You know, check out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:36]** Colin, were you about to say something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** I think he was about to say something.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:42]** I was trying to remember the conversation that Colin had with Kaniko in the gym.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:44]** You...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:49]** He doesn't remember much.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** He just remembers her touching him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:58]** It makes sense that you don't because you were like reading the situation totally differently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** Red flow redirected.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** You know, there was just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:11]** Rick, while he's thinking of that, Rick does say, like, I did notice something on the data pad in Dr. Nodin's office.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:16]** It said a patient was transferred from here to Terrapin Station.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:30]** And when I questioned Dr. Nodin, she seemed uncertain, but informed me that Terrapin Station is a communication station, which I don't understand why a patient would be transferred there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:37]** Unless they wanted that patient to communicate with someone, maybe, but that seems highly unlikely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:41]** Is that stationed on this planet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:43]** That I am not certain of.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:49]** What did the Peritons say about a second base on this planet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:54]** I think there's a prison that they've got to assist with sometimes.

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:00]** Should we, you know, hop in some sort of vehicle and go check it out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** Are you suggesting that we steal a vehicle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:06]** We could ask, but I don't expect them to say yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** Again, with this stealing tone.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:16]** Rick, simply borrowing someone's vehicle while we're stranded in... Well, I mean...

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:17]** It's a necessity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:27]** Colin, you remember that Kaniko said to you, and she seemed very paranoid as well.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:35]** She was trying to keep up appearances, talk normally, and then whisper things to you.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:39]** She's a little concerned about Officer Astara's behavior.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** That's the Vlaka.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** About her behavior.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:45]** She doesn't come out when guests arrive.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:51]** She smelled like incense, which is not something she's ever smelled before.

**[00:35:54 - 00:36:00]** I don't know if you asked her more about that or if you want to ask her more about that particular thing.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** I'm just realizing.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:06]** She also said, you recall that Vlachas are usually either deaf or blind.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:11]** And she knows that Officer Astara is deaf.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:13]** And then she started to say something and that's when you got interrupted.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Gotcha.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** And Rick19...

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** Oh, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:25]** I was just going to see, like, okay, maybe we should go find her and bring her into this sidebar so that we can all come up with a plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:29]** Is this room mic'd?

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** Like, can we do it?

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** Yeah.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:32]** Is it bugged?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** You want to give me perception?

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:38]** Good.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** Why can't I do math?

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:42]** 27.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:44]** Good roll.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** You don't find anything.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:49]** You don't find any mic or cameras or anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:51]** Well, we're safe to talk in here, it seems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:58]** Let me go grab Keniko and we'll see which way is up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:00]** We'll do an interrogation of our own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:04]** So he goes looking for Keniko first in the gym, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Okay.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Yeah.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** Oh, look.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** She's there.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** She was jogging.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** Hi there.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:17]** Can you go and call and bless us a little bit?

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:20]** We're having a quick chat in the briefing room.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:26]** I don't know how close to done you are, but we could use your input if that's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:31]** She is just super focused and there's no mirror in front of the one that she's running in front of.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:36]** And so it's just... And you just hear loud music in her headphones.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** So she did not hear what you were saying.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** She's not doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:44]** And you just... You recognize... Or all you can focus on is the sweat dripping down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:49]** I don't know how I feel about this.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** I feel like...

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:56]** Well, I want to, I want to be on Colin's side.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** So I want to ship him with someone good.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:03]** Like if this is, if this is really what he wants, then I can, I can officially ship it.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:05]** But I got to like observe a little bit too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:10]** She is the only steward that's come out on our side so far.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** And she's not a steward, right?

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** She's a Puritan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:12]** Right.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** She's a Puritan.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:20]** He like awkwardly hops onto the treadmill next to her and like tries to wave to get her attention.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** Yeah, and she's, like... She's, like, keeping pace.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** She's, like, hey.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Yeah, and she keeps running.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:28]** Gives the universal, like, headphones off for a moment sign.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:30]** Yeah, hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:33]** And, like, jumps, puts her feet on either side of the treadmill.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** Just pushes pause for a second.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** Hey.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:37]** What's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** We had a nice chat earlier, I thought.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** Did you?

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:44]** Never mind.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:50]** We're having a little powwow in the briefing room and could freely use your input.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:56]** I don't know how long you've got here, but if you could join us quick as you like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:58]** Yeah.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:58]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** Let me just.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** Let's go now.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:06]** And just kind of hops off and starts following you.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:11]** She's like turning off the music and you hear that she was listening to some like super hardcore stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Hardcore what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:14]** Like metal.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:19]** Super intense stuff.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:23]** Is this a door opened or a door closed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:23]** Door closed.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** For sure.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:25]** All right.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:27]** Oh, you're all in here.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:28]** Oh, okay.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** Hello.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** Hello.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:51]** hello everyone she like she's clearly smart enough to understand that she's just walking in just like super sweaty and like aware of appearance doesn't care too much but it's like okay uh this really is spur of the moment like she understands like all right what's you can tell that she's like ready to get down to business what's going on


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:56]** We're trying to figure out what's going on here.

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:00]** How much danger we're in, which way is up.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:05]** You were telling me about the vlog earlier, the captain something or other?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:09]** She kind of looks around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:13]** To space your concerns, we've checked the room for bugs.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:16]** This is a private... Have you really checked?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:20]** Uh, I mean, I'm happy to check again.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:23]** I guess I can help, like, be 100% sure, but I do trust the doctor.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:26]** Uh, I mean, yours is pretty good at this kind of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:31]** I was pretty confident, but... Then I trust you, doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** Then I trust you.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:37]** I'm capable of breaking whatever device could be listening to us.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:40]** Yeah, but that doesn't help after the fact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:40]** Thank you for your help, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Thank you.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** That's good.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:49]** Everyone stop trying to impress Konigo and let Colin have his thing, all right?

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:54]** I mean, it kind of gives you like a smile here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:55 - 00:41:00]** I'm sorry, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:07]** Look, I was concerned as I told Colin.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:10]** Officer Astara is Inspector Hertz.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** Right hand.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** Knows about everything that happens here.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** Oversees all of it.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** Why would she come out to greet you?

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** No offense.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** She's never done that before.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:28]** I think that speaks to who you are.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:33]** I've come back here before, never gotten a greeting from her.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:41]** Also, again, weird thing, she smelled like smoke, like incense.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:47]** She does not seem like the type of person to be, you know...

**[00:41:47 - 00:42:17]** having something going on here and I don't know exactly what they have back there but I know they have a couple different rooms so I don't know what's what's happening it was real like pungent little like rosy smelled good but just sticks with you and sits with you everyone give me a mysticism check I am on it I don't have mysticism oh I do have mysticism 27 can I assist


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:18]** I'm a mystic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** I don't assume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** 27?

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** Dr. K, you might also know about this just from maybe like a culture.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** If you want to roll back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:30]** Ivy Collins, Mississippi.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:34]** 22.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** You all remember...

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:44]** that this scent of incense, you haven't smelled it.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:53]** So you don't know, but you're aware enough to think the only place that has that kind of scent that I've heard, it like sticks to you.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:53]** It smells good.

**[00:42:53 - 00:43:00]** You like it, but it stays with you as if it's like lingering on you in like a, in like a good way.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:06]** The only times that you've seen that are when you've gone to houses of worship for Yomadai.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** Uh,

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** Right, I'm trying to remember.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:16]** That's not the... Please don't let it be who I think it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:20]** Oh, it's a Patreon goddess of humanity.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:22]** You sound like you should be a Starfinder story time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** I'm ready for one if we need it.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** We haven't done one in a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:27]** Starfinder story time!

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** I got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:36]** Do we... I can give you the drop in... Not right now, but... In the post?

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Take it away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** Stop.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** Stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** I might have it.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:43]** Do I have it?

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** Do I have it?

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:44]** Where is it?

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** Where is it?

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:46]** Sorry.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:47]** No, I don't have it.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** Wait, drops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:48]** Hold on.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** John's failing us.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** Put it in post, dude.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** No, no, no.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** I'm not failing you.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** I'm super cool.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** You are, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:54]** It's okay.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:57]** Not everyone can perform the drop of a hat.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:57]** Yeah, no, it's good.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:59]** There's nothing wrong with that.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** I can't find it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** Just come back to it later.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:02]** All right.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** Be patient.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:03]** Yep.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Yeah, no, for sure.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** Okay.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:06]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** All right, take it away.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Wait, is the drop going to happen?

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** No.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** No, it's in public.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** We're going to put it in space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:36]** all right all right all right tell us was a mortal woman from the lost planet of galarian who ascended to divinity centuries before the start of the gap after the world's disappearance she became the patron goddess of humanity and began to be called the spirit of galarian spirit of galarian i'm not putting the right inflection on these things

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:48]** Iomedai remains a warrior for good who embodies the virtues of glory, honor, justice, strength, and valor, and who strives against the greatest evils facing the Pact World system.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:58]** Basically, the financial and religious support of the Church of Yeomadai was instrumental in supporting the formation of the Pact World's government and the signing of the Absalom Pact.

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:08]** So she's like martial and compassionate and expects her followers to exercise courtesy with one another and a proponent for universal justice.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:13]** So I guess like sort of like a paladin-esque like kind of kind of thing.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:17]** Not really giving us any kind of evil vibes there.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** It's all good stuff.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** Oh, well, now it happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:23]** Hey, you know how we talked about the timing of dad jokes?

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** Yeah.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:29]** That, that was, that was the truth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:38]** Oh, I wonder if, uh, so, um, yeah, anyway, I, it's just, she's the church of Yomadai sponsors, nightly orders and so on.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** It's basically, it reminds me of paladins.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** That's how I kind of think about it.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:48]** And so I wonder if this might be their patron patron God, although she was mortal in the time of pathfinder.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:51]** So I don't know if there's paladins and star finder or not, but there you go.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:53]** That's my very unlettered expo.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** Lawful good alignments.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:55]** Nothing bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:00]** I'm sorry.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:02]** Who is the person who smelt like this?

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** The Vlaka.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:09]** It's pretty uncommon, no, for Vlakas to worship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:09]** Yeah.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:13]** She's more for like Vesks, Kasathans, and humans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:15]** Or is that just me reading into it?

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:20]** Kasatha, human, and Besk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** That's what I see.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:22]** It's not unheard of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:27]** There's nothing sus about being... Not at all.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:34]** But there's sus about Avlaka being a follower of Iomidae.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:36]** I mean, maybe I'm reading too much into it.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** I don't know.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:44]** I just saw that on the archives of Nethis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:46]** It's a very valid question.

**[00:46:47 - 00:47:00]** And I think the other thing to remember is that Vlachas, I'm going back to when I was walking through this, Vlachas live on a planet called Mars.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** Lajok is how I pronounce it.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** L-A-J-O-K.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:09]** The sun for Lajok, soda, that's the name of the sun, is dying.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:16]** So the planet is slowly, very slowly getting increasingly cold, longer winters.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:19]** Vegetation is dying, right?

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:20]** Right.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:31]** And so, like, Lajak's cities are like that game, like, was it Frostpunk, where, like, you have to build cities very close together with a lot of heat, right?

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:35]** And the outer rings are kind of the defense against winter.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** So it just...

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:42]** It just seems a little odd, sure, that they would be worshipping Yomedai.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** Who's to say?

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:49]** Maybe there's a particular group of people that were very, yeah, that felt very touched by it.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:51]** But you're right.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:53]** It does seem a little odd.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:53]** It's like, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:58]** Would this Vlaka secretly be one of the Knights of Galerion?

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:02]** Because that's probably the most notable organization that follows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** She's a steward, correct?

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** The Vlaka?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** Yeah, she's a steward.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:17]** You also remember that Vlaka, and this is what Kaniko says, two-thirds of them are born blind or deaf.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:22]** And so I believe Officer Astara is deaf.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:35]** And you recall that Officer Stara points and didn't say anything to you and just pounded on the door and then pointed and then said that you should get out.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:38]** It was signing that they should or that you should.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:46]** The important thing here, though, is that Kaniko says, but the thing is.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:58]** I could have sworn that I heard or I saw Officer Astara turn when you here introduced yourself.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** Maybe she just saw him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:07]** But, like, okay, one that makes Hears feel better, because, like, Hears is like, oh, I guess she wasn't just me, which is kind of nice.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:12]** But, like, maybe she... Well, she is rude, so... Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** In general, she's rude.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:19]** She could be a lawful, good paladin, but she's just rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:25]** I mean, it could also be that, like, telepathy is effective where audible sound isn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:49]** oh or it could be that the gm is trying to tell us that the vlaka is not dead question have you all seen anything here pause for laughter have you all seen anything unusual here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:52]** Yeah, every single time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:55]** It feels weird this time that I've been here.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** Something feels off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:58]** I don't have anything to compare it to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:00]** What have you seen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:06]** But I'm a little unnerved by, well, what we just experienced.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** What was that?

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** Sheila sits down.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:11]** She's listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:13]** Were the Peritons questioned by Dr. Nodens?

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:17]** They have been in the past.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:17]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:24]** Do they ask you about your childhood or your upbringing or anything about your past?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:25]** No, not at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** Yeah.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:31]** For us, it seems that's not the case.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:39]** In fact, she was very prying into both what I've worked on back home on Pabock.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:42]** And my associations with these?

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** Fine, folk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:59]** She was asking me about which weapons I brought to Omicron and which weapons I carried out, which confused me because I never intended to be on Outpost Omicron in the first place.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:02]** How did she know about- And I was thankful for the weapons I had at the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** Sorry, repeat that?

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** She was asking about weapons that you had with you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:37]** yes that was just a small amount of the questions that she was asking was about which weapons i carried on to the ship that ended up being the ship adopted by the grays and she was asking about my affiliation to other organizations which i'm not sure if i tr if it is not apparent but i am a member of the android abolition front being an android myself i think that is

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** Acceptable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:39]** Okay.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** Okay.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:44]** Yeah, I mean, that's not unusual.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** Kudos to you.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** That's good work that you do.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:55]** But the weapons, the backstories, that's all strange.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** She's never asked that.

**[00:51:56 - 00:52:05]** Look, it doesn't sound out of the realm of possibility, I guess, because they don't know you, like you haven't been vetted, right?

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:08]** In the same way that we have, because we were hired.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:13]** But it just, something about that doesn't sit right.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:19]** It feels like they're trying to get a narrative of you leading questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:21]** Is that right?

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** That's how it feels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** Am I hearing you all right?

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:24]** Okay.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:31]** Colin, here's, do you have any more insight on the questions that Nodens was asking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:35]** She, yeah, she would ask.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:39]** No, she would just be like, well, we had one of our party die.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:41]** And she'd be like, do you feel responsible for that?

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** Do you feel guilty for that?

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Tell me about your family.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:49]** Tell me about things that have nothing, whatever to do with the grays, which is ostensibly what we are being interviewed for.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** I don't know.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** It's also just the general feeling and vibe.

**[00:52:53 - 00:53:00]** And when you say the air, Koniko, you mean just how awkward and strange everything is and how it just doesn't seem right, correct?

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:01]** Right.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** Yeah.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:04]** And Orvier seems weird.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:07]** I haven't seen much of Orvier.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** Is it normally not like this?

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** Is this a recent phenomenon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:15]** The last time that we were here was a while back.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** It's been a few drops.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:19]** I don't remember being like this.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** It was pretty quick.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** We were here for a day or two.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** Then we left.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:25]** Everything was hunky-dory.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** People were about the same.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:32]** Sylvania was still doing her crosswords, and Red was still very great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:34]** I'm glad that that hasn't changed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:37]** Yeah, but the air was a little...

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** I just expect a little more from a steward's base.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:54]** Like, I just expect a little more hospitality and rules and clearance and something here feels loose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:54]** I don't know what it is.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** Are you saying that there is a breakdown in leadership?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** Not necessarily.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** Heard is an asshole like always.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** I didn't mean to ping on the map there.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:06]** I... I... Or did he...

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** I could see that.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** I don't know what they would be.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** They're the same.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:15]** I've so far seen the same people.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:24]** Is there anything I can... Look, it feels a little bit like we need to...

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:28]** Like, we need to do a little research.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:33]** I think we need to take our fates into our hands here.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:36]** Like, this doesn't feel right.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:43]** And I'm telling you, this is somebody who has been with the Pykes Peritons, with Orvier, since the beginning.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:45]** And there's something that doesn't feel right.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:47]** And it happened when we found you.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** And that set off something.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** And it's changed.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:54]** Do you trust the Peritons?


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:55 - 00:55:00]** I trust my Peritons that I am responsible for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:04]** Even after they turned on us aboard the Void Crier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:06]** Yes.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** I am responsible for their safety.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:13]** I don't think that that was them.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:19]** The person I don't trust is Orvir.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:22]** Why?

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:22]** Why?

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** Call it gut feeling.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:30]** Call it the way that he heads back into his room.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:35]** Call it the way that I see him head over into the restricted area.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:40]** Call it the way that he hasn't really used his office.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** She points next to her.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Something about it.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:49]** And again, this is somebody who I've put my life in their hands.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:52]** And just something feels weird.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:58]** I wouldn't tell you this if I wasn't confiding you knew or didn't think that there was something seriously wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:08]** Was there anything from Orvier prior to the events on Outpost Omicron that would lead you to question his leadership?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:13]** No, I mean, he was pretty by the book, like we follow the stewards.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:16]** When did it change?

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** When did it change?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** Didn't you answer that already?

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** When we got picked up, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:34]** Yeah, but I guess come to think of it, I met Orvir as we're about to go to this outpost Omicron, right?

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** Orvir already knew the mission.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:38]** I...

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** He was fine then.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:43]** He's been fine in his command.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** I'm his second in command.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:51]** We're supposed to follow the stewards, but really the Pikes Perchins follow me and Orvia, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** Colin or Vinny?

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:57]** Kev, did you share about the replicator with the rest of the party already?

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** That would be here.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** That would be mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** He just said it out loud to Kaniko.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:02]** Yeah.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:27]** um why is that so here's a quick question i mean you said it within an air shot of an npc that's fine but like they all know that it exists it's just a thing they have on their show but they don't know that we know that it exists literally shade just whatever all right i really don't question here's um how likely is it that that um replicator could create could copy organic matter


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:31]** Can you repeat what you just said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:36]** How likely is it that that replicator you saw could copy organic matter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:40]** Here's, we'll roll an engineering check, I guess, of 420.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:41]** Sure.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:47]** Are you suggesting that the synthesizer that Hears is speaking of is some kind of cloning device?

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** You don't think...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:55]** I'm... So here's the situation.

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:00]** Anyways, here's... You got it.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:07]** We're on a base surrounded by supposedly good guys that we don't trust.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:20]** They've got some sort of replicator which, based on what you've told us here, is probably grey technology based on having some sort of

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:42]** telepathic interface I think that's a fair assumption based on everything else we've seen thus far it sounds mean that is a strong inference though this is Kevin talking this is yeah this is correlation this is not causation but this it's I mean the shoe fits

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:57]** And so if they've somehow, after they abducted us from the ship, maybe they replaced Orvir with a doppelganger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** Yeah, I see.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:04]** You don't think, Kiers, that this device, given its size and power...

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:15]** And the way it works, you don't think that organic matter is its main purpose, nor would it really be able to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:21]** Looking at what I saw of the machine because of its size...

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:24]** And other aspects of it.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:30]** I don't think it could clone someone like our size, you know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:31]** Gotcha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:35]** Do you think it's linked to the greys, though?

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:41]** I think that's possible, because it can be controlled via telepathy, and...

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** you know.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** Who else would?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:45]** This is a revelation.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:46]** I didn't know about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** I need a sense motive on her.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** I have zero sense motive.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** That's fine.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** I'll do a sense motive.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:54]** Okay, good, because I can't even flip a diary now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:55]** 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:57]** Oh, it's a natural 20, though.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** So I got 20.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** 20?

**[00:59:59 - 00:59:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** I got a 13.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** You got a 13?

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:06]** Plus my... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:06]** Plus 50.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:09]** So I assist Dr. O. I'm going to do it again.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** I don't assist.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:12]** Love it.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** Okay, we got an assist.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:17]** We got... 21.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:17]** Okay.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** Would have been a 30.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** 28.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** Oh, well.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:25]** Rick, you're not sure entirely, but you have the same sense that Dr. O.K.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** and...

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:31]** Kiers and Colin do, which is that she seems shooketh in the same way that you are.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:37]** For her to come share this with you, she is very genuine about this.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:40]** She doesn't seem like she's trying to like lead you on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:43]** What's next for us, Koniko?

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:46]** So we basically had our exit interview.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** We kind of want to get on, you know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:50]** Well, I'm not going to lie.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:54]** I've never liked Dr. Nodens.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** Shocker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:58]** A little too eager.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:02]** I mean, she looks a little bit like a Disney villain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:02]** Doesn't she?

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** I don't know what Disney is, but doesn't she?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** I don't either, but I've heard it used.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** Yeah, right.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:09]** I've heard that term used.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** We could be using it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:12]** I feel like they used to make good movies, but.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:14]** Maybe, perhaps.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:18]** Look, we need an action and we need an exit strategy.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:24]** If our findings, let's call it, point that we need to get out.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:25]** That's the sense.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:27]** That's where I'm at.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** And I'm being transparent with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:29]** I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:37]** My responsibility is to my crew, the Peritons, and by extension also to you.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:44]** And I want to help you because the experience that you're having, the experience that I'm having, it doesn't line up.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:47]** I've been here a lot.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:49]** And by a lot, I mean like two or three times.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:52]** But I have been back in the restricted area before.

**[01:01:53 - 01:02:00]** And I know some things about, you know, Tercalus and Pharos from just being here.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:06]** So I think between what I know, between your capabilities, if we need to figure out an exit plan, we could.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:10]** What do you know of Terrapin Station?

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:16]** She snaps her fingers and she's like, that's the name.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:21]** I do know that there is some sort of communication station.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:50]** outside of Terrapin and the communications here at your catalyst are incredibly secure everything that leaves to your catalyst only goes to Terrapin and it's from some like you know there's there's there's some command center console place where everything runs through right Terrapin station is miles away

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:53]** And Varos, as you know, sucks.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:56]** Like, not a place you want to walk.

**[01:02:56 - 01:03:00]** So that is very far away.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:04]** But before we get there, this is what I'm thinking.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:10]** There's some sort of party or something tomorrow, right?

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:11]** The Pledge Day.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:12]** Pledge Day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:13]** We can slip about.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:18]** I think that might be...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:29]** I think that might be a chance to maybe, you know, I'm sure they're going to do something as well for themselves privately, but like, you know, there's probably going to be some sort of little public thing.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:35]** I'm thinking that's a time to do some more exploration.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:36]** Here's something else.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:41]** I asked, are you sure that we are not alone in here?

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:53]** And I would encourage you to apply that same discrimination of the spaces that you're in to every space that you go in, wherever that may be.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:57]** You mean within the station?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:01]** It just doesn't feel right.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:24]** right you know don't be paranoid or anything but like be paranoid yeah that's literally what you've i'm also is that your answer finder is that you want to hear here's just just go with the flow don't just trust people man i up until this conversation sink in my chair up until this conversation

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:30]** I was, I was concerned enough about small signs.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:38]** So I asked Colin, I saw you calling and I said, Hey, let me ask you, I wasn't ready to maybe leave.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:40]** Like I've just explained to you.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:46]** The reason I wasn't until just now is because of what you saw.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:52]** Here's that, that this replicator thing.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:54]** Was it green?

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** It had like a green light coming out of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:59 - 01:04:59]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:02]** Yeah.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:03]** What do you know of it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:07]** That is... Hate you, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:12]** That is... If the next two words out of your mouth are our game...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:18]** and he's going to fly over here.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:18]** He's going to fly to LA.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:23]** He's going to stay at my house and we're going to go over there and we're going to kick your ass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:29]** I wouldn't do that to you.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** Yeah, don't worry.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:36]** Shay told me he wasn't going to take it.

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:40]** Shay said, wow, this is cool.

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:43]** And I'm like, let's get going.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** He's like, yeah, of course, let's go.

**[01:05:46 - 01:06:04]** that is some sort of gray technology huh that was on outpost omicron oh and it was in a room where there were weapons and random devices that nobody and this flux of

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:26]** of like of green light and energy and it didn't i didn't like it there was something else there why build an entire large room dedicated to this if you're just gonna leave it and the grays are whimsy and capricious as f**k but why build all of that

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:29]** And then just be willing to walk away.

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:32]** And then why did Shay take it?
