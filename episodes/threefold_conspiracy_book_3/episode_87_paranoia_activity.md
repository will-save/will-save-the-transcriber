**[00:00:00 - 00:00:10]** Hello friends.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:23]** You have come to the right place at the right time.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:27]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:27]** We'll Save!

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:27]** We'll Save!

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:27]** We'll Save!

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:31]** I am your military GM, John Swan.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:33]** Military in the Starfinder sense.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:35]** And I have a question for you.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:38]** In what Olympic sport would you compete in?

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** If you had to compete.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:43]** If somebody was like, you need to go right now, but you can pick any one that you want.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:46]** And they were like, I don't know why I'm picking you, but I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** What would you choose?

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:51]** I've actually heard a bit about this model.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** Summer or winter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** Whichever one you want.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:55]** Any?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:02]** I buy into the idea that the Olympics shouldn't just be the best of the best.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:04]** It should be a random selection.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:27]** yeah i like that yeah totally um i would want to compete in curling curling i think the people who compete in olympic curling are probably the dopest people in the olympic village and so like just spending a week with those cats like yes that'd be they're they're the drunk dads in the neighborhood those are my people


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:29]** Yeah, they're just like crushing beers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:33]** It's like, why would, why would I play that any differently?

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:39]** They need to have like washers be an Olympic sport or like washers, washers.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** What do you mean?

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** Like the washers, like lawn sport.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:45]** You mean pogs?

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** I know what you were talking about.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** It's sort of like quarters.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** Yeah.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** But what is quarters?


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:56]** These are all like dad.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** These must be dad things.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:59]** Tell me you didn't grow up in the hood without telling me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:09]** It's like cornhole, but like a little bit more sophisticated slash who really owns beanbags?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** Vinny, are you saying that you grew up in the hood in Ireland?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** You make your own washer board.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:19]** I'm saying that we had a lot of overlapping circles, but it wasn't a perfect circle.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** Totally agree.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** It didn't overlap at all.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:22]** That's very true.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:29]** So quarters is like you and your buddies go up to a wall and you compete.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:31]** You throw quarters at the wall.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:35]** Whoever's quarter gets closest to the wall gets all the quarters.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** It's a gambling game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:38]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:43]** It's actually an ancient game, believe it or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Next time Kev is in Talents, let's play.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:47]** And Will is probably going to win because he's been playing it since antiquity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:51]** Will started the game in 3000 BC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:56]** Actually, they think it was... They used to call it Shekels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** No, it was casting lots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:03]** Like when you would cast lot, like you would play like that basically.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:06]** And then whoever wins, wins whatever is at stake.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** But yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** So what would you play, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:11]** Well, if it was going to be winter games, I would be doing curling.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:14]** And if it's summer, I would do dressage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** Oh, is that the horse thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** The horse dancing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:18]** The equestrian?

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:19]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** The horse dancing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** Horse dancing, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** I would love to see.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:29]** I would pay so much money to see Will do horse dancing.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** Yeah, like equestrian sports.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** Can we make this a goal?

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** Can we add this to our coffee?

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:37]** Just like Will horse dancing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:40]** Will takes dressage lessons and we film it.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** And I'm down.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** I am down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:45]** There are a lot of ranches out here in California.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** A man and his horse.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** Yes.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** That would be amazing to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:49]** That would be amazing.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** You probably pick up real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:56]** I actually really like, um, there's like, uh, have you ever ridden a horse?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:56]** I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** Yeah.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:57]** Okay.

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:00]** Not like he's like, I've never done dressage.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** If that's what you mean.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** But yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:04]** He's like, but I fired and I've shot guns.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:06]** I've taken a horse in a battle a few times.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Uh, naturally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:36]** do you find it easier or more difficult to control the horse when they're armored as well i'm thinking like medieval you know times yeah it's tough yeah um i feel like it's easier they feel more planted with armor when you're going into to battle uh when you're facing barbarian hordes um sure having an armored horse is like having a you know it's like a small tank cool awesome wisdom from william i like it will's wisdom


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:38]** Will's wisdom throughout the ages.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** Throughout the ages, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** Exactly.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** Kelly?

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:42]** Winter?

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:45]** I feel like for sure it would be dog sled racing.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** Is that a sport?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** Is that an Olympic sport?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:49]** It is.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** I bet dog sled.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:53]** Yeah, dog sled racing is an Olympic sport.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** No, no, no.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** Like dogs.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:58]** Like, you know, like the Iditarod, but like the Olympics version.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:02]** So that for me, I would be very happy to do it.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** Yeah.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** Always wanted to do it.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** Always wanted to race the Iditarod.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** So I would do it without.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** That's super rad.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** Can I do that with you?

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** That would be so cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** That would be fun.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** There's like a team.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** We could do it together.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** I think there's like two people that do it maybe.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** Do they do like relays?

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:20]** I don't know how it's structured for the Olympics.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** Maybe it's not like a multi-day thing like the Iditarod.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:26]** I'm not sure, but I'm so ready for that.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** You're so ready.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:32]** Also, I have to prove to some people that I can do it too because some people were like, you could never win a dogfight race.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** You told us about this.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** You told us about this.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** Also, you have to prove it to the Blanco.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:37]** Who told you that?

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** I forget about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:40]** I mean... My family.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** It was your family, right?

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:47]** This feels like a really weird, like, gauntlet to be thrown down.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** Like, it's oddly specific.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:49]** Yeah, one day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** They're gonna see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** You will see.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:52]** One day.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** It's gonna happen.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** Yeah.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:57]** That'll be our goal after Will's dressage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:59]** Long Beach, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:15]** I mean, it reminds me of the time that I had to, I actually, I was like, you know, some of my family was like heavily in debt and I registered for a dog sled race to win $10,000.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** Did you do this?

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** Oh, okay.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** Did you compete in it?

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** Yeah, yeah, I won.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** Is this the plot to Balto?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:29]** I think it's the plot of Iron Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** Thank you for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** Thank you for that.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:33]** That's good.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** That's good, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:47]** I was initially barred when I tried to enter the race, and then I had to prove I could compete somehow, and then a reporter came around and was like, yo, this guy's the real deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** And lo and behold, you won.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** And then I won.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** Yeah, many lies.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** Kev?

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:58]** Man, I honestly would want to try everything, because why not?

**[00:07:59 - 00:07:59]** Um...

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:02]** I'm trying to think of what I'd actually be good at.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:06]** And the biathlon, the winter biathlon, is that what it's called?

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** Yeah.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Long ski and then shoot.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** That was my winter choice, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** That would be fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** I'm super lazy, though.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** I wouldn't be good enough to train.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:15]** I wouldn't train for anything.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** So I'd have to be just naturally good at it in order to be competitive.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** And that's not going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** I think Kev would be like, hey, what's up?

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** And then he'd be like, all right.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** Cool, let's go.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:30]** He'd just like throw down like a quick stretch and be like, all right, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** I've never done this before.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:32]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:34]** Sir, you have your skis on backward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** They're on the wrong foot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** But I get bronze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** Who cares?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:43]** And then you can say that you got bronze in the Olympics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** I'll let you do that.

**[00:08:44 - 00:09:03]** that's a big deal trying to think summer sports like i i kind of do wish uh i i like in high school i wish i would have done more and including uh like running hurdles i think i could have been pretty good at running hurdles running was the one thing that i could do that really well like naturally everything else i'm not so sure but running yeah that's one thing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** What did you run, Kelly?

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:07]** Did you use trackers?

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:11]** You know how there's... Well, they're nonsense awards, I think, probably.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:16]** But the government gives out a little thing if you can run a quarter mile or a mile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:18]** Yeah, the Presidential Physical Fitness Awards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** Yeah, something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** Was that the government?

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** I thought that was the school.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** That was the government.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** I don't know what president put it together.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:29]** I believe it was Taft.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:32]** I think it was before that.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:35]** I think it was... Before Taft?

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** No, no, no.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** Not before Taft.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:38]** Not before Taft.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:39]** Sorry.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** I think it was JFK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:44]** Which president did you advise to put this in?

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:45 - 00:10:01]** I mean, it went through many, many iterations over time, but I think it was part of the, this particular one was like in the Red Scare era, but like it was supposed to be like a positive thing for like nation building or whatever.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** What is this?

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:05]** The Presidential Physical Fitness Award?

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:05]** Yeah.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:08]** I do remember this, but I thought it was just a school thing.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:39]** Could not do a single pull-up.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:44]** Took like a full 20 minutes to walk the mile.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:45]** You're right, it was.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** Yeah.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:50]** The V-sit was like... Oh, the V-sit.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:51]** Yep.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** You had to come with so many inches of the bottom of your feet.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:58]** And like when you're over six feet, it's just silly.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** At like fifth grade, fourth grade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** You put your hands together and you have to push the thing.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** Oh, that was the worst.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** That was the thing.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** That was the V-sit.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** Yeah.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:11]** I don't think I could do a single push-up back then.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** I was in terrible shape as a child.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:18]** I'm still not in great shape, but I'm in far better shape than I was then, I guess.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** I think you're in pretty good shape now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** Yeah.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** Yeah, I'm in decent shape.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:25]** What is... You've got to define...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:42]** decent shape is different for everybody i mean if kennedy can define decent shape then you can too yeah or it was it was nixon in this case so yeah for sure like it was actually he did it in 56 they instituted it yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:46]** Yeah, but Nixon chaired it, apparently, which is funny.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** Well, thanks, Nixon.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:53]** You opened up China and then did that, and then I think you brought an end to the Vietnam War.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** There were some good things that came out of that.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:57]** Okay, Nixon was Watergate, right?

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:58]** Yeah.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** Okay, cool.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** Just making sure.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:06]** Just making sure that you were detecting the hesitancy in Kelly's tone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:13]** So JFK is credited with bringing in a new era.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:18]** So it's changed over many years, the physical fitness says.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:25]** So from the Kennedy to Bush era was marked with like...

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:34]** There's, like, different... They just basically, like, they're trying to promote, like, outdoor activities and, like, physical health and stuff.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:34]** Yep.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:42]** He published an article in Youth Physical Fitness entitled The Soft American.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** Oh, God.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** What a name.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** Bush did?

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:46]** What a name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:50]** No, Kennedy in Sports Illustrated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** Got it.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** The Soft American.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:52 - 00:13:01]** He fed Cold War paranoia about American subservience, articulating concerns about children spending too much time watching television.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:02]** Classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:05]** JFK was a master of television, too.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** So that says something in a way.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** But like, yeah.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:13]** You know who else is a master of television?

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** We are!

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** Yay!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:20]** Digital, I mean YouTube and Twitch.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** Yeah, I mean digital, yeah, totally.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** We could be on TV one day.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:26]** Whoa, it's like you're in the ring and I'm reaching through your TV.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:31]** I was going to make a joke about like, hey, speaking of like body shapes and stuff, happy Thanksgiving everyone.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:34]** Oh yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** Enjoy your turkey.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** Enjoy yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:42]** Carving a turkey is a singularly pleasurable experience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** Do you want that to be an Olympic sport?

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** Yes or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:48]** I would love for turkey carving to be an Olympic sport.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:51]** I would f***ing play at Olympic turkey carving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:53]** That would be the... That's cool.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** That's what happens when it goes wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** You don't want that to happen.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:01]** I don't want to knock you down, but I think you would lose.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:07]** How are we judging this on speed, efficiency?

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:09]** How is turkey carving being judged?

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** And then I'll tell you how you're wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** It's speed and cuts and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:14]** Right.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:29]** I think it's it's just like the gymnastics where you've got the technical portion of the score, which is like making sure you don't get any cartilage in the meat and you don't cut the bones you're not supposed to cut and that you get your finger off the bone.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:48]** um but then there's the artistic portion which like when how do your slices how do you present your your uniform slicing your skin content for each bite you know it's each of those really hard are you cooking the turkey too like are you gonna get judged on moistness or like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:48 - 00:15:12]** well this is not a cooking competition this is a car yeah yeah just carving so they're all there's like a general standard of like 10 pound turkey 12 pound turkey and we all and they're all cooked by the same provider in the same in the same manner same conditions yes yeah okay are you saying you and i need to do a turkey carving yeah i would totally smoke i'm so down for this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:12]** Let's do it.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:15]** Because one, I think I would beat you.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:20]** And two, I think it would be absolutely dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** We will eat the turkey afterwards.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** John and I will be taste testers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** For us to do a we'll save Thanksgiving dinner.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** Kevin will shoot us.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** He'll kill the turkey.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** There it is.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:32]** We'll save the Thanksgiving dinner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Prepare to get smoked, bud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** Welcome around the We'll Save Family table.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:41]** As we say every year, Happy Thanksgiving.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:43]** Thanks for being part of our wider family.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** I'm going to smoke a turkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:46]** I'm going to smoke you a carbon one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:50]** Talk your shit, Will.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:58]** Sometimes we clear off the game board, make way for some Thanksgiving plates.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** I carved bean turkey, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:05]** I used to work the carving station at Wolfgang Puck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** You have a few millennia on me.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** That is true.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** That's very true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:15]** Let's transition from our future sweet competition to playing some Starfinder.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** Our current competition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** Let's carve this turkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:22]** Let's carve this turkey.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** Thank you for that.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:27]** So, hopefully we find a wishbone.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** Wish.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:39]** You have landed on Veros at Tyrkala's base, the steward's outpost on the volcano moon.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** Death moon, as some call it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** Yeah, that's not ominous at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:48]** You have... Ironically, this is going to be the one place where we're not going to run into trouble, probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:51]** It's going to go perfectly smoothly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** Yeah, on death moon.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** It's all good.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** You are, and maybe turkey.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** Maybe there's some turkey there.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:11]** You meet the supervisor of the base, the Vrthani jocks herd, and their second in command, the unnamed Vlaka.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:15]** What is going on right now?

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** Kevin, just roll a 1D1013513.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** All right.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:21]** I'm going to need you to take all that energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** Just bring it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** Just bring it in.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:26]** He got $48 million.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:27]** He got $48 million.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** It's good.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** Thank you, Kevin.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** That's very good.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:34]** I appreciate that addition to this recap.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:36]** That's very thoughtful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:41]** The way that Kelly laughed about it.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** Good control, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** Good self-control.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** I'm sorry.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** I'm totally known for that.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** Yeah, no, you really are.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:53]** As you then went and started opening every door along the hallway in the guest quarters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:58]** I said, I love that here has never been anybody in the universe.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** Oh, my God.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** Shut up.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** All right.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** I know Kelly's learning.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:06]** Kelly's new to it, but here should know them all.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** Here should be very well versed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** And who did you meet?

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** Hyena people just dropped.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:14]** They just dropped is what you were saying, John, right?

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** They just dropped.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:18]** The Stuart Knoll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** The Stuart Knoll.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:28]** And Sylvania, the half-elf who gave Dr. Okay the highest compliment.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:32]** Otherwise, stone cold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:38]** I don't think John's ever regretted GMing as much as he does in this exact moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** You know what?

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:45]** It is part of the GM's path to just take things as they come.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:50]** And boy, have things come my way in this past episode.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:52]** Yes.

**[00:18:52 - 00:19:00]** It is after meeting them, after being thrown around by Orvier, we talked about how it's about 1500 people.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:06]** That as you all are starting to break off, you can hear some of the Pykes Peritons.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:09]** One of the doors to the rec room is open.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** You can hear some of them sitting, starting to chat.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** You all are breaking off individually.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:21]** Rec19 is looking up, I believe, some things about Akiton and also the Android Abolitionist front.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** we'll get to that in a minute.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:30]** Colin is, uh, Colin is going and looking up some things in Akitan and correct me if I'm wrong.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** Also on Absalom, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** Yeah.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:39]** You're just going like Absalom times.com.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:19]** That was a reach, man.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** That was a reach.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** That was a lot of creative liberty there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:26]** You were like a kid reaching for the cookies atop of the fridge there.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:32]** And Dr. O'Kane... I liked it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:33]** It was good.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:55]** Whichever one you think is more appropriate to figure out if Ray is like full of shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** Rel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** Rel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:59]** Probably medicine check.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** I'm going to bring you guys back over to the map here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:17]** I was going to do a bit of constantly getting her name wrong, but it's not working.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:19]** How does Rel do?

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Sorry.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:24]** I thought that you should do that again just in character.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** I mean...

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:31]** She seems to be very enthusiastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:34]** Is she genuine in her enthusiasm?

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:37]** She looks like a 1990s Saturday morning villain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** That is a sense motive check.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:44]** A medicine check is you getting the sense that she is experienced.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** She's a real doctor.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:21]** You get the sense that she's very excited in meeting you all in person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:23]** Is she being deceptive in any way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:28]** I mean, she seems like she's genuinely excited to meet you.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:30]** She doesn't seem like she's being deceptive.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:33]** You don't get the sense that she's hiding anything.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:39]** She's just trying to be friendly and say, you're going to have a debriefing tomorrow.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** But there's nothing deceptive.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:45]** She seems very excited for your debriefing.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** That's creepy.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** That's genuine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** It's probably because she's never met a Shirin.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:51]** That's it.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:52]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** No, stay away.

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:01]** Have you performed a lot of exams on Osharu's?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:04]** It's funny that you should ask that.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:10]** Because that, personally, for me, I haven't had...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:36]** i haven't seen many osharus uh not here not at any previous place of work so can i do a sense motive on that detect deception the 21 is the same she seems like she has not you know done a medicine check on that many osharus that many or or none like my question was any that many


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** Sorry, are you asking if I've examined a no-sharver before?

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:40]** Yes, I have.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:41]** Ew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** Anyway, I'm sure you all must be very tired.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:51]** I'm going to let you go, and I will see you tomorrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** Sleep well.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:53]** And turns.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Walks away.

**[00:24:55 - 00:25:04]** As she walks away, you see at the end of the hall, you see the back of Sylvania's head as the door opens.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:14]** Sylvania is walking through and out steps an android who then takes over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:24]** Oh, I'm going to just, I mean, we've got some time, I think, gents, before we sit down and eat, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:31]** Yeah, so dinner's at 1700 to 1900.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:34]** You can go there anytime into the galley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** Yeah, I know, right?

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:39]** I swear, if an old professor sits down and talks to us, I'm going to be like, what the?

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** Don't you dare drop that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** I'm Professor Rogan Benjamin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:45]** Oh my god, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** A loop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:48]** This is my null space saver.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** I just bought it.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** What is this room again?

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:51]** Up to the right?

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:53]** Sorry, which room are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:57]** The one that we walked past from the... Ah, okay.

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** So, you are walking into the galley.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:02]** Yeah.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:08]** So, as you walk through, I mean, it's several tables, a long bar.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:12]** You see a couple serving drones.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** starting to clean things up.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** There's some cooking equipment.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:19]** There's some low activity.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** Not a lot is going on.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:26]** It's 24 hours a day, so you get the sense that you could order something now.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** Hours, hours.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** So let's stick with Dr. O.K.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:30]** for a bit.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:30]** Dr.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** O.K.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** 's, you're walking around.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** You're just taking things in.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:49]** There are windows at the end of every corridor that look out onto a smoky, red, fiery landscape dotted by the neon technological light of the base as an identifier if you're seeing it from afar.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:50]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:53]** walks into the gym.

**[00:26:53 - 00:27:00]** Seems like there is a lot more here in this gym than in any other gyms that we might have.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:08]** There's a lot of machines that can adapt to different movements, different ranges of movement for building strength.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:33]** stamina you know you can run on things and simulate a lot of high intensity activity there are definitely weights there's also a in the northwest corner of the gym there's a mat where you can do like sparring tumbling things that you know stretching leaning out do i notice anything in this room out of the ordinary or any perhaps any like significant objects around

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** You don't notice anything in the gym that is out of the ordinary.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** Seems like it's a well-used space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** Hmm.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:44]** A lot going on in here, I suppose.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** There's no one in there currently.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:48]** It's just quiet.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:51]** You just hear the whew of the fan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:54]** I'm going to approach the android.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:55]** Okay.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:58]** And... Hello, I don't think I've met you yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:27:59 - 00:27:59]** Oh.

**[00:27:59 - 00:27:59]** Hello.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** Hello.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** How are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** I'm fine.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:06]** I'm just taking a look at your facilities here.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** They're quite impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** They are.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:11]** I mean, impressive is a word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** How would you describe them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:15]** Basic.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:19]** Let's just say a little basic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:23]** I mean, it's on a pile of magma.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** That's impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:29]** That is, you are absolutely right about that.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:32]** Sorry, and I didn't catch your name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:34]** I'm Dr. Kantu Okatis.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** Pleased to meet you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** It's good to meet you, Kantu.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** I am actually Lilac.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** Lilac.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** That's a beautiful name.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:53]** I don't know where that voice came from, but thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** I presume you're an android.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:57]** What is your function on this ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** Well, my function is actually as a...

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:08]** One of the, let's call them officers and the stewards to watch over this door here.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:15]** And, you know, I have other duties that I perform, but right now it's just to make sure that unfortunately she kind of slaps the back of the door.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:19]** You can't go back here unless you have somebody escorting you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** Oh, can we go back there then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** No, not right now.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:29]** No, it's in case there is a need for it.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:33]** My understanding is there is still a need for it, but I'll find out if there is one.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** Well, this is just where we sleep.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:42]** This is where the rest of the base is, all of our operations and command and everything else that we need to coordinate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:47]** Why is it so guarded here?

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:50]** Do you suspect that there's going to be trouble?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:53]** No, I think it's just... She kind of pauses.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:57]** She's like, I didn't think about that that way.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:00]** That's like the sense of the pause.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** I mean, you invited us here.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:06]** You could invite us elsewhere if there was going to be an issue, right?

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:06]** I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:09]** Oh, yeah, I'm sure that you're going to get invited elsewhere.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** That's not an issue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:16]** I just haven't got an invitation behind that door, and it sparks my curiosity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:19]** You ask a lot of really good questions.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** I really do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** That's how I became a doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** What are you a doctor of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:26]** Lots of things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** Medical doctor?

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** Like Dr. Nodens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** Yeah, like Dr. Nodens, sure.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** Okay, like Dr. Nodens.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:35]** It's a kind of... Nodens?

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** I research things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** This is the most amazing thing.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:48]** She sounds like she is not as interested in what you research, but she's like,

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** Okay, cool.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** You research things.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:53]** What does Dr. Nodens do?

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:59]** Well, Dr. Nodens is the doctor for the entire base, as well as anybody that might come through.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:01]** Obviously, like the Peritons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** So, yeah.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:04]** Interesting.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** I haven't talked to her too much.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** She didn't examine you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** No, she did.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:13]** But, you know, sometimes she gets excited and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:18]** I mean, do you have other doctors do you see regularly on this outpost here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:25]** No, there are, you know, some of my colleagues work with Dr. Nodens, so they're actually their assistants helping out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:28]** How do you get your primary care physician needs met?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** Dr. Nodens.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** But good question.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:34]** You are just full of this medical wisdom and knowledge.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** I mean, I'm just being small talk.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** You are not basic.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:41]** I'm sorry, what was that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** You know, small talk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:42 - 00:32:09]** small yes small talk she's she's like genuinely like yes small talk okay yeah that's good so people of different cultures greet one another oh yeah you know what it is good to meet somebody from another culture then she's like kind of like green as the day is long man like yeah but but very uh

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:23]** She come from... She's a wealthy Android family.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:24]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:28]** Is there anything else that I can help you with?

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:28]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:31]** I'm just... You're just walking around?

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** I'm just walking around.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:36]** I'm wondering, you know, see where the... There's only so many hallways to go down, you know?

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** Hot...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:40]** Well, that's part of the reason why I did call it a little basic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:46]** I would really like to have a full tour to see what all you guys got going on here.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:53]** It seems so spectacular being on a... I mean, I just want to see the view out of every room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** You know what?

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** There aren't too many views.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:59]** But I will pass it along.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** That you would like a full tour.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:08]** Maybe whenever you need to come back, I'll see if they can try and get you something.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** Sure thing.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** So that is the office.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:15]** As you walk up, there's a sign that says security office.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:18]** So that is where the Knoll was.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:22]** You can see through the glass that's on the right side, right?

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** It's like a walled door.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:50]** glass on the other side and you can see through that there is a there's somebody sitting uh behind two monitor screens at a desk at the far end of the room so this is where the the android is standing where the half elf was standing where the elf was standing yeah oh it's a full okay um so so sylvania sylvania is yes

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:27]** So when you walk in, you do see around the corner that there's a small humanoid sitting there.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:32]** You saw briefly a flash of purple hair and it looked like maybe a gnome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:35]** Man, that's some sick hair you got there, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:43]** I didn't mean to disrupt you while you were in your duties and all.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:48]** I just was wandering about, you know, as one does.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:14]** If you don't mind, I will talk to you later.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:15]** All right.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:42]** and he presses a button and the door shuts the politest conversation followed up by the sickly rudest conversation i feel like that person was rather kind of mean to doctor okay just subtly so yeah let's pause there for a second here's you were texting waiting to get back a response yeah maybe you were just chilling thinking you do get a response from shay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:46]** That says, haven't forgotten.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:49]** Like, re-armor, haven't forgotten.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:54]** Re-puck, still waiting on results.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:54]** Okay.

**[00:35:55 - 00:36:18]** hears replies uh with a heart like uh you know greater than three to both got it got it okay okay i don't know if emojis exist in starfinder so there you go yeah of course they do yeah it's like a little little purple heart emoji to represent okay okay um all right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:26]** Colin, you were just looking up what was going on in Absalom and Akiton, right?

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:27]** Yeah.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:33]** I think the big thing that you notice...

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:43]** is that there you find information that you already know about as you're just looking up.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:52]** You see some things that you're like, oh, I already know about what's going on with this particular event on Absalom.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** Maybe there's an election.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:57]** You're like, that already happened or I knew that was going to happen.

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:04]** There is a... There's a vote of a bill that didn't pass.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:06]** You're like... I already knew that.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** You start thinking about it.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:12]** You're like... I... A lot of this seems older.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:15]** There's not a lot new.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:21]** And by older, I mean on the new cycle of, like, maybe...

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:47]** week or two weeks like things aren't like before you know you like like before when we were talking earlier about like how many days has it been you know in in the whole thing so maybe like two or three weeks right so like he would have had more recent news on akaton before he was kidnapped sure sure but you do see a few things that are like oh that is new it

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:49]** You're like, the communication here is just limited.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:53]** It's like a more limited infosphere.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:53]** Got it.

**[00:37:53 - 00:38:01]** So they probably get updates at irregular times, let's call it.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:01]** Okay.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:07]** Not too much, though, about anything new.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:10]** There's no particular piece of news that grabs your attention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Okay.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:18]** I think... I mean, is that it for what Colin can do right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:18]** Or...

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** You can do it.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** You can go work out.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:21]** You can go talk to people.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** You can try and get some sleep.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:26]** You could go eat.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:28]** If you want to eat early, you could eat early.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:33]** Colin is going to head north into what I think is the rec room.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** Is this rec or is this massacre?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** That's the rec room.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** The yellow room with the yellow floor and the blues.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** Chairs and squares in the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:49]** And seeing a lot of Pyke's Puritans in this room with one open seating.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:54]** He walks in and says, do you mind if I have a seat?

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Spend some time with you all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:16]** sparkles is like oh god come on in and uh you see ezra and ale kind of make way for you it's it's it's fetch ale and ezra sitting around ezra seems to be reading ale and fetch uh are just sitting and chilling they were kind of


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:32]** talking a little bit as you're coming in but that's about it first I hope you all understand my colleagues and I did everything we could to keep you all from being hurt in defending ourselves oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:36]** Absolutely.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:39]** Don't even worry.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:46]** I think we have apologized a thousand and one times for the actions that we took.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:48]** Just so unbecoming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:57]** You can see the guilt on Ezra's Kasatan face as they are sitting there.

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:02]** They spoke up immediately from their book, like, saw you, wanted to reply to you on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:06]** There's no hard feelings here at all.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:08]** It wasn't you all.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:14]** We know there's a shared combatant.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:19]** So what do you all remember from that period?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:23]** Sorry, from what period?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:37]** From being awake on the Void Crier to, you know, I guess waking up after we got away from or blew up that gray ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:51]** Yeah, well, I mean, to be honest, I remember just an immense amount of pain and just this feeling that I was not myself anymore.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:58]** And it was like I was just, I was watching my own actions, but it was me.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:10]** Like I was, like I, I glimpsed at you all creepy and, you know, I shot at you and I, right, that, that, that didn't feel like me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:15]** Yeah, I just, I really didn't like the way that I acted.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:23]** I seem to recall that, and then you all, I fell unconscious, and then I woke up in the break.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:23]** Right.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** Tied up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** That's crazy.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:32]** Bit of a left turn, if you don't mind me asking.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:39]** There's been, when we arrived, that restricted section off to the east.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:43]** Is that something you all have access to?

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:47]** Or just those other folks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:50]** No, I mean, we...

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:55]** You know, we don't typically have access and we don't go there.

**[00:41:55 - 00:42:00]** This is, honestly, we're not here for long enough to want to go there.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:09]** We just do whatever the stewards ask us to do, although sometimes it's mostly just what can you go and what do you want us to do.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:12]** I think that was a bit of a lot.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** I am long-winded.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:13]** I forget.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** No, we don't have access.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** I thank you.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:23]** But was there something that you wanted to know about it, or did you just want to try it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:29]** I'm a curious person, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:40]** You know, they do have, so, okay, so there's the, this is, so we parked next to our ship, right?

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:43]** And then there is another ship.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:48]** let's call it garage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:53]** Like I, I, I have seen them in vehicles coming in and out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** So there there's somewhere else.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:59]** There's more vehicles or a garage or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:00]** Hi.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:05]** Would you be able to give me some direction to this other garage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:07]** I have not been to that other garage.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:11]** That's the other shoe that drops there.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** So, I'm sorry.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:15]** But I just... I recall seeing vehicles.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:18]** I have seen vehicles come out, you know.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:25]** I guess that precludes my next question about how strictly secure that space is.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:27]** Oh, I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:32]** You know, this is a very secure place.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:37]** They probably, I don't know, what do you guys think, maybe like 20?

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:40]** It's probably like 20, the stewards.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** And they are well-trained.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** They keep this place tight.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** They keep a lot of overrides.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:50]** Like, just watch them.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:52]** Like, they are very well-trained.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:56]** I will say, also, pretty, like, bright decorators.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** Like, look at this yellow floor.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** I mean, that's cool.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** I like it.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:06]** So, you know, like, I was expecting that out of, like, a Stuart Spice.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Yeah.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:09]** So, yeah.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:14]** The floor is a bit sparkly, and he winks it.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** Oh!

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:37]** i see what you did there yeah that was good that was that was good um and i think colin that's that's those are all the questions that i've got for them so i think at this point colin would just like shoot the okay hang out for a bit you start hanging out uh fetch talks a lot ale does not talk that much ezra


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:51]** We'll answer one question, but then that question will take, like, the answer will be five minutes long, which might or might not include Ezra's personal history and, like, lineage about his Kasathan family, which, yeah.

**[00:44:51 - 00:45:00]** Fun fact, he was a descendant of the original defenders of the Adari, the Voidrunners, part of the Voidcar name.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:04]** So anyway, let's sunset on that.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:06]** Not literally, although I am going to bump us ahead.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** Don't forget we have this time mechanic.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:13]** Just as things are going on, I'm going to move to Kev, and I'm just going to bump this ahead maybe until about 1600.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:19]** All of you are doing things in the hour to two hours.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:22]** Kev, you were Rick 19.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** Sorry, Rick 19.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** You were looking up two things.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:30]** You were looking up one, which is what's going on on Akiton, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:34]** Yeah, and I think Rick is drawn to Akiton.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:40]** He came from Akiton, but he still doesn't know a whole lot about Akiton, except for just in flashes.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:50]** And so he is searching information on Akiton, and I think similar to what Colin was doing, he's looking for current events.

**[00:45:50 - 00:46:02]** But I think what he's trying to do is piece together a timeline of how long has it been since he boarded the Chimera.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** That's one key thing he's looking for.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:08]** But then he's also trying to place a timeline of...

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** How long was it before that?

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:19]** He's trying to go back in his memory and find a point in Akatonian history that he actually remembers.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:26]** Because he's got gaps in his own memory about his life.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:35]** You also tried to talk... Tell me a bit more about your interface with the Android abolitionist front.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** What were you trying to do there?

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:44]** So the last thing he got was a message, and this is terrible for me as a player, but I can't remember exactly what it said.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:48]** It was just a person's name and a location, I believe.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** And I forget where I wrote that down.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** I did write it down somewhere.

**[00:46:54 - 00:47:02]** But that message kind of flashed across his comm unit and then disappeared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:29]** and so what what he's doing on the internet is he's accessing like a almost through vpn portal uh a place where those kind of messages are stored and and if he's going to get any more information from that i'll tell you two things one did everyone listen to what rick 19's message was at the end of book two is this i can't remember if anybody chose not to listen because i was just going to reread it i don't think i did okay okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:31]** I think I listened, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** Actually, I don't know.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:36]** Do you need to message it to you, Kev, or do you want me to say it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:40]** I'm okay with you guys listening, but meta-wise, you have no idea what this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** I'm going to mute my headphones.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** Just give me a hand signal when I can turn it back on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:48]** Three, two, one, mute.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:56]** The message was, new target acquired, Leovara-Roselight.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** Pretty sure that was the message.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:00]** And you know Roselight is on Leovar.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** Got it.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** Where can I write that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Is it paper somewhere?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** Yeah.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** Don't forget it.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:12]** You are...

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** I'll tell you one thing.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:19]** You know that this is a... Waving for Benny and Will to come back on.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:24]** You know that this is a steward's base.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:27]** You think that they probably track communications.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:35]** Do you want to access the Android abolitionist front from a... Or are you doing this on your comm unit?

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:37]** Or are you doing this on their network?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:44]** I would say Rick is not that well-versed in computers.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:54]** But I think he realizes, he thinks that there's enough encryption that the AAF is doing with the process that he's been given.

**[00:48:55 - 00:49:01]** So he's got a little RSA token and his comm unit pops up with 2FA.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** It seems like he's going through layers to get into this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:06]** He literally just gives somebody the 2FA code.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:36]** yeah so it's it's not it's not like he's he's not concerned about the man in the middle attack anyway okay rick rick 19 you piece together that it's been about 10 or 11 days since you got caught on board the camera as you start to remember back before that really their belief brief flashes of heat red

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:44]** And there is the feeling of being on the rooftop, as we saw in episode one.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** You try and think beyond that.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:54]** You had this vague recollection of the AAF.

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:00]** You don't quite remember what names and faces were, locations.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:03]** As you're doing that, maybe you're thinking about that as you're typing in.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:06]** You're like, you're going through the security code, and then you're like, how many days?

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** You're absentmindedly putting in passwords.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:14]** You know, you hear Colin laughing in the other room.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:19]** And then, error.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:27]** The AAF site that you go to on the server, on the computer in, what do you call it?

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** Your room?

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** Yeah.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** Doesn't exist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:37]** There's a noise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:39]** 1700.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** That's the dinner chime.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** I'm going to record that.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** Just me doing that.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** And I'm going to auto tune it.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** I'm going to make it into a whole thing.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:53]** It's like a really long time.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:55]** Yeah.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:58]** Thanks.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** Or got rushes over.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:07]** I mean, like it's a 24 hour galley, but Dr. K, you might see or got like, do, do,

## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:32]** Rick, he looks behind him because he's behind here.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:34]** You want to come along for some grub?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** Yeah, I'll join you.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** We need some time.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** Close us out the screen.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** I'm mind boggled.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:09]** I think Rick is in the same situation.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:18]** He's flabbergasted at not being able to reach the portal that he's been directed to a million times.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** It's been trained in him.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:46]** um and so he just yeah he kind of locks the computer and stands up follows you but like mindlessly it's always okay you seem a little you seem a little downtrodden gotta say i i'm not quite sure what's getting at me currently okay i'll be okay don't don't worry about me

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** I don't know why.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:50]** There's delicious drinks.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** There's great spread.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:58]** Do they have regional food available through the replicator?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** Any Vero specialties?

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:04]** Why, it's a... It's great that you ask.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:07]** They have this, like...

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:04]** Yeah, so you see Orgat and Kaniko start to get some food, fill up some grub, and they start sitting down, tucking in.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** Everybody seems to just be sitting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:11]** I'm a little surprised stewards aren't joining us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:14]** You just saying that out loud?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:15]** Okay.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** Is there not an extra seat for me?

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** I'm confused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:25]** It's not a lot of seating, to be fair, for a pretty big facility, I've got to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:30]** Yeah, it's not meant to have that many people coming through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** I'm going to sit next to Orgat.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:32]** Hey again, Orgat.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** Good to see you again.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:35]** I'm going to sit down here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** Is that cool with you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Yeah, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** Great, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** I'll sit down with Kanika.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:41]** Okay.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:46]** So you're sitting down with Kanika, and here's sitting down with Orgat.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:56]** There is like a place where you can sit on some stools, kind of pull a stool out, or stand like a chest-high shelf on the wall.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** And you guys just start eating.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:04]** Everybody seems to be just relaxed, in good spirits, talking.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:06]** Nothing going on in their head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:08]** Until...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:26]** until wait until john's voice changes when he starts to tell us about something all right so what happens next uh just walk in you're all part of an experiment so you are that's about it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** What do you guys want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:28]** So I said that out loud.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:36]** Did anyone kind of get a perception on when I, when I was like, I'm surprised the stewards haven't joined us.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:41]** Is there, did anyone like look funnily or besmirched?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:44]** No one seemed to like, no, no one seemed to look funny.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:50]** I mean, like I'm trying to picture what would happen if it like, I think you would want to ask somebody directly.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:52]** Cause I think just saying it out loud is like,

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** Oh, fair.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** Like, you're just saying that to, okay, like, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** I might ask, can you go in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** Yeah.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:01]** Oh, hey, yeah.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:05]** Sorry, you were, I thought I heard you say you're just asking at the stewards.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** Yeah, sometimes they come in.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:13]** I think they, you know, they probably have their own cafeteria that they're going to be eating at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:15]** Maybe they serve different food.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Maybe they serve different food.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** I mean, this is pretty good.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** I don't know if you had that lava stride drop, but I liked it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** I didn't care for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** Oh, okay.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** Well, you know, teach their own.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** That's fine.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:27]** That's okay.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** You know, we can't all have taste.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** It's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** She didn't say that.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:36]** What I really want is something that reminds me of home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** Something that reminds you of home, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** Let's see if we can go.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:57]** And Kaniko walks over and makes the effort to try and walk through some items and ask you what you had, what were ingredients, what were typical meals, seeing if she can scroll through and find either some preset item that's in there or make something for you.

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:00]** She's happy to kind of help you out on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** Very hospitable of her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:06]** What is everyone else doing?

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:08]** You just eating, chatting, having a good time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:11]** I think a light bulb just went off in my head.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:14]** Not necessarily in Colin's head, but I want to investigate this.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:20]** So did Colin notice where Orvier went?

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:21]** Okay.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:23]** Like where he took his food to eat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** Orville hasn't come in yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:29]** I think Colin is going to politely say, excuse me just a moment.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:35]** I think I've left the faucet running in our room.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** I need to go turn that off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:39]** I think I broke a dish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:49]** Colin heads over to Orville, who I think is... I think he goes off looking for Orville, who he doesn't see, actually.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:53]** You might recall that Orvir's room is on the bottom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:53]** Oh, cool.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** The one room I've not yet explored.

**[01:00:56 - 01:01:03]** So he heads over to Orvir's room and Knox politely says, Orvir, if you've got a moment, I've got a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** Oh, hi, Colin.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** How you doing?

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** Yeah.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:09]** What's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** Seems like he's sleeping.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:16]** Colin glances around and steps in and closes the door behind him and says, Orvir.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:23]** Um, they've mentioned that this is where, um, folks who were rescued are brought to.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:26]** Does anyone ever leave this planet?

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:30]** Does anyone leave this planet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]** I don't like where you're going with this, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** Who are you talking about?

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:38]** Well, my friends and I... We left this planet.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:39]** Presumably would like to get home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:42]** Oh, yeah, of course.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:42]** Be on our way.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:43]** Aye.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:43]** Aye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:47]** Yeah, I mean, we literally just landed.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:54]** So I... I mean, like... An hour or three hours ago...

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** So, yeah, that's the plan.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:59]** I think they want to talk to you, is my understanding.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:01]** Get a little bit more information.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:03]** So, put some things together.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:05]** You've been in great health.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:08]** And they just want to understand more.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:09]** Just to wake up a little bit.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:14]** Understand more about the experience you went through and how they can use it to help the packed world.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:23]** You know, all the standard steward stuff that they do to promote the peace and to help, you know,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:25]** So yes, people leave.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:30]** But from here, yeah, from those prison camps, I don't.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:33]** Those are criminals.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** Prisoners.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:38]** They're not trying to leave unless it's the end of their sentence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** Sure.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:45]** Do you know about how long we expect to be here before we can head home?

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:46]** Good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** I don't.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:51]** I'm thinking probably a couple of days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:54]** Oh, you're good enough.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** Thank you, Ovation.

**[01:02:56 - 01:03:03]** And I think Cullen is going to do, before he leaves the room, I want to roll a sense motive to see if Orvier is lying to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** Okay.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:08]** About, just like, in general, like, what is the vibe with Orvier right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:11]** Is he hiding something from me that...

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:18]** that like these questions would uncover or should have that, that these questions should have uncovered.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:21]** Uh, that's a 26, 26.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:23]** Okay.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:24]** Good.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:24]** Yeah.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:34]** Uh, I don't think he's hiding something from you, but he seems like he doesn't know a lot.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:38]** And he also is, how do I say this?

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:38]** Uh,

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:40]** It's not that he's not trying to be helpful.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:42]** He just is like, I don't know.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:47]** I'm barking up the wrong tree.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:54]** Yes, but also... Maybe you're barking up the wrong tree, but also...

**[01:03:55 - 01:04:00]** This tree doesn't seem like it is, like, the most, like, forthcoming.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:03]** Like, Orvir knows something else.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:05]** Like, just, like, in general.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:10]** Like, just, like, seems a little, like, surprised that you just, like, came and you're like, why didn't we leave it?

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:13]** Does anyone leave this planet?

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:15]** He's like, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:15]** All right.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:16]** Gotcha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:19]** Definitely not being forthcoming.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:26]** What exactly do they do on this planet that you know of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:29]** Like who?

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:31]** The stewards?

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:34]** So my understanding is the stewards hire us.

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:35]** They hire us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:37]** We show up and do their missions.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:49]** Also, if there are any problems with any of these camps, they are the first people to respond.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:57]** And typically they are a support for Prithida or Leovala, if there are any.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:04:57 - 01:05:13]** citizens or troubles but that that seems like it's a pretty low priority from my understanding most of this i think is uh protection of varus and making sure that varus stays secure and then uh you know missions right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:16]** Have there been... Oh, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:17]** I obviously just can't speak.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:21]** I can talk to you about the mission that I found you on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** I can't talk to you about the other missions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:34]** So you wouldn't know anything about the problems they've been having in the prison camps or anything like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:37]** I don't know, but I'm going to tell you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:39]** Anybody...

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:43]** He tries to leave these prison camps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:45]** Varos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:49]** Extremely inhospitable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:55]** Oh my god, we're gonna end up... You can't get anywhere without our... Make sure your environmental protections are good.

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:57]** Yeah, yeah, turn them on right now.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:00]** I'm sorry, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:22]** so honestly i you you can't get anywhere without even the freaking vehicle i don't want to go to prison i after all the stuff we've been through i prefer a journey somewhere else john like a different different kind of uh next step right yeah why do you think we're gonna go to a prison i don't know i just i just it just seems foreshadowing okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:27]** Reminds me of Star Trek 6.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:27]** Just a little bit.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:30]** No, Vinny's just thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:32]** He's just mentally frozen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:36]** Is there anything else going on?

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:40]** Or if you want to thank you for your assistance on Outpost Dominicon.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:41]** Yeah, of course.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:45]** For allowing me to barge into your resting time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:47]** That's all right.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:49]** Barge in any time.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:51]** I'll be as simple as I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:52]** Don't even worry about it.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:53]** Much appreciated.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:58]** Because I am an NPC, and that's what I do.

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:01]** Even when I'm sleeping, just come in and barge in on me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:07]** Well, if I'm sleeping in the middle of the night, I might not be the happiest, but I might be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:09]** Can I steal your armor for a minute?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:15]** No, wait until he falls asleep and then just take it off his body like a Bethesda game.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:15]** Absolutely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:18]** Absolutely not.

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:19]** Not at all.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:21]** All right.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:23]** So you... Peace out.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:26]** Close the door behind me.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:27]** Okay.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:31]** And can I just ask as a whole...

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:34]** I'm going to push the time ahead a little bit.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:37]** The light's going to get a little darker here as time's going on.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:39]** Let's just jump ahead.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:41]** It's about 1900 now.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:49]** What is everyone else doing as the night is starting to move into evening into night?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:55]** So Rick, he kind of eats dinner silently.

**[01:07:55 - 01:08:21]** like he he looks up a couple times like he wants to ask questions about his what he's thinking but like he he realizes like this isn't the right audience he's not gonna get the answers he wants so he kind of finishes his dinner pretty quickly and then just kind of excuses himself and goes back to that computer uh hold on i gotta exit all the doors one at a time i'm walking all the way back to my room down the hallway

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:25]** Uh, and so he goes and sits back down to that computer and he, he tries again.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:29]** He, he goes to the website he's told to go to.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:37]** He clicks on the things he's supposed to click on and he puts in his, his, uh, authorization codes and stuff.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:38]** And he hits enter.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:41]** Error.

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:48]** And then he's going to search for Leovara Roselight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:56]** You immediately get, like, you know, Pactopedia articles about Roselight.

**[01:08:57 - 01:09:03]** Population is, like, you know, it is a big city on Leovara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:09]** Here's this... See, I don't want a metagame, but I want to try to do something to help Kevin.

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:36]** with a computer's check i just want to check something i just don't think you would know i wouldn't know yeah i wouldn't invite you to this yeah i totally feel you but yeah yeah you're still sitting talking to or god who's telling you about the sparrow basilica whether you wanted to know or not wow very very interesting or god you just kind of look sadly at the name tag on her armor just like pretending very interesting oh you don't say yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:41]** And anybody else doing anything?

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:42]** Or Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:47]** Dr. AK is going to go out into the hangar.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:48]** Okay.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:54]** And he is going to look around the other ship.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:56]** Sort of just like...

**[01:09:57 - 01:10:01]** In a kind of restless way.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:04]** He's looking around into all the windows.

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:05]** Okay.

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:14]** And then I would say probably later on in the evening, if he's still feeling restless, he'll probably run in the gym or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:14]** I like it.

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:15]** Okay.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:15]** Yeah.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:16]** You're taking things in.

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:17]** You're walking around.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:22]** The last time you were in a hangar, you were leaving outpost Omicron.

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:25]** Now you're going in a gym.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:25 - 01:10:29]** Can I see anything outside of the hangar, like the lava field?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:39]** There is a window out, not onto the lava field, but you do see that there is a force field there, and you can see beyond as it starts to get to night.

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:40]** It's like night on a moon.

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:42]** There's an atmosphere, but it's not that thick.

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:51]** So really, the difference between day and night is just the fact that there is a source of light and there is not, and that source of light is starting to go down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:51 - 01:11:12]** uh to like dim down right and so you can see out there on foundry you can't but you can see out there that it's there okay colin um i think colin is pacing okay so i think he's he's worried that they because of what he's experienced over the last few days like

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:36]** are just stepping into another trap where the um stewards are going to try to imprison them on this planet for no reason at all yeah and so he is like pacing the halls plotting his escape um hoping he happens across one of his fellow teammates but i don't think he does

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:39]** So he's pacing around.

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:43]** He eventually heads back to his rack to lay awake for the night.

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:47]** He's just going to head back to the room.

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:52]** Yeah, he's just going to head back to his and Rick's room.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:54]** Okay.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:55]** What is Rick doing?

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:56]** Get ready to undo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:59]** Rick fires.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:03]** No, it's more like, you know, getting caught looking at porn type.

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:04]** Oh, sorry, sorry, man.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:05]** My bad, my bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:12:07 - 01:12:10]** I'm just going to, like, I'm going to close my eyes and everything.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:12]** He, like, lays backwards on the bunk.

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:15]** I'm just going to take a moment, all right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:20]** All 800 eyes close, and then, like, 400 of them slide up.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:21]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:25]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:27]** I love that.

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:28]** Okay.

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:30]** I'm going to start to move the clock forward a little bit in time.

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:31]** It's going to get a little darker.

**[01:12:32 - 01:12:34]** You know, the doors start to shut.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:34]** Oh, my God.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:37]** People are going, doing things.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:40]** I'm just closing doors, just doing a little hygiene on Foundry.

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:41]** Enjoy this moment, everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:43]** Enjoy your last moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:43]** And, Dr.

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:48]** O.K., what time do you, it's about 2100, you were walking around, you were maybe doing some activity.

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:49]** What time do you come to bed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:55]** I think I'm going to wait until Lilac gets off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:57]** Okay.

**[01:12:57 - 01:12:58]** It is around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:58 - 01:12:59]** I just want to see who's coming in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:00]** Sure.

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:18]** So at 2300, you see that there is a, there's a, the door opens and there is a, that's who it was.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:21]** There's a human male bearded.

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:27]** With short hair, kind of a stern face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:33]** Is Baxter still at the desk inside the security room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:35]** Yeah, Baxter still is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:37]** So he's on a long shift.

**[01:13:37 - 01:13:41]** He's on like a longer shift than Lilac?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:42]** You're getting ahead of me.

**[01:13:43 - 01:13:44]** I see where you're going, but you're getting ahead of me.

**[01:13:44 - 01:13:48]** Because behind the human male is a Kasathan.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:54]** And Baxter comes out and sees you.

**[01:13:54 - 01:13:55]** Oh, hi.

**[01:13:57 - 01:13:57]** How are you?

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:01]** You know, they kind of, like, it's like the changing of the guard.

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:05]** Lilac and Baxter start to leave.

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:10]** And the human male and the male Kasathan step out.

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:15]** The Kasathan comes and heads into the security office.

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:22]** And then the human male steps up in front of the door and locks the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:27]** Well, hey, I just want... It's so late, but it's nice to meet you.

**[01:14:29 - 01:14:30]** Sorry, what's your name?

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:32]** Young... Young Sir?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:36]** That's the most suspicious conversation ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:41]** You're just standing there the whole time watching them as they change the guard.

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:43]** I was hitting the gym super hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:49]** I was trying to talk to Lilac and Baxter before they head out, and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:49 - 01:14:54]** Uh, I mean, they like gave you a polite nod and like, Hey, yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna head off and go to sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:57]** Uh, yeah.

**[01:14:57 - 01:14:58]** How are you doing?

**[01:14:59 - 01:15:04]** My name is, uh, my name is brick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:09]** Well, Brick, that's a great name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:09]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:10]** Solid name.

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:11]** I told my parents the same thing.

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:12]** I love masonry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:16]** I'm a big masonry guy myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:17]** Yeah.

**[01:15:17 - 01:15:20]** The old architecture, it's wild.

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:22]** They don't make them like they used to.

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:23]** You know what I mean?

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:23]** They don't.

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:24]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:24]** They really don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:25 - 01:15:26]** No.

**[01:15:27 - 01:15:31]** Say, so how long have you been in this joint?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:33]** Quite a while, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:35]** Seen a lot of people come and go, I take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:15:35 - 01:15:37]** Seen a lot of people come and go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:37 - 01:15:38]** Yeah.

**[01:15:38 - 01:15:41]** Certainly, yeah.

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:42]** Where do they go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:15:42 - 01:15:47]** I don't know.

**[01:15:48 - 01:15:51]** You're asking some pretty, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:52 - 01:15:56]** Well, it's a strange place to me that I, you know.

**[01:15:56 - 01:16:02]** I guess this is a base that it's got its own methods to its madness, so to speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:02]** Yeah.

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:06]** I mean, it can be unfamiliar.

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:07]** I get it.

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:08]** Right?

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:14]** You know, it's like when they're building a new building.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:18]** And you see it going up, and you're like, there did not used to be a building there.

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:20]** This is strange.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:23]** But after a while, you get used to it.

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:29]** I think that maybe you're just in that phase of being like, I'm just getting used to this right now.

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:33]** It's going to be a little strange.

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:35]** I don't know how long you're here for.

**[01:16:35 - 01:16:36]** They don't tell us that kind of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:38]** Who's they?

**[01:16:39 - 01:16:40]** Just the higher-ups?

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:41]** Yeah.

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:42]** The non-working man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:16:43 - 01:16:43]** Yeah.

**[01:16:43 - 01:16:44]** You know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:44]** Yeah.

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:46]** You know.

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:47]** I did my stint.

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:49]** Don't... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:16:50 - 01:16:51]** What?

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:51]** Dr. O.K.

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:52]** was in the military?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:54]** No, not in the military.

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:56]** You were a steward?

**[01:16:56 - 01:16:57]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[01:16:57 - 01:16:58]** Nothing like that.

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:04]** I just mean duty to a higher cause.

**[01:17:04 - 01:17:09]** I've served in a way back in my home world.

**[01:17:09 - 01:17:11]** I'm in a shower, by the way.

**[01:17:11 - 01:17:12]** I don't know if you can tell.

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:13]** Yep, I know.

**[01:17:13 - 01:17:15]** Very big into academia.

**[01:17:15 - 01:17:23]** But you always got to start somewhere doing light duty, you know, working in a lab or whatever.

**[01:17:23 - 01:17:24]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:26]** And you said, you know what?

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:28]** I'm going to become a smarty pants.

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:29]** And that's what you did.

**[01:17:29 - 01:17:32]** And that's got to give you a lot of respect for that.

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:34]** Sorry, I didn't catch your name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:34 - 01:17:37]** Dr. Kantu Okada.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:17:37 - 01:17:38]** Of course you're a doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:38 - 01:17:41]** Yeah, but I mean, really, almost everyone on my planet's a doctor.

**[01:17:42 - 01:17:43]** So it's, you know, less impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:46]** Well, I mean, it's impressive to me, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:46 - 01:17:49]** So, yeah, yeah.

**[01:17:49 - 01:17:50]** Well, anyway.

**[01:17:51 - 01:17:51]** All right.

**[01:17:52 - 01:17:54]** Hey, just between you and I. Yeah.

**[01:17:54 - 01:17:58]** You ever hear anything about greys?

**[01:17:58 - 01:18:00]** Their eyes, like, go up for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:02 - 01:18:06]** There's a brief flash of like, the fuck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:18:08 - 01:18:18]** And then he's like, other than, you know, I guess conspiracies.

**[01:18:18 - 01:18:24]** I mean, look, there are some things that I believe, don't get me wrong, but that, not one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:28]** What kind of conspiracy are we talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:18:29 - 01:18:30]** It's too late to go into that now.

**[01:18:30 - 01:18:32]** It's the perfect time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:34]** How many folds in this conspiracy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:18:35 - 01:18:37]** There is definitely a lot.

**[01:18:38 - 01:18:40]** There is a lot out there that we do not know.

**[01:18:41 - 01:18:41]** Am I right?

**[01:18:41 - 01:18:43]** There is a lot out there that we do not know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:51]** I'm dedicated to the search of uncovering knowledge hidden away.

**[01:18:51 - 01:18:55]** That's what we who research do.

**[01:18:55 - 01:18:56]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:58 - 01:18:58]** We'll talk about it.

**[01:18:59 - 01:19:01]** Well, I'm sure we'll get there.

**[01:19:01 - 01:19:04]** I do have some checks to do and some things to take care of.

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:05]** Right on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:07]** What time are you clocking out, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:19:08 - 01:19:09]** I am here throughout the night.

**[01:19:10 - 01:19:13]** Sometimes you just get the short stick.

**[01:19:13 - 01:19:14]** You know what I'm saying?

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:44 - 01:19:44]** Yeah.

**[01:19:44 - 01:19:45]** You ask me when I get off?

**[01:19:45 - 01:19:47]** Yeah.

**[01:19:47 - 01:19:51]** Yeah, I mean, that's fine.

**[01:19:51 - 01:19:54]** If you want to hang out, I'm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:19:54 - 01:19:58]** I mean, if you want to get some breakfast, I can see about getting some breakfast.

**[01:19:58 - 01:19:59]** Yeah.

**[01:19:59 - 01:20:00]** Is there anything good around here?

**[01:20:00 - 01:20:03]** Whatever you want is in the galley and in the cafeteria.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:03 - 01:20:04]** I keep hearing that.

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:06]** That's all right.

**[01:20:07 - 01:20:08]** Maybe I'll see you in the morning.

**[01:20:09 - 01:20:10]** Thanks a lot, man.

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:10]** I'll be here, man.

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:11]** It's good to meet you.

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:22]** Tell your friend in the security, I know he's probably watching us right now, but he waves, I guess, to the camera in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:25]** Yeah, there is no camera in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:27 - 01:20:28]** So what are they watching on?

**[01:20:29 - 01:20:31]** What are they watching on the security cameras?

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:33]** The security desk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:34 - 01:20:35]** Why are you asking me that question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:35 - 01:20:37]** Why are you asking me that question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:37 - 01:20:41]** Well, I mean, if there's no cameras here, then what are they doing back there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:46]** Dr. O'Keefe is waving at the ceiling for no reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:20:46 - 01:20:48]** You're asking a lot of questions that I do not have answers for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:49 - 01:20:50]** That's all right.

**[01:20:50 - 01:20:52]** I appreciate your time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:20:52 - 01:20:54]** I appreciate your curiosity, Doctor.

**[01:20:55 - 01:20:57]** If only I could be an ounce as curious as you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:20:57 - 01:21:04]** I need Doctor OK to just come into my life and just ask extremely random things and shit.

**[01:21:04 - 01:21:07]** Just start asking questions.

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:08]** I know where Will's going with this.

**[01:21:08 - 01:21:10]** At the same time, it's funny.

**[01:21:11 - 01:21:12]** Yeah.

**[01:21:12 - 01:21:14]** Just showing up being like, hey, so Grace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:15 - 01:21:18]** Whoa, what's up, Grace?

**[01:21:18 - 01:21:19]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:20 - 01:21:23]** Yeah, so Dr. O'Keefe's going to slide into the bottom bunk.

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:29]** And then Colin... I don't know about this place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:34]** Colin, what time do you get off?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:34 - 01:21:35]** Is Colin, like, asleep?

**[01:21:35 - 01:21:36]** Like, dead asleep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:21:37 - 01:21:44]** Call it, like... Squish, squish, squish.

**[01:21:45 - 01:21:47]** At this point, I don't think Colin would mind.

**[01:21:47 - 01:21:49]** Um...

**[01:21:49 - 01:22:16]** so I think the as soon as he hears the door open Colin visibly flinches like startles awake that's me no need to sorry I didn't mean to startle you there it's because it's you doctor I've got a bad feeling about this place yeah it's not filling me with warm and fuzzy either


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:16 - 01:22:20]** I got something that'll help us relax, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:22:23 - 01:22:25]** Yeah, true that.

**[01:22:25 - 01:22:30]** I love the mental picture of Colin and Dr. O.K.

**[01:22:30 - 01:22:31]** just toking it up.

**[01:22:35 - 01:22:38]** It's just like super paranoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:22:38 - 01:22:40]** Whatever helps you get to sleep.

**[01:22:40 - 01:22:40]** I like that.

**[01:22:41 - 01:22:42]** That needs to be a thing.


## Speaker_0

**[01:22:42 - 01:22:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:42 - 01:22:44]** That needs to be a thing.

**[01:22:44 - 01:22:47]** Definitely needs to be a thing.

**[01:22:47 - 01:22:49]** He's like, so what about Grace, bro?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:22:49 - 01:22:51]** What about them, bro?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:22:52 - 01:22:54]** Hey, man, so there's this guy, Brick.

**[01:22:54 - 01:22:56]** He knows some conspiracies.

**[01:22:56 - 01:22:58]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:22:58 - 01:23:02]** He says he's not quite into the gray one, but he knows some other ones.

**[01:23:02 - 01:23:04]** We should totally chill with him sometime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:23:04 - 01:23:06]** He says there are things we don't know.

**[01:23:06 - 01:23:10]** We should invite him to hang out with us and chill, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:23:10 - 01:23:13]** They're guarding this place pretty tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:23:15 - 01:23:31]** tougher for my liking to not be hiding something there's got to be something they're hiding here my concern right now is that what they're hiding is going to keep us here longer than we want to stay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:23:31 - 01:23:32]** Yeah, I don't like that one bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:23:32 - 01:23:33]** I don't either.

**[01:23:33 - 01:23:37]** I think tomorrow we need to figure out what the hell is going on here.

**[01:23:37 - 01:23:38]** What to do.

**[01:23:39 - 01:23:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:23:40 - 01:23:43]** Yeah, there's no smoking gun for this, but I'm sort of worried, too.

**[01:23:43 - 01:23:45]** There's no smoking gun yet.

**[01:23:46 - 01:23:46]** Yeah, true.

**[01:23:46 - 01:23:47]** I'm just, yeah.

**[01:23:48 - 01:23:50]** I just don't trust this AP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:23:50 - 01:23:52]** I don't trust this medical exam.

**[01:23:53 - 01:23:55]** They're going to put us in quarantine or some garbage.

**[01:23:56 - 01:23:56]** Yeah.

**[01:23:56 - 01:23:59]** They didn't say anything about putting you in quarantine.

**[01:23:59 - 01:24:01]** Yeah, but they never lead with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:24:02 - 01:24:05]** No.

**[01:24:05 - 01:24:06]** Man, you are.

**[01:24:06 - 01:24:11]** Dr. OK is really hitting some good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:24:11 - 01:24:21]** And while you guys are all freaking out about like the current situation, what John dropped on me today, I'm just racking it to my brain about like, oh, my God.

**[01:24:22 - 01:24:22]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:24:23 - 01:24:24]** So it's about.

**[01:24:25 - 01:24:25]** I don't know.

**[01:24:27 - 01:24:27]** 7 a.m.?

**[01:24:28 - 01:24:28]** Shift change.

**[01:24:31 - 01:24:31]** Of course.

**[01:24:31 - 01:24:34]** Is everyone asleep?

**[01:24:34 - 01:24:35]** Are they awake?

**[01:24:36 - 01:24:38]** Sleeping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:24:39 - 01:24:40]** I'm a light sleeper.

**[01:24:40 - 01:24:47]** I was going to say, Colin's at this point on that ragged edge of barely asleep, almost awake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:47 - 01:24:49]** Always sleeping with one eye open.

**[01:24:50 - 01:24:51]** Yeah.

**[01:24:51 - 01:24:51]** Okay.

**[01:24:52 - 01:24:52]** Brick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:24:54 - 01:24:57]** Yeah, I think he's pretty sound asleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:57 - 01:24:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:25:01 - 01:25:07]** There's a knot on Dr. O'Kane calling you in the red store at 7 a.m.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:25:07 - 01:25:11]** Dr. O'Kane, is that you again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:25:11 - 01:25:11]** That's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:25:11 - 01:25:11]** Oh!

**[01:25:11 - 01:25:11]** Yeah, dude.

**[01:25:12 - 01:25:13]** Of course.

**[01:25:14 - 01:25:17]** Well, who could it be?

**[01:25:17 - 01:25:18]** Who could it be?

**[01:25:18 - 01:25:19]** Wonder who's dying at the door.

**[01:25:20 - 01:25:20]** Find out next week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:25:20 - 01:25:21]** It's Brick.

**[01:25:21 - 01:25:23]** He's like, yo, let's go get some food.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:25:24 - 01:25:26]** Hey, man, you starving?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:25:26 - 01:25:28]** Do they have breakfast burritos?

**[01:25:28 - 01:25:32]** I just smoked a fat blunt with Eden Brick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:25:32 - 01:25:35]** I was about to say, I don't believe in aliens, but I got plenty of ghost stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:25:36 - 01:25:38]** I bet they've got some serious munchies right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:25:42 - 01:25:43]** Amazing.
