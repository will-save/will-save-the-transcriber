**[00:00:15 - 00:00:27]** With instructions to meet in the cargo bay, our crew instead decided to misdirect and play coy with their steward cohorts after feigning a flight to safety through the previously discovered shaft between the reactors.

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:38]** But their trickery seemed of little consequence as the stewards appeared to be genuinely glad our gang made it out alive and our heroes were greeted aboard the Voidcrier by Gnarla Shay and his team.

**[00:00:38 - 00:00:47]** who quickly made it off the cursed rock outpost Omicron, the converted asteroid turned laboratory hidden away in the Fogrim system.

**[00:00:48 - 00:00:59]** Now free from the clutches of their grey captors, our crew receives some clandestine communiques as their host Shay directs them to view the cascade of explosives erupting from the outpost.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:17]** But whatever celebration there may have been at the site of the fiendish funhouse's fiery demise, as total destruction seems more imminent, time begins to grind and slow to a halt, then reversing around the asteroid, finally blinking out of existence in an instant, without a trace as we end Book Two.

**[00:01:18 - 00:01:24]** But with this book now concluded, will Kev's questions and queries to what took place be acknowledged?

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:34]** Or will GM John continue to disclose nothing more than quandaries of confusion and further confound our cohort in his world of illusion?

## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** Like no offense, but it was kind of process of elimination at that point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** I'm just saying.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:44]** All right.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:44]** That's true.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** For the record.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** That's true.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** We never got together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** We never clicked.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** Look, we can go into this.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** I want to think about Dice Cam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** We can go into this on the Discord.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:05]** Dice Cam and Kelly can each share their part of the story in the random channel.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:06]** So it'll be good.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:08]** It's fine.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:13]** Till then, let's talk about We'll Save the Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** We'll save!

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:16]** We'll save!

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:25]** I think we should play a dating game, but I think Will should be the host, and I think Vinny should be the contestant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** I love it.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:26]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:29]** What's the name of the person that's dating everybody else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** All right.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** The Bachelor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** The Bachelor, Bachelorette, your choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:36]** So for me and for our listening audience, how does this work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:44]** So, Will will be the host, and then the Bachelorette will be the Bachelorette, and then there will be three contestants.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:53]** And the whole thing is that each contestant, Will was going to be texting us what our characters actually are.

**[00:08:53 - 00:09:02]** And we act those out and it's up to the bachelor or bachelorette to determine who we are and answer by the time we are done with the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:03]** All right.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:19]** So I'm going to be... Okay, coming up with things for your characters that I am going to privately... For the listeners at home, I am furiously typing away at...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:38]** giving a a tidbit of information for our contestants to then improv from uh here we go also while he's thinking i will jump in and say i think that uh just just want to extol the virtue of some improv games in your group because

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:43]** because I think it really helps bring about a sense of working together as a group.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:44]** Yes.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:49]** Anding all buying into the same scenario, the same scene being creative.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:52]** I think it's really fun to do before your games.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:57]** It's a great way to, to just kind of loosen up your creativity, have fun, work on those skills.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:05]** You can talk about like how to react to each other and build, you know, the, the creativity in the world that you're all buying in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** Obviously I'm not an expert in,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:10]** but I think you should do it if you're at home listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:19]** I don't want to get too serious with this, but in reality, um, an improv class, I highly recommend an improv class just for anybody and everybody, because it'll help you.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** It'll help you with public speaking.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:23]** It helps you with confidence, socializing, confidence.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:30]** There's, there's all sorts of games that you play, but like in reality, those games are what we do on a daily basis with everybody.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:36]** Whenever you're talking to a stranger, whenever you're talking to even your friends and your, your partners and your spouse, um,

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:40]** Those social skills you're using, that's all improv actually is.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** We like to also apply voices and make it fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:48]** The role that you come up with in the games, you also play roles in your life.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:53]** Those improv skills apply to any role that you may play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:53 - 00:11:03]** One of the hardest games I ever played, and I forget exact rules on it, but it was all about you either are lifting the person or lowering them in that conversation.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** Like you're either talking up or talking down to somebody.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:11]** And the goal is to actually be the higher person by the end of the game.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:13]** So you're constantly like giving or taking, giving or taking.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** And then it's like, okay, stop.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** And like whoever had that upper hand at the end of the game.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:21]** But like it gets very serious.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:25]** And some of those sentences can come in real heavy.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:28]** And you're like, ouch, that hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:30]** We should play that game in a safe context.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** I'll look up the rules on it.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** I've got an improv book somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** Will, are we ready?

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:37]** We are, I believe, ready.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** Vilamina...

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:07]** Philomena, introduce yourself to our contestants, to the eligible bachelors.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** Pretend you're in the ocean.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** Okay.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:45]** Maybe you're like, oh, no, there's salt water in my eye.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** And you're rubbing your eye.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** And then you open your eye.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:51]** And what's right there in front of you?

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:55]** Just a bunch of sea monkeys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:58]** Like, how fun would that be?

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** Right?

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:03]** I mean, it would just be rad to just be like... Sea monkeys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** You know, just think about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** In my eye?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:07]** No.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:10]** Well, you know, it could be in your eye.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:14]** The closer to your eye, the more that you can see their beauty.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:17]** I mean, look, they're hand-made.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:17]** All right.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:20]** And they're really attractive.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** They're really great.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:26]** You're going to see them and be like, wow, the multitude of colors, the ocean salt spray.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** Let's do that on our first day.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** We got some great packages.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** Just let me know when it comes around to ask some questions.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** I got all the answers.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** Shipping handling is on me.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:39]** It's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:47]** And our final bachelor, uh, Nelly, Nelly, tell us, uh, about, you know, what, what really turns you on?

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:50]** And, uh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:53]** You know what I really think that you should do?

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:57]** I think you should come hang out with me and my beautiful bird.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** Oh, he's so beautiful.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** His name is Winston.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** He's great.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:05]** And he can do everything, everything.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:10]** And I feel like if you like getting your face sat on by a bird, this is the bird that you want.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** All right.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:14]** Honestly, he and I, I'm going to be honest.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:18]** If it were up to me, I would be, you know, I wouldn't be here.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:22]** There's someone whose affections haven't been returned to me yet.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:28]** But I feel like we could make something work as long as the bird's involved, right?

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** You got to like Winston.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:31]** Keep your cats away from him, by the way.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** No cats on the dates allowed.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:39]** So if you want to come and ride on the wings of Fury, come with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:40]** Let's do it.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** That sounds like fun.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** Bachelor number one.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:48]** If we were to have a weekend together, where would we go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:56]** Well, I really... I kind of stay... Me and my people, we kind of stay inside most of the time.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:59]** I don't think I've seen the sun in the last 14 years.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:03]** That's because the apocalypse is going to happen, so we were just prepping for it.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:13]** I know it hasn't happened yet because we still have satellites, and those things probably... Our satellite TV would probably not be working if something didn't happen, but it could happen any minute, so we're...

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:19]** We might have to actually open the hatch because there's definitely a problem with our issues here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:25]** Bachelor number one, you sound pretty prepared for whatever might happen.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** Any catastrophes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:30]** We were prepared for everything but the backup.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:36]** Yeah, Woo's right.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:39]** Oh, goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:44]** Your bunker sounds like it's full of unmentionables.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:50]** There are things down here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** I hope you brought your waiters.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** Bachelor number two.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:57]** Yeah.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** If I was to cook dinner for us...

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** What would you like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:02]** That's a really good question here.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** Think about this.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:06]** You seem like you're really good at selling.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** Right.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:10]** Like you like you can really just nail it.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:16]** Like you have this aptitude for bringing yourself and getting, you know, just just getting people on board.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:22]** So what I want to ask you is sell me the dinner that we would have.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:26]** Sell it to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:31]** I would be serving fried sea monkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:33]** It's great.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:38]** With a side of oyster salad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** You know, that sounds great.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** You nailed it.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:45]** I feel like I'm already eating oyster salad right now as I'm talking to you.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** It's already in my mouth.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** It's all in my mustache.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:51]** And I'm just loving it.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:51]** Oyster salad.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:55]** Just oyster salad all in this.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:59]** And that's credit to you because you really sold me on it.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:01]** So let me just go over this.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:05]** I'm going to take a piece of paper right here, right?

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** And I'm going to take a pen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:10]** Bachelor number two, are you trying to sell me a timeshare?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** No.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:15]** Timeshares are for chumps.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:20]** Okay, so there's really a lot more here that I think that you're missing.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:25]** Why don't you talk to bachelor number three, come back, and then I will show you exactly what I'm talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** That was mighty uncomfortable.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:49]** bachelor number three yeah if we were to go on vacation oh sorry winston sit down come here winston sit on my finger yeah go ahead if you and i were to go on a vacation alone what's the first thing we would do

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:55]** Well, I was thinking a tree house would be really nice, you know, like a nice home built up in a tree.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:58]** But I got to say, it really can't be alone.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** Winston's got to come.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:05]** But Winston's feathers, if you just spread his feathers like this, you kind of like fan them out.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** F*** me.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:15]** Like you just like hold them up to the sun and it's the most radiant f***ing shine you've ever seen emanating off of his body.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:20]** And if you come to the top of that tree with me where the light's really good, you'll see it, and it will be life-changing for you.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:22]** And then maybe he can sit on your face after.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:23]** Something like that.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** All right.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:24]** I highly recommend it.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** Thank you, bachelors.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:33]** Bachelorette, which of our eligible bachelors would you like to go on a date with and why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:37]** Before you do that, can I just share with you real quick what's going on here?

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:37]** Sure, certainly.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:39]** Contestant number two.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** So check this out.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:43]** Okay, so see, this...

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:45]** is you, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:58]** Then... For those of us listening, our contestant number two has drawn a diagram of a... This is you selling sea monkeys, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** It's a pyramid scheme for sea monkeys.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:03]** Then, the thing is that...

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:10]** It's really all about the more that you sell, then there's me, right?

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:17]** And this era indicates the positive flow of the cash going up, right?

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:26]** So the more that you make, then the thing is that you become my spot and then I become your spot.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:35]** Again, consider the ocean scenario, the waves, the salt spray, the sea monkeys.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:37]** I think everyone would buy into this.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:39]** This is perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** I think I could actually, I'm in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:42]** See, I'm in.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:45]** Whatever you need from me, I'll do it.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:45]** Yep.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:52]** I'm actually going to take credit for that sale, Bachelorette, but I can teach you how to get your next one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** That's fine.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:53]** That's fine.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:56]** Sounds like an intriguing opportunity, Bachelorette.

**[00:20:56 - 00:21:01]** Tell us, which one of our bachelors would you like to spend more time with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:08]** Well, my cats really love birds, though maybe not in the same way as bachelor number three.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:16]** However, I think bachelors one and two seem more interested in each other.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** So bachelor number three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:25]** Congratulations, bachelor number three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:44]** what's this gonna sit on your face what do you think we all do oh my goodness yes y'all i'm dead kevin kevin is a prepper who has a uh septic backup in his bunker


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** Yes, yes, sir.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:50]** He's actually a normal person.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:54]** A normal person, but you live underground in a cave and have a plumbing issue.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** You smell like a septic tank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:57]** Oh, no.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:05]** John, he's a multi-level marketer selling sea monkeys.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** That's exactly what we'll say.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** That diagram.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** The diagram sold it.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** It was so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** That was really good.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:20]** And Kelly has a erotic relationship with his bird.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:22]** Accurate.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:26]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:29]** That's actually nothing to do with, it's nothing to do with Will's symptom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:35]** It's just Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** We're just Kelly.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:39]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:44]** For the record, I said you are an avid falconer who is secretly in love with your falcon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:50]** I didn't want to open up the relationship the Falcon did, but you're welcome to come in.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** I want to keep him happy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** That's why you broke up with Dice Camp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:00]** And that is our... Yeah, that's why you're not with Dice Camp.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:02]** The Falcon just shook his head like, no.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** Amazing.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** Ah, improv.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** It's the stuff of life.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:13]** Let's jump into the reason that we're here.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:19]** Plot Armor, part deux, part dos, part two for book two.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** What a wild time.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:29]** Again, we're going to get into an overview walking through the whole book from episode 29 to episode 69.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** There will be spoilers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:33]** So that's something to keep in mind.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** There will be spoilers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** There will be spoilers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Thank you for listening to our show.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:42]** But if you're going to listen to our show from the beginning, you probably should start there, not here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** Yeah.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** You know what I'm going to do?

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:53]** I'm going to, using my improv skills, I'm going to throw the keys over to whoever wants to start talking about what happened right in episode 29.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:55]** Oh, Kelly, you got a question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:07]** Oh, I wanted to say, if it's not clear, like this, if you do, we do recommend that you start from the beginning, but if you do want to start from book three, this is one way of encapsulating what we've done.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:12]** So if you are starting late, this is your, you know, quick summary of what's happened, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:16]** And I think we should start actually with a brief rundown of book one.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:17]** Just a super quick rundown.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:27]** Four of us met on a docking bay to board the Chimera, which was a ship from Liberty Station to Absalon Station.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:31]** And once we were on board, weird things started to happen.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:37]** There was some weird stuff with what goblins found things that we found.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:42]** Goblins are looking for another starship that was embedded into the Chimera.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:44]** I'm trying to think of all the stuff that happened.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** That was just crazy.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:50]** There was a relic on supposedly a relic that wasn't actually a relic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:50]** Yeah.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** So here's the thing.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:54]** Somebody, as soon as they take off.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:59]** Then there is a case, a missing persons case on board.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:07]** And naturally, our four adventurers were kind enough to investigate.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:15]** And as a result, all these other mysteries and strange occurrences and events, eerie things start to happen.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** Including shapeshifters.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** Shapeshifters.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** There's a hostile takeover.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:44]** of the ship by pirates by pirates also by remember jinchiroga who is the super intense beast who can eat your soul it's pretty cool i wish that would have happened and then at the end what happens at the end well there's the biggest thing was one of the bigger things was that the shape defenders actually took over the captain


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:48]** And at one point, we found the captain's body, but we had just interacted with the captain.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:51]** So we know that the captain's actually a shapeshifter.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:55]** And then people just started dropping dead in the middle of this hostile takeover.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:58]** So we ran for the escape pods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** There are explosions.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:05]** The ship is like, warning, you must evacuate immediately before the ship blows up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** Yep.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:11]** And that's where we, as our escape pods are leaving the ship,

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:38]** kind of where we take off here that was the end of book two was the pods are leaving the ship and we realize the ship's kind of like suspended in this room almost like a studio where the ship's like held up on like hydraulics essentially and it was all some kind of we are in the um star tours star tours yeah the little droid is like thank you for coming


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** If you want to know more, listen to Plot Armor Part 1.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:46]** So if you're starting later, do Part 1, and then this Part 2, and then you can start Part 3.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** Super quick rundown.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** Skipped a bunch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:54]** Skipped a bunch, but that's where Book 2 picks up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** And now, Book 2.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** And now, Book 2.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:00]** Book 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:04]** You're ejected out of the Chimera in these escape pods.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:07]** You have no control over where they're going.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:19]** After what feels like a undeterminable amount of time, you arrive docked somewhere.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:30]** And you are in this weird room that seems like it is sterile and clean and metal panels along the walls.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** Rocky ceiling.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** Does anybody want to take it from there?

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:38]** Should I keep going?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** I'm actually curious.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:44]** I want to point out Vinny, again, joined the show on episode, what was it, 65?

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** No, 62.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:48]** 62?

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** Sorry, I'm terrible.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** My memory sucks.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** But thank you again for joining the show.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** We're really glad to have you.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:56]** Vinny was not a part of any of this starting off.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** So Vinny, I'd really like to have your...

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:21]** perspective as a listener for a lot of this so but okay we can roll back into it we left those escape pods into that room and the room had symbols on the no no doors it didn't even appear to be a door right no there were doors but there was a symbol that was like flashing on it because it seemed like it was malfunctioning

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:27]** And so Dr. OK, Nico were trying to hack it and figure it out.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:35]** Meanwhile, Rick was trying to he realized like this is all some kind of, I don't know, simulation or show or something.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:43]** So he was actually trying to get back out the escape pod and he ended up throwing a grenade out and causing a lot of trouble there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:45]** So, yeah.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:53]** To refresh my memory, because I went back and started listening at 29 this morning, but I didn't listen at the end of 28.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:58]** As the escape pods are leaving, is the ship still intact?

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:01]** I seem to remember it blowing up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:04]** So you should definitely go back and listen to the end of 28.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:10]** I think that's a really key moment to understand more of what happened.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:15]** But as you are leaving the escape pod, the ship is blowing up.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:24]** And it's actually one of the final huge explosions that you feel right before you kind of rocket off into darkness.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** So...

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:29]** To your best bet, the chimera is no more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:33]** But we also saw that part of the room was crumbling as well, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:33]** Yeah.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:38]** So that's the thing is that even when you get out in this new room, there's all this shaking.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:41]** There's all this tremors.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:47]** It seems like the place that you're in, and this comes up again and again, even as we go through, there's a lot of instability.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:53]** It seems like at any point, this place could be possibly going to, something's going to happen.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:56]** And at this point, you have no idea what that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:56 - 00:30:05]** As a listener, I think it was really a neat way to create some unsettling in the story.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:11]** I, in particular, felt just as off-kilter as I imagine you guys did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:15]** I was going to say, it was definitely unsettling for us as players.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** Yeah, it was.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** Yeah.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** So you're in that room.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:25]** I'm going to keep going because and then if you have questions or things you want to talk about, we can stop.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:35]** But you fight some like flying saucer robots that you identify as security robots that come through this iris door in the ceiling.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:38]** And those are pretty easy to take down.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:41]** You're able to get out of there into this next room.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:48]** And this next room is weird because you realize that there are all these fans on the sides of the room, these giant fans.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** And then there are nozzles at the top of the room.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:53]** And you realize that this is some sort of sanitation facility.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:53]** room.

**[00:30:54 - 00:31:01]** So it seems like whatever comes out of the room that you were just in into this room always needs to be sanitized.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:11]** And you're able to actually, if I remember right, you're able to identify that and turn off the whole program before even happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:19]** I believe Nico actually used his sword to cut through the fan blades and actually turn those off from that perspective.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:23]** But there was also the spray or something that I believe Hears was able to have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** Yeah, Hears and Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:30]** I think between the panel on one wall and panel on the other because I think you also realized that the doors were going to shut at the same time.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:32]** It's meant to keep you in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:38]** Is there any information on what is supposed to come through this room or is it too revelatory?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** I wouldn't say it's too revelatory.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:45]** I think it just, it seems like the escape pods leave the chimera.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:50]** They come to this clearly designed place for these escape pods to come into.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:53]** And then everything that leaves those escape pods comes into the sanitation room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:57]** Yeah, I'm still convinced that the escape pods are just on a cable.

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:02]** They slide down right into the spots where they're supposed to because they all evenly fit side by side.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** So they weren't jettisoned.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:05]** They were just released.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** They weren't SpaceX.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:16]** I feel like you'll see why as we talk about it more that this is, it seems to me, kind of like just a board game that we're walking through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:24]** I think it's a proving ground for a facility in which they harvest... The brains?

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:26]** No, the abilities.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:35]** They take people's specimens and they attempt to engineer new things from them.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:41]** In later episodes, our Keshti friend and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** Well, we haven't even gotten there yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:48]** Yeah, no, I don't want to... Look, this is all tied together, right?

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:53]** All of it's evidentiary, and so the sanitation protocol would be like...

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:58]** Now we have to make sure that we don't contaminate all of our other specimens.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** That's weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:00]** I could see that.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:04]** Like the convenient placement of enemies and room environments and stuff.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** But yeah, go ahead.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** Let's continue, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:12]** Well, so from there is when you get into this capital they, right?

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:18]** Because this third room you go into is this computer hub area with doors on either side.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:23]** And that's where you see for the first time confirmed these...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:40]** other creatures the only other creatures that you've seen since being on the chimera and they are dead greys and greys and all the computers were actually like smaller you know because greys are a small creature so like all the computers were smaller than you know medium size


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:58]** And when we say gray, too, I mean, gray is like, if you think of a stereotypical small gray petite alien in pop culture here, I mean, in the pack worlds, grays, I think, inhabit a lot of the same space in our culture where it's kind of like... Emphasis on space.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** There's... Sure.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Right?

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:05]** It's like you live in a world where gods exist, plural, where there are alien races.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:09]** So the idea of having grays is maybe less...

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:33]** outlandish right than it would be in our society personally but in the packed worlds this idea of greys who like abduct manipulate i mean to the to the common person just living their life on absalom station or on castravel or wherever that that's that's not really going to impact them it's a it's a bit of like it's a bit of conspiracy right and so for the starfinder world that happens on the outer rim

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:59]** yeah that's that's never gonna come here so for you to walk in and there are three of them dead with holes blown in the back of their head you're like what crazy yeah but about that same time john drops the first flashback yes so the flashback was marcus the australian no uh he's it's english he's english


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** Same thing.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:11]** Then there was a Sheeran and potentially, possibly Captain Rameem sitting down at a table in a dining area on the Suggesta.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** Is that correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:16]** Which is a Starliner in the drift.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:16]** And they're talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** Seems like some tense negotiations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:25]** A little bit of a... I have a theory about these flashbacks, but I don't know if I should save it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** I think you should, yeah.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:29]** Note it for the very end, once we get through all the flashbacks.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:41]** I was going to ask for John to just go over all the flashbacks in series, but... The biggest thing about this flashback is that you start out in one of the fancy conference rooms on the Suggesta.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** So he confirms it's a flashback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:47]** You said it, and I'm going along with your language.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** I don't think it's a flashback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:55]** Well, it kind of is, but it's not like our flashback, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:12]** It is during this time that both Marcus and the Sheeran are called away because there's some sort of a food fight in the dining hall.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:19]** And as they go in, it seems like the food fight is between both of their children.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** Yeah, Marcus' two boys and one Sheeran.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:31]** And it's at that time that we kind of pan over to the Sheeran being put to bed by...

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:32]** their mother.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** And it's at that time that Sharon can't sleep.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:43]** She's looking out, trying to count the colors in the drift as the Sugesta is cruising through the drift.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:54]** And it's around that time that as soon as their mother leaves, and their mother acting a little weird, but maybe it's just the negotiations.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** Sharon's trying to get to sleep.

**[00:36:56 - 00:37:01]** The young Sharon boy is just thinking, I want to go to sleep.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Wish I could stay up.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:10]** And then in the closet, there are these dark eyes that are reflecting the colors of the drift.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:15]** And the Sharon hears a voice in their head saying that they can't go to sleep.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** And then it's just like black.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:21]** Odd, very odd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:24]** So we now know that was a gray.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Probably a gray in the closet.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** It was looking out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:30]** That's where grays like to stay.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:33]** And we saw the reflective black eyes of this creature as well, right?

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:36]** In that quote unquote flashback.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** Creepiest moment for me was that moment for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:44]** There was a whole debate about, like, can black eyes be seen in the darkness?

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** They're glossy enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:51]** Yeah, they're glossy because the light of the drift is bouncing off them.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** Anyway, so that's that first flashback.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** Flashback, as Kev calls it.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:55]** Bam.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** Flashback.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** Flashback.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:58]** Flashback.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** So...

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:05]** You guys then start to, coming back to the computer hub that you're in, you start to explore the rooms.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:09]** You go to the southern door, and from there, there's a little corridor.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:12]** Seems like, again, this area is very technical space.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:18]** This is when you start to see that there's a lot of diagrams and drawings on the wall that would indicate the way that pipes are run.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:21]** It seems like just the overall design of the place is very technical, like a lab.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:27]** And it's confirmed when you go into this first room, right?

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** Where you find a couple things.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:35]** You fight this weird experimental troll polyp blob.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:42]** Which will give some context to what's going on in the future.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:49]** Before we get to that, there was some hacking going on.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** Ah, good point.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** There was some hacking.

**[00:38:53 - 00:39:01]** And I distinctly remember there was a moment when Nico was trying to hack into one particular module.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:22]** rolls a 20 everyone helps him and still like it's the old picard quote you can do everything right and still fail yeah like that that as a listener was like oh we're in the big leagues now which we pulled those modules right we pulled two or three of them yeah out of the four yeah we pulled two successfully i think in fact


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:27]** Yeah, there were four, and I think there were the one that you failed.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** One was destroyed.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:30]** Yeah, that one that you failed was destroyed.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:37]** The other three you were able to pull, and I think they were bricked, but you could rework them later.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** Do we still have those?

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** I think you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:41]** We should revisit that in book three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:49]** Yeah, now that we have maybe some... Well, we'll get to that, but we're outside of this facility.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** Maybe we can get more


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:51 - 00:40:16]** detail are we though god i hope so at least we're outside of one facility inside of the other facility who knows facility facility section yeah facility section so so before we get there uh so you're in this lab you find this you fight this this weird gooey gross experimental troll polyp thing you call it a polyp which then secures the fact that it it was related to the final boss

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:20]** It was exactly the same thing that you then saw in that fight, but we'll get there.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** So you're going through.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:32]** Don't forget that you also found these, like, big glass containers that were broken, right?

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** And they had this weird goo in them.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:36]** And one of them had the face.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:41]** Yeah, and one of them had a face that you thought looked like Crushed Kazba.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:41]** Yeah.

**[00:40:41 - 00:41:07]** the uh the the shock radio broadcaster and it was a little like that was weird then you also find a pretty cool weapon the living transmutation matrix which allows it is a weapon that can change from one specific type of weapon to another type of weapon as long as you imprint blueprints into the weapon pretty cool which was reflected in the data modules

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Yep.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:08]** Yep.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** So that was the key.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:17]** And I appreciate you bringing that up because those data modules kind of gave you a little bit of a preview of what was going to be in the rooms.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:23]** And then it seems like, oh, okay, this is a central hub for some sort of experiments that are going on in all of these rooms.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:30]** And one other thing I'll note is that I remember, I think it was Nico who was first interacting with the computer.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:34]** And that's when you realize that there's this whole telepathic element between

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:38]** to interfacing with the computers that these grays have.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:52]** So it's a level of sophistication and technology, one, reinforced by the intensity, by the high DC to get into this module, and then two, reinforced by the fact that this is like nothing you've seen before.

**[00:41:52 - 00:42:03]** Again, you know about telepathy, but the idea that you have to use telepathy in order to access all of your computers instead of manually in an analog way doing it is certainly new.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:06]** And two things about that was I found the notes.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:14]** We had a total of 37 for that hack, and we still failed by more than five, which allowed the module to be erased.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:20]** The other thing is that Nico is actually having a really hard time, almost like a transition of his own when that happened.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:28]** It was reaching into his mind, and he was connecting with these computers in a way that didn't make sense.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** Yeah.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** He was changing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:31]** Yeah.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:35]** It was certainly a trying time, I think, for everybody.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:40]** I remember, Rick, you were not as interested in the computers.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** I know Dr. O'Kay and Hears were.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:42]** You were helping.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:44]** You were very involved.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:50]** And so it started to really bring out some dynamics to the party that maybe weren't there before or were changing.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:54]** after going through one intense scenario, now you're in a place where you can't relax.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:58]** You're in a place where you really have to kind of fight for your life in a lot of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:11]** That was a big difference between book one and two, was like book two was constantly pretty much combat and like crazy situations where book one, we had a lot more freedom to kind of take a break, go around, interview people.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** It's totally different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** I think there's a little difference.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:17]** I think one of the bigger differences between book one and book two is

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:23]** Book one had like this invisible timeline because it was like things were happening, but we didn't know it.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:30]** Where book two was like, we know we're going to explode at some point and we can't take a break.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** We got to just get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:34]** And then we debated like, should we sleep?

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:34]** Should we not sleep?

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** You know, for that reason.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:36]** Yeah.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:42]** We gambled on sleeping, which I think ended up being good because we would have died probably otherwise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:58]** We'll get to that because I think you rested very soon after this first experimental lab because you go into the next room over and that's where you've seen to date the only living gray that you've seen.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:05]** And it's in this room that the gray is at a console.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:13]** Very arrogant, immediately is questioning why these subjects are in their space.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:28]** You looking around, you realize that there are brains connected into the ceiling and you think there's a lot of data visually moving around these brains, moving across the whole room, moving into the center console.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:35]** And you think this is something that's, it seems like maybe it's collecting a lot of the data for what's happening in these other rooms.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:42]** And the gray, who I think you found out their name because- Niko heard it in his head.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:47]** Yeah, Niko got the name Xtomi in their head.

**[00:44:47 - 00:45:08]** And so you're thinking, what is going on here when Xeomi is basically saying, I don't know why you're here, but why don't you just go ahead and join me and let me take your brain and you can be used for so much more than your physical bodies would ever allow you to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:11]** He kept calling us subjects.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:16]** He seemed so convinced that we would totally want to do that.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:19]** It's kind of like you and your like intro improv with your pyramid scheme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:23]** As if we would offer up our brains to become part of something.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** Subjects.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:26]** Benny, you raise your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:34]** No, I was going to, like, the moment he made the offer just, like, was role-played so well.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:37]** It was a foregone conclusion.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:43]** Why would they ever not offer their brain up to advance the Grey's cause?

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:46]** But also, like, zero context for what was going to happen.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:52]** So it was really interesting to see that crossroads and how the characters stepped through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:55]** Yeah, I think he also had a bit of a short fuse with...

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:59]** I think you guys were, I think Dr. K was like going across the room, right?

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:04]** Like Dr. K like successfully snuck across the room because you're trying to go to the console.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:11]** And then I know Kevin was trying to walk across the room and then like Nico was stalling and Kev was stalling.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:17]** And it was a pretty short fuse until Xtomi was like, I'm just, I don't have time for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:21]** Well, did Xtomi know that this place was about to blow up?

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:24]** I feel like he wouldn't be so calm and calm.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** You know what I mean?

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:28]** He has this huge experimental database of brains.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:37]** Was he enamored by his research to the point where he ignored all other warnings within the facility?

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:38]** Definitely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:42]** I mean, I think... Or was it not blowing up at that time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** Well...

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:48]** Again, and we can talk a little bit about all of Plot Armor in general.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:57]** Most of my questions will not be direct answers, because obviously there are things that I don't... For you as a player and as a listener, I don't want to totally reveal everything, unless I'm just like, it doesn't matter at all.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:01]** Which, unfortunately for me, the way I DM, most things matter in some way.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:03]** So I won't ever totally do it.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:08]** But I will say, it seems like it makes sense that Xtomi...

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:10]** didn't really care.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:14]** The other greys seemed like they were dead, but Xtomi wasn't.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:18]** So no one was like, hey, Xtomi, stop drinking your coffee.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** There's something going on.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:22]** So maybe Xtomi felt the vibrations.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** Maybe heard something.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:27]** Was aware, but the data foundry didn't stop working.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** Things are working.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** Still got a job to do.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:33]** Still enjoying using his brains.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** The alarms are going off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:37]** He was a slave to the Prime Directive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Yeah.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** Hey, yo.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:40]** Hey, yo.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:56]** And then XDOMY, unfortunately, had some... I will say XDOMY had some cool spells that I think were... In rounds one and two, I was having you guys make the rolls for it, but you guys passed because you're capable adventurers and capable heroes, and you passed.

**[00:47:56 - 00:48:00]** So, unfortunately, it wasn't as cool for me, but it was still an awesome battle, I thought, because

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:21]** you're fighting a gray again literally in like game time probably maybe all of what 10 15 20 minutes ago you see dead grays and then half an hour later you're like i'm talking to a gray who like wants to take my brain but that would be like me walking out of this room right now and seeing dead grays like in my apartment and then walking upstairs and talking to a gray i'd be like the hell


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:25]** Yeah, they exist in the game, but they don't exist.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:27]** People don't realize these things are real.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:36]** They think it's all some kind of... They think it's children stories or weird, crazy science that nobody understands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:46]** I think it's interesting, just as a side note, that this idea that it doesn't matter how advanced or where you are as a civilization or as a society.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:50]** There are still things that are accepted as normal and there are things that are not normal.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** So it doesn't matter how advanced you are.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:56]** There are still things that you will be like, that's not going to happen.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** There's no way.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** There's no way it's going to happen, right?

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** So we start going from there.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** You finish the fight.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:04]** You're like, you know what?

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:07]** Let's go into the next room and keep going.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:13]** And I'll let Kev in one minute tell me why that was his favorite part of book two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** Oh my god, I hated it.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:19]** I don't even remember the rules on it, but it was a Greybounder.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** And a Greybounder is a feral Grey that we learned about.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:34]** It was a ravaged wild dog version of Greys that had an uncanny ability to strike us and could not be hit at all.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:43]** So we very quickly decided to retreat because Rick was almost killed and I think somebody else got knocked down pretty hard.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:45]** So we were backed out and decided to go find another route.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:50]** And the other route, we ran into a ferrule ooze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:55]** You ran into a ferromagnetic ooze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:23]** pharaoh fluid ooze pharaoh not pharaoh pharaoh and you fight that derived from pharis yes the god of iron the creator of the wheel also known as iron man also a pharis wheel is an arrangement of eight pharis atoms so this is good to know that's awesome


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:36]** One thing that I want to add is you go then into this room where immediately as soon as you cross the threshold into the room, you get this sense of fear and despair and dread in your entire being.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:40]** And it's at that point that you're attacked by what is this Bolita.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** It's like an insectoid.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:46]** And you think that they are probably under the influence of this fear.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** So I forget who it was.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:51]** Somebody found out that there are probably loudspeakers.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:55]** I think it was either Dr. K or Hears who crossed to the other side of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** I think it was Rick, actually.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:03]** Rick walked in with his hands up because he realized there was something going on with this Belita that was not normal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:30]** and he was trying to convince the bolita like hey don't attack us and that's when he noticed the the speakers in the room and made that connection of this this is some kind of sonic vibration that's causing fear yeah so we all took turns taking out the speakers and we tried not to fight the bolita but as soon as that sound stopped the bolita perished falls to the ground and then dies in rick's arms

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:36]** I think, yeah, Rick had a really hard time with that because it was the first time we knew that the Belita was not a hostile.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** It was forced into that.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:44]** But at the same time, it was the first non-combatant that we met off of the Chimera.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:51]** It was the first time we didn't run into somebody that was trying to kill us in these rooms, at least openly.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:57]** And he realized that Belita was just a victim, much like we are in that case.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:58]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** You leave that room.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:02]** Tragic episode.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:08]** You leave that room, go into the last room that you know is there before you think you have to go back to the room with the gray bounder.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** And you're in this room that was clearly evacuated.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:24]** There's almost nothing in this room except for this giant set of ice that is filling up this huge notch crack in the wall and the ceiling.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:40]** And I think it was there that you also felt the sense of like, that's when you put two and two together, that you had a module about an experimental weapons lab, you had a module about the sphere frequency, and then you had a module about this, some sort of like messing with biology.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:45]** and you got this sense that there was demonic things going on there.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:49]** There was a lot of horrible things that had been happening in that room, but there's nothing else in the room.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:52]** Are we allowed to now know what that ice is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:55]** Yeah, can you tell us more about that, or are you going to try to keep this a secret?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** That's a really good question.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** So, I mean, if you think about it,

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:05]** That ice seemed like it was some sort of emergency sealant, I think, if you had gone through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** I think we figured that out at the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:17]** Yeah, so again, when you're thinking about now, what you know now about the bombardment on this place, on Omicron, then you think that maybe that affected that room.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:24]** Things were then pulled out of the room, sucked out, and then that sealant held everything up.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:29]** The supernatural evil from this extra planar magic is what you think.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:32]** Maybe there was something going on here.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:38]** And I think it was – that was when you were thinking that – that –

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:48]** What I'll tell you is that it seems like maybe this had something to do with this creation of this troll and some other things that were going on with it.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:52]** So maybe that magic and that work was starting in this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** Yeah.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:54]** Interesting.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:58]** Was there anything we could have done in that room that would have...

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** activated something?

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** We talked about thawing the ice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:19]** You could have thawed the ice, and the room would have depressurized, and there would have been a lot of reflex saves, which I'm prepared for, if you guys wanted to do that, to be sucked into the crack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:22]** Other than that, it was more of a clue room.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:24]** That room was just there to deliver information to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** Okay.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:55]** interesting yeah so i feel like the because if you think about the chimera like as an object it's a it's a collection of other animals and using all of their best attributes to make a new thing right so you know we we've seen in the astrozoa where they took the or worse i'm assuming anyway uh they took the shape-changing uh aspects and made the transmutation matrix

**[00:54:55 - 00:55:06]** Um, they've somehow created sound to make fear, uh, which we'll talk about, I guess, later in their telepathic alarms, but like what, what were they, what did they need from the Belita?

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:09]** I think that's, that's the part that I missed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:11]** kind of testing the fear on it.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:13]** Yeah, they're testing the fear.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** She was just a test subject.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** Poor guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:19]** But the Chimera is the ship that we were on.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:26]** And yeah, the Chimera had eaten the Dreamliner Dream... Dreamcast?

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:28]** Star Dreamer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** The Star Dream 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** Star Dream 2.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:39]** So we know that the Chimera was also this amalgamation of different ships.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:46]** One of the things I had in the notes was that the Grey didn't seem interested in what was going on on the Chimera.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:49]** He didn't care that we came from the Chimera.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:51]** He was just like, you're two other test subjects.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:56]** I'm going to turn your brains into hard drops.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:59]** It was like his world was just that room.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:04]** So it was almost like we're on a lab of some sort and the Chimera was just one other project going on.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** And we run into that a little bit later with the monitor.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** So we'll come back to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:10]** So you leave, you're like, there's no other place to go.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** We have to fight this Greybounder.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** That was a very tough fight.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:20]** Probably one of the first ones that even on the Chimera, there were some, let's call them tough fights for like levels one through three.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** Right.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:25]** But that I think was the first one where you really were fighting against something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** Book two really ramped up hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:32]** And I know I rant and rave about it and I complain a lot, but I really do love Starfinder.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:40]** And I do think there was just like a huge leap in difficulty from book one to book two that was unsurprising or was very surprising.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** It was unsurprising.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** It was not surprising.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** I wasn't surprised at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:45]** Yeah.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:50]** And we've talked about this before, you know, the way that enemies in Starfinder are...

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:56]** are typically going to hit more and typically have like one or two things that they're really good at.

**[00:56:56 - 00:57:03]** And it just depends on where you're at and your composition as a party as to whether that is very tough for you or whether that is very easy for you.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:09]** I mean, in D&D, there's a lot of the same things too, but book two definitely has a little bit more of like a,

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:28]** dungeon crawl feel where it's room by room and you're fighting in these confined spaces and you're trying to figure things out and there's all this there's this environmental hazards going on and there are other people it's like so you know you knew that there were going to be some tricky things especially when you think that book one on the face of it didn't have as many encounters as a whole

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:28]** Right?

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:31]** It had as many encounters as there were in this first part of book two.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:34]** Anything else about the Great Bounder that you want to rant about, Kev?

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** Now that you've had some time to cool off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:38]** No, that was just, I think that fight really caught me off guard.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:43]** I think caught all of us off guard because we didn't realize it had the ability to phase

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:45]** And it phased into the room.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** We were like, oh, shut the door and it will protect us.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:51]** But then it just crawled through the door and ended up right in between all of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** The second time, yeah.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** It's an OP creature.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** Very OP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:55 - 00:58:01]** And then I had one of those ultra fails, a critical fail where I threw my axe behind me.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** And luckily Dr. O.K.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** was able to hand it back to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** Thanks.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:05]** Yeah.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** That was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** That was classic.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:10]** Can we talk about the moment it came through the door for a minute?

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** Sure.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:17]** I feel like in book one, even though there were moments of peril, there was always like, oh, we can just go back to our stateroom and rest.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:22]** There was always a home base to feel safe in.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:26]** And that was the moment where the entire party was like, okay, cool.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:29]** There's four inches of steel between us and whatever this is.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:32]** So we have a moment to breathe and to plan and do what we need to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:54]** and then it's you know here's johnny yeah and it was it was a uh a fake comfort because like we did that earlier where we we left we retreated and we stayed right in that next room and we rested for a full eight hours yeah and that graybounder never came through those doors even though it could have but we were we had a false sense of security after that we're like oh we're safe

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:59]** And so when that thing came through the door after that, we were completely shocked.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:03]** And it was just like, oh, the Grey Banner chose not to come through.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:05]** It wasn't like it couldn't.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** It just didn't want to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:07]** Yeah.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:10]** It really cemented the idea that nowhere is safe on this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:10]** Yeah.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:18]** And which is, I think, another juxtaposition to book one, which just as you said, Benny, at any point you're like, all right, then I go back and rest and do whatever.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:22]** And then it really is like as soon as you leave the chimera,

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:40]** everything then like your whole notion of what just happened is like wait a minute now i'm questioning everything and i wasn't questioning anything up until that point and then now that you're here you're like great it's fine and again this book just really drives home this paranoia anyway we'll come to it again so you uh

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:44]** You finish that fight, then you go and start exploring more labs.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:52]** You're in this giant space where there's a vending machine that is lit up and that has all these cola flavors that you know.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:58]** Rick has this weird experience with the vending machine.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:01]** It seems to recall something for him.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:03]** Yeah.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:06]** You fight a little plush toy.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:13]** This room was weird because there was less of these sinister experiments of fear and captivity.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:21]** And it seemed like there were all these bobs and bibs and weird little trinkets and tchotchkes on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:23]** There was a vending machine with Shasta's in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:27]** Yeah, with like cola on it.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:39]** Yeah, well, with Fanta and a pretty well-known... Well, I think that was part of it, is that there was only purple Fanta, which is the least best Fanta.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:45]** And then you fight this little plush shearing toy.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:45]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:46]** The Orange Fanta?

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** Get out of here.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** We should talk about that later.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** That's ridiculous.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** Fusion Fizz.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:51]** A whole other episode.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:52]** Yeah.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** Platinum War Part 2.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** Part 2.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:56]** So... Long live Slice.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** Long live Slice.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:02]** At this point, I think you guys had just rested.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:03]** Also, thank you for a shout out to Slice.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:04]** Dude, can we get sponsored by Slice?

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:07]** Of all things to be sponsored by, that would be so cool.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:10]** Anyway, so at this point, it's when you guys are resting.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** You're like, all right, you know what?

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** We should get going.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:18]** You skip one room that you look in and you think, doesn't seem like there's anything in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:20]** Because we learned there were two.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:23]** Each room was marked telepathically with a creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:29]** One was the Oma, which is like a whale type character or a koi, a giant koi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:33]** Yeah, one... Well, yeah, like a giant space whale, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:35]** And the other one was called a... Kyokor.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:35]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:40]** A Kyokor, which is a giant... And by giant, I mean, like, gargantuan.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** It is essentially a Godzilla creature.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** Like a planet destroyer.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:44]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:44]** Yeah.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** We chose not to go in that room, because fuck that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:55]** And then you go into the room with the Oma, and that's when you meet this weird little creature that's... It's like a... Okay, so wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:56]** Back up.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** Just wait.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:57]** Slow down.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:58]** Um...

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:01]** Can you tell us what was in the other room?

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** Or are you holding out on us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** I thought that you looked in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** I don't even know if we opened the door.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** I think we glanced through the window.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:10]** That's what I'm saying.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:14]** I thought you glanced through the window and you saw that there were some security robots in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** And so we would have fought the security robots and that was the end of it?

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:19]** There was nothing special in there that we could have found?

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** I'm not going to say...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:25]** If there's anything special that you should have found and you didn't, then it will either come up or it won't.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** You should tell us in this episode.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:26]** That's the whole point of plot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:31]** Or, like, it was a clue that we'll stumble across later.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:36]** Like, this is my whole thing with... What's your whole thing?

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:47]** Not to get on a soapbox, but, I mean, I like the story as the story, and I don't need to delve into what-if possibilities, because...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:49]** I just want to know mechanically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:51]** What if that is part of the future story?

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]** If it's not part of the future story, then yeah, I want to know.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:56]** But maybe.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:56]** But if not, then yeah.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** I'll tell you this.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:58]** But I'll understand.

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:00]** I respect if you don't want to say it, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:09]** When you were saying before that you got this idea suddenly that you're like, oh, the chimera and everything that happened in that giant room was one thing.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:12]** It seems like there are other things going on here.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:23]** You might have found some stuff in there that would hint at other technology and things that the Greys are dabbling in, working in, working on.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:23]** Makes sense.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:23]** Okay.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:25]** I'll take that answer.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:27]** Because now we can roll into the armor room.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:36]** We go into the armor room and we come across a monitor, which is it's two rings and the rings kind of turn into a robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:37]** It's like a ring pyramid.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** Pyramid Scheme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:48]** Pyramid Scheme basically is determined to get you as test users to try out these experiments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:49]** And it knew there were four of us.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:55]** So that's a question I do have, and hopefully you can answer, is like, did it already know that there were four of us?

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** Because it was already chosen, like, which four?

**[01:03:57 - 01:04:00]** Or was it just whoever came into that room, the monitor would have chosen...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:06]** It seems like the Monitor's prime directive was to have these experiments figured out.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:07]** Yeah.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:09]** Ready for whoever came in.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:34]** okay okay so it wasn't specifically for dr okay nico here's and rick right and what was weird though was again some of the experiments were they they all had a good thing and they all had a bad thing some of the one was like a cred stick then also like implanted something in your uh arm and then would like dissolve and burn you but then and then there was the glasses that like would allow you to you know with the

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:38]** Yeah, would like allow you to look into the fifth dimension, but then also made you nauseous.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:39]** And then Dr. O.K.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:40]** was able to.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:44]** Who didn't want to take it?

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:44]** Rick.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** Rick.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:46]** Rick didn't want to take it.

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:56]** I think it was Dr. K was able to successfully kind of like confuse the monitor a little bit and be like... With the help of Hears telepathically interfacing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** Yes.

**[01:04:57 - 01:05:03]** And basically, I imagine that we DDoSed its sort of decision making.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:04]** Yes.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:07]** And then allowed it to... Rerouted it.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** Yeah.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:10]** To just overflow onto...

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:11]** Another subject.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:12]** Yeah.

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:14]** And rule out the other subject.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:16]** And so you got two of those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:19]** Well, the second one he didn't do.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:19]** Oh, that's right.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:21]** He like side swashed it.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:21]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:24]** You were supposed to take the cola.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** That was smart.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:26]** That was smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:27]** Slight of tendrils.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:28]** Yeah.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:29]** And then that was it.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:37]** So you all have these weird conditions that I think were interesting in that they're small things.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:39]** They don't always help you out.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:40]** They don't always hurt you.

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:44]** But in the right situation, they would, right?

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:50]** You would either get nauseous or you would fail like a certain check or you would have a penalty or a bonus to a certain check.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:54]** And I think they really didn't come up until the very end when you were reliving that memory.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:58]** But I don't think there was ever a situation where anybody did anything and used that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:02]** I think the only one I remember was Heroes.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:08]** Heroes' thing was if he failed a roll, a natural one, then he would be teleported 15 feet or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:10]** It was in a random direction, yeah.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:14]** You go through the fail the other dimension back into this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:34]** yeah that actually never came up yeah not yet and was it until the end of this book or is that ad infinitum is that forever like these like you can answer that sorry uh i thought there actually was something i think yeah i think it was kind of for the rest of this book is is the intention so this no longer applies these uh

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:36]** Yeah, it had a certain thing.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:38]** It had a certain timeline in it.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:43]** But I think it was like Dr. K who saw that there were nanites in the paste.

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:47]** Yeah, the dentine, whatever.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:51]** Yeah, and that lasted for only an hour, right?

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:53]** Which is why nothing ever came from it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:56]** I thought it lasted for the book, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:57 - 01:07:01]** That was the other one that you took, which was the can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:02]** And that one...

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:03]** Oh, really?

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:06]** Yeah.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:15]** So I've been having high charisma, and I had all this logic for when I fail, I think like a fortitude or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:23]** Yeah, so if you fail a will save, then you would have that penalty.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:28]** We probably missed it because there's also the one where if you missed an attack...

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:31]** Although this was the one that you didn't actually take.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:40]** And the penalty was that if you missed an attack, you would have a minus one penalty to attack rolls, perception checks, and anything that takes more than a standard action to complete, which is pretty wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:42]** That's a horrible one.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:43]** Yeah.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:45]** And I'm glad I didn't take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:45 - 01:08:07]** also i'm glad i didn't take it yeah i'm glad that you didn't take it and uh but again i think we forgot about it because that's how games are and you forget about things but what would i hampered your murder in a bit huh just a little i just wish that i kept the goggles that's the only regret i have yeah so those vanished in into the fifth dimension right yeah so so you couldn't even get them


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:08]** So cool.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:10]** So we left the monitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:10]** Yeah.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:11]** And this is a big thing that happens next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:19]** I think what Dr. OK did avoided a combat with the monitor, which we were not prepared for anyways, because we just got done fighting everything else.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:26]** So then we move on and we go through the next door into a long hallway.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:31]** And in that hallway, at the very end of the hallway, we see three green orbs.

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:41]** And then one of those orbs appears right next to Nico, and a dinosaur with a diamond-shaped head steps out, and Nico touches it?

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:46]** Only for it to eat his arm off and cut him in half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:51]** As the green orb appears, the portal, Nico puts his hand through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:55]** And then it's just infatuated by this technology and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:55]** Yeah.

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:57]** He's like, just wondering what this is.

**[01:08:57 - 01:09:02]** And that's when this giant Raptor dinosaur comes through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:04]** That may be occurred.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:12]** Yeah, that was a big thing was he was starting to like turn inward and look for the truth in what was going on because there was so much around you.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:12]** Right.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:15]** That it was all very mystifying.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:26]** Unfortunately, that dinosaur did deal a lethal blow to Nico, who then crashed into the wall, denting the metal in the floor.

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:28]** and then you all had a pretty tough fight.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:30]** I think Dr. Okay.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:30]** Went down.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:32]** Rick was about to go down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:35]** You were Rick was one, one hit point away from falling.

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:36]** Yeah.

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:39]** Um, and then the last one just vanishes.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:42]** And I, I thought for sure it was cause I was bitching so bad about that fight.

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:43]** Cause I was just like, what the hell?

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:48]** Ah, um, but I, it, it vanishes.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:57]** And I, I am curious now we'll talk about this a little later about the room we came upon, but like what happened to these creatures that went back into the, yeah, that's,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:57 - 01:10:20]** no so in the book it says nearly kill the last one kill a character and then disappear well uh we'll talk about it more when we get to the troll on the end and uh the diamond dogs but yeah no this is all that was not a conscious attempt for me to nerf it uh because it felt like it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:22]** I was like, oh, this is plot over for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:25]** Which, to be fair, is a thing.

**[01:10:25 - 01:10:33]** If you think of D&D games where you're level one and you fight a dragon, it's a little like there's no way that you're actually going to kill a dragon.

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:37]** So there are usually conditions for which there's a period in which you might die.

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:42]** And then you're probably not going to actually kill a dragon because dragons are way too powerful for you.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:43]** But this was not one of those cases.

**[01:10:43 - 01:10:44]** But you can steal its eggs.

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:46]** But you can steal its eggs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:49]** And raise one on your own.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:54]** This is where this book and maybe this whole series is really just like.

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:59]** just screws with your mind because it's like, you're not safe.

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:00]** OK, you're safe.

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:01]** Then you're not safe.

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:02]** OK, then you're safe.

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:03]** And then you're not safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:04]** It's yeah.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:05]** Yeah.

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:08]** When when orbs can literally appear out of nothing, you're not right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:09]** You're not safe anywhere.

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:10]** You're not safe anywhere at all.

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:12]** And then we come into the next room.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:19]** Here's this, like, pinging noise that's just like a message, like, on your phone.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:20]** Like, your phone keeps vibrating.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:22]** Yeah.

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:23]** This telepathic message.

**[01:11:23 - 01:11:25]** And so we follow it to a room.

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:31]** We open that room, and there's an Abador core Guardian drone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:33]** Robot, yeah.

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:34]** Guardian robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:37]** And so, again, like, we...

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:40]** Rick worked for Abadar Corps.

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:41]** Abadar Corps.

**[01:11:42 - 01:11:43]** Abadar Corps.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:48]** And for him to see that bot, it was almost like a sign of relief.

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:51]** And then it turned on us.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:52]** Yep.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:54]** And again, it's one of those trust issues.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:56]** You can't trust anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:56 - 01:11:56]** Yep.

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:58]** That was a pretty tough fight, too.

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:59]** But there were a lot of crits.

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:00]** You got lucky.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:02]** But also, you fought well.

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:05]** Because you, I think, were just trying to do your best.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:09]** And I think now that you were down to three, you were like, we need some strategy.

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:12]** And you started to really break out into... Rolling crits on purpose?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:13]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:14]** You crit on purpose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:20]** Part of that, too, was I think you forgot there was a crit weakness for this creature until the next episode.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:22]** Like, we ended on... Yeah.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:26]** And it was the next episode, you were like, oh, by the way, there's a weakness for crits, so this thing should be dead already.

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:33]** Which, again, just as a GM, like, sorry, Kev, because you're about to GM, but you're going to make mistakes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:35]** You're going to forget something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:37]** Wait, what, Kev?

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:37]** Nothing.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:38]** I didn't hear you said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:40]** Nothing.

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:45]** So we killed the bot, and then we answered the call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:49]** Kev's going to perform his GM duties perfectly, is what he said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:52]** I was going to say, Kev is going to be a flawless GM.

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:54]** He's not going to forget a single thing.

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:57]** If you go back and listen, I think it's episode 26, 27.

**[01:12:57 - 01:13:02]** If you listen to the outro, you can hear a bit of what Hears was hearing in his head.

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:04]** And we played it during the episodes.

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:08]** But that one in particular, you could start to hear kind of what was going on.

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:10]** And you answer the call, and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:38]** who was it the way from when the stewards yeah yes yeah yeah yeah it's the stewards sure question yeah stewards come along shay and um narla and narla yeah and then they tell us that there's the that the reactors that there are reactors here and they're timing down to blow up and they're trying to disable one and they need our help to disable the other yep and they tell us there's a limited amount of time and we


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:39]** Put some pep into your step.

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:47]** I think the message that you had heard from them was them signaling to this place saying, hey, there's some illegal activity.

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:53]** Please comply or else we will pursue further activity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:53 - 01:13:58]** You're in an illegal biomedical facility or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:58 - 01:13:59]** Yeah.

**[01:13:59 - 01:14:01]** We can go over that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:07]** So before we go any further, we did forget that we leveled up at that point somewhere in there.

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:10]** And that's when Dr. OK got Bernice.

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:11]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:11]** Yeah.

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:16]** But the first time he brought Bernice in, she was just a cloud of nanobytes, which is an amazing idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:25]** But we decided that's a little too... Just wasn't supported by the... The Sage drone is such a not...

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:51]** we're talking about tech revolution yeah it's a tiny it's a tiny drone which is like it's a tiny drone and that's fine and that fits for a briefcase but it doesn't fit a cloud of nanites which you know would have been freaking cool and i uh i'll be honest briefcase bernice is so much better than nanobyte pretty bernice yeah yeah we love her as a briefcase i know it's true

**[01:14:51 - 01:15:21]** it's also hilarious to think like a briefcase with a knife stick in it which in hindsight is the worst configuration for Bernice to have from a weapon standpoint because her melee is like terrible and thank you Aiden one of our one of the willing for drawing Bernice for us beautiful picture amazing it was awesome the willing art


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:24]** So this is when you find the relax you.

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:27]** Dr. OK goes out, tries it out.

**[01:15:27 - 01:15:30]** Here's some Rick go to pay their respects to Nico's body.

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:31]** That's when you step out.

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:37]** Two more green orbs appear and these like diamond laser Tashitari dogs appear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:37 - 01:15:43]** That was also Roy and Ted Lasso step out of the green orbs.

**[01:15:43 - 01:15:44]** Diamond dogs.

**[01:15:44 - 01:15:44]** Diamond dogs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:45 - 01:16:09]** and uh and then you have that fight and then what one of them goes to the orb and then the other body vanishes in the green flash yeah that fight was also kind of hard but we i think we managed to like figure out a little one of the weaknesses pretty early on we're able to take yeah you know also get the upper hand here's did a cool thing with making that sound in the adjacent hallway distract yeah to distract and kind of sound and kind of pull focus yeah that was cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:11]** We're out of ideas.

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:14]** I was just like, whatever we can do, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:21]** Throw every ability we have at every... We went back to D&D days where we were like, we're going to float a goblin's head.

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:24]** Smoke screens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:25 - 01:16:31]** Move its lips and try to... Make it talk and throw a voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:32]** Every fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:33]** Every fight.

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:35]** So now you're like, great, how do I find this reactor?

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:41]** You're at a fork in the corridor, the fork in the lab, and you need to go left or right.

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:51]** You choose to go one way, and you essentially come past a door that spikes on Dr.

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:54]** O.K.

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:57]** 's measurement device as emanating radiation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:57 - 01:16:59]** Yeah, this is, again, one of those rooms I'd like to talk about.

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:06]** Like, we didn't go in there, and I think it's... It makes a lot of sense that our characters didn't want to go in there because they've already been on the verge of death multiple times.

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:08]** Like, we're not going to go into random rooms for no reason.

**[01:17:09 - 01:17:14]** I think offline, we talked about how you really wanted us to go in that room, but there really was no draw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:16]** I thought that it would be cool, but...

**[01:17:16 - 01:17:18]** Yeah, I wasn't going to force your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:18 - 01:17:21]** So by it'll be cool, can you tell us what it'll be cool means?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:17:21 - 01:17:21]** No, I can't.

**[01:17:22 - 01:17:22]** I can't.

**[01:17:22 - 01:17:25]** Because then it takes away the mystery of it.

**[01:17:25 - 01:17:26]** And I can't say what was in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:31]** There's probably clues as to other things that he's yet to reveal.

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:32]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:34]** I think this is part of the argument about plot armor, though.

**[01:17:34 - 01:17:38]** Like, this is the time for you to say, like, yeah, if you would have gone to the room, this is what would have happened.

**[01:17:38 - 01:17:46]** And we already said, spoiler, if you're going to listen to, if you're going to play or listen to anything that is threefold conspiracy, then don't listen to this episode because you're going to know.

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:50]** And so unless you're going to use that again somewhere else for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:52]** It could lead into other things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:53 - 01:18:00]** But like, mechanically, we're never going to be back on this asteroid unless we are.

**[01:18:00 - 01:18:02]** There's no possible way.

**[01:18:03 - 01:18:05]** We'll get to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:06]** Why don't we come back to it at the very end?

**[01:18:07 - 01:18:09]** So you keep going down the hall.

**[01:18:09 - 01:18:11]** Oh my god.

**[01:18:11 - 01:18:14]** This is the episode where Kev just loses it.

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:15]** Yeah.

**[01:18:15 - 01:18:17]** Well, that's happened a lot of times.

**[01:18:17 - 01:18:19]** You find these weird storage bins and sleeping pods.

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:27]** These are like the Grey's sleeping quarters, including you find all this floating array of these colored cubes that have all these trinkets in them.

**[01:18:27 - 01:18:33]** And it seems like the Grey's, you know, they are known for abduction and

**[01:18:33 - 01:18:56]** now all this other crazy technology and you find all these trinkets that seem like they're from all over the packed worlds including this little uh olfactory the the olfactory nose that you put on your nose and it gives you a pleasant memory but when you use it i'll admit i'm i'm an idiot and i don't know big words and so i i was like old factory


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:18:56 - 01:18:56]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:18:56 - 01:18:57]** What is an old factory?

**[01:18:57 - 01:18:58]** The old factory.

**[01:18:58 - 01:19:01]** Now I know whenever I hear olfactory that it means, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:01 - 01:19:04]** Your nasal area.

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:04]** System.

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:05]** System.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:19:06 - 01:19:06]** Yeah.

**[01:19:06 - 01:19:09]** That's because we'll say we like to teach as well as play.

**[01:19:09 - 01:19:10]** Starfinder teaches you things.

**[01:19:10 - 01:19:11]** Starfinder teaches you things, yeah.

**[01:19:12 - 01:19:22]** Uh, but weirdly when you put it on, you do have a pleasant memory of, you know, for some of you, it was like, it was like, it seemed to be like an academic sense, whatever it was.

**[01:19:23 - 01:19:27]** Uh, and then it just like, you rip it off because it comes foul and gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:28 - 01:19:52]** weird you keep going down you discover a creature that you nope out of there this weird little like mini sand dune thing yeah it's okay to walk away hashtag it's okay to walk away hashtag it's okay to run away yeah no i would i didn't want to fight that thing it literally came out of like a disgusting red mass of like bodies that didn't we have to make like uh like a save like a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:53 - 01:19:56]** Some kind of psychological thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:19:57 - 01:20:00]** Yeah, because it seemed like it was trying to really pull your attention.

**[01:20:00 - 01:20:02]** And be able to fascinate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:03 - 01:20:09]** And we knew it was a dead end at least because that door was like red and that was the only door and we weren't going to be able to open that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:14]** Was that creature based off of Veracinea like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:20:15 - 01:20:16]** It was not Veracinea.

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:17]** No, it seemed like it was.

**[01:20:17 - 01:20:20]** But good connection thought, but it was not Veracinea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:21 - 01:20:23]** It felt like a flesh golem or something.

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:25]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:25 - 01:20:25]** What's a Veracinea?

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:26]** Am I just dumb?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:31]** That was the carnivorous plant where we found.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:32]** Oh, the plants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:20:32 - 01:20:32]** The plants.

**[01:20:33 - 01:20:34]** So you go back.

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:52]** go back the way you came because you're like this is a dead end and i will say here there was one room that you skipped and it's not the one that you're thinking of there was a doorway that you didn't go in at all and i'm gonna be completely honest yeah there was another door that you didn't go in

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:56]** Because ahead of you was, like, there were two doors off to your right.

**[01:20:56 - 01:21:00]** One of them was, like, kind of partially open, and there were, like, liquids trailing out of it.

**[01:21:00 - 01:21:01]** You didn't go into that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:21:01 - 01:21:03]** Yeah, there's a room to the left next to the comm room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:04 - 01:21:05]** There was one to the left that you didn't go in.

**[01:21:05 - 01:21:08]** And I'm just going to tell you, I was worried about that room.

**[01:21:09 - 01:21:15]** Because the way that the book had it, and I even talked to Jeremy.

**[01:21:15 - 01:21:17]** I, like, looked some things up.

**[01:21:17 - 01:21:18]** I was like...

**[01:21:18 - 01:21:25]** If they go into that room, as a GM, I had a tough decision.

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:26]** A TPK moment?

**[01:21:27 - 01:21:32]** I had a TPK moment of if this does not go well, I feel like it could TPK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:21:32 - 01:21:33]** Can you reveal that to us at all?

**[01:21:34 - 01:21:35]** What do we miss out on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:35 - 01:21:44]** a creature that was very tough that would have tied in, I think a lot to some of the technology that you notice, right?

**[01:21:44 - 01:21:49]** So again, you saw this fusion fizz can from the monitor had like nanites in it and like nanosites.

**[01:21:49 - 01:21:53]** And so that was your first clue that maybe there's something

**[01:21:53 - 01:22:12]** that the greys were working on with that technology you skip the lab kyokuro room maybe you would have found out more about that you skip this room maybe you would have found out more about that technology and about some of the creature i don't want to give it away because you know maybe something else will come up but in a sense all i'm doing is our gray hosts

**[01:22:12 - 01:22:19]** Yeah, and all this does is in the future, if you see this kind of technology, it will make you think of that.

**[01:22:19 - 01:22:30]** Because as far as nanites and nanocytes, I also feel like while that's not a rare technology, it's probably not something that just day-to-day you're going to come across something that's made of nanites.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:22:30 - 01:22:33]** And the way it is by these grays.

**[01:22:33 - 01:22:35]** So now it's a standout in your character's minds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:22:35 - 01:22:36]** I will say...

**[01:22:36 - 01:22:42]** I am actually a lot more satisfied with your non-answers than I thought I would be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:22:42 - 01:22:43]** Okay, good.

**[01:22:44 - 01:22:45]** I also wasn't hoping for you to be satisfied.

**[01:22:45 - 01:22:47]** I just wanted to tell you what I wanted to tell you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:22:47 - 01:22:47]** I know.

**[01:22:47 - 01:22:48]** You were looking to piss me off.

**[01:22:49 - 01:22:50]** No, I'm not mad.

**[01:22:50 - 01:22:54]** I accept your answers for what they are.

**[01:22:54 - 01:22:56]** I better run into a nanite monster at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:22:57 - 01:22:59]** I both hope and don't hope that you do that.

**[01:22:59 - 01:23:04]** So then you skip a room where there seems to be a lot of fluids coming out.

**[01:23:05 - 01:23:12]** You go into another console lab where... Yeah, but that other room we skipped, the door was broken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:23:12 - 01:23:17]** We could see inside and it was definitely where the creatures were going back to.

**[01:23:17 - 01:23:17]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:23:18 - 01:23:18]** Yeah.

**[01:23:18 - 01:23:29]** So as you go in and you start to like in this other room that you do go in, you discover these little flying bats named Skrillings that you affectionately called Peter and Paul.

**[01:23:29 - 01:23:30]** That was a pretty easy fight.

**[01:23:31 - 01:23:32]** They seem to crawl back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:23:32 - 01:23:38]** Was it because they cheated and they took a bunch of damage on Rick because they got attacks of opportunities for no reason?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:23:38 - 01:23:39]** I don't recall that.

**[01:23:39 - 01:23:41]** I also recall that you made that same mistake at some point in the future.

**[01:23:41 - 01:23:43]** So anyway.

**[01:23:43 - 01:23:44]** Not four times in a row.

**[01:23:44 - 01:23:44]** Okay.

**[01:23:44 - 01:24:01]** So they go back into this other room, and basically you are looking through the computer, and you think that from gauging an analysis of the fluids from that room and everything else, it seems like, as you said, that's where a lot of creatures are kept.

**[01:24:01 - 01:24:07]** And they're blood of creatures that you already fought, like the Tastaris, like the dinosaur raptors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:24:07 - 01:24:13]** Yeah, so you said there were four types of blood in that one mixture that we looked at on the floor.

**[01:24:13 - 01:24:14]** I think Dr. O.K.

**[01:24:14 - 01:24:15]** analyzed it.

**[01:24:15 - 01:24:17]** You said we fought three of them.

**[01:24:17 - 01:24:20]** One was the Diamond Dogs, one was the Dramatos, whatever-saurus.

**[01:24:20 - 01:24:21]** Dromaeosaurus.

**[01:24:21 - 01:24:23]** And then the Skrillings, I think.

**[01:24:23 - 01:24:23]** Maybe?

**[01:24:24 - 01:24:24]** No?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:24:25 - 01:24:32]** Well, so, yeah, you saw that there was blood from the Testari Patrol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:24:32 - 01:24:33]** Just read the full list.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:24:34 - 01:24:43]** And not the Skrillings, Testari, the Dromiosaurid, and also Troll, and also a Keshti.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:24:45 - 01:24:45]** A Keshti.

**[01:24:45 - 01:24:46]** Okay.

**[01:24:46 - 01:24:47]** And we hadn't run into a Keshti yet.

**[01:24:48 - 01:24:52]** So we can assume that it would have been Harag's blood?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:24:52 - 01:24:53]** It's a thought.

**[01:24:54 - 01:24:55]** And you didn't go in there.

**[01:24:56 - 01:24:58]** You could look through and see that there are some containment areas.

**[01:25:00 - 01:25:02]** And it seems like something broke out of there.

**[01:25:02 - 01:25:03]** That's why the door is ripped off.

**[01:25:04 - 01:25:05]** Yeah, it's the troll.

**[01:25:05 - 01:25:06]** The troll broke out.

**[01:25:07 - 01:25:10]** It's a likely case that the troll might have broken out there.

**[01:25:10 - 01:25:13]** It's a likely case that that's where they did some testing, did some analysis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:25:14 - 01:25:14]** Harag broke out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:25:15 - 01:25:20]** It seems like that could have been a place where you could have gotten a sense of what was to come, right?

**[01:25:20 - 01:25:22]** Because now you're like, oh, this is the second time I've seen a troll.

**[01:25:22 - 01:25:27]** Now I'm seeing this Akeshi blood, which if I didn't mention in the episode, you did a full analysis.

**[01:25:27 - 01:25:30]** I'm pretty sure I did because I talked about it and then we just moved on.

**[01:25:32 - 01:25:41]** The other weird thing, though, is that back to this console room that you're in, you find a picture.

**[01:25:41 - 01:25:42]** on this little holodeck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:25:42 - 01:25:43]** Yeah, that was the weirdest part.

**[01:25:44 - 01:25:46]** And one... Kelly, tell us what the picture was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:25:46 - 01:25:48]** Yeah, well, one was the same picture that you saw on the Chimera.

**[01:25:48 - 01:25:50]** It was the picture of Professor Benjamin.

**[01:25:51 - 01:25:52]** Benjamin, sorry.

**[01:25:52 - 01:25:55]** And his Reiforian friend at a dig site on Triaxis.

**[01:25:56 - 01:26:00]** But as you're about to put it down, you scroll over...

**[01:26:00 - 01:26:01]** Swipe left.

**[01:26:01 - 01:26:03]** And what do you see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:26:03 - 01:26:13]** You see here's in a business suit surrounded by on the surrounded by a group of people who look at him like he's some kind of cult leader or something.

**[01:26:13 - 01:26:15]** They just like adore here's.

**[01:26:15 - 01:26:17]** which is great for me.

**[01:26:17 - 01:26:18]** I enjoy yours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:26:19 - 01:26:22]** But Kelly, you didn't know this, right?

**[01:26:22 - 01:26:27]** This is not something in your backstory or something that you know, unless you're keeping secrets from us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:26:27 - 01:26:29]** Are you asking me my official lore?

**[01:26:29 - 01:26:30]** I'm asking you, yes.

**[01:26:30 - 01:26:32]** Are you going to answer or not answer?

**[01:26:34 - 01:26:35]** Oh, come on, man.

**[01:26:35 - 01:26:37]** Like, okay.

**[01:26:37 - 01:26:37]** All right.

**[01:26:37 - 01:26:38]** No, honestly, I did not know.

**[01:26:38 - 01:26:39]** This is totally.

**[01:26:40 - 01:26:41]** And that's the thing, like in game too.

**[01:26:41 - 01:26:46]** That's why I was like, look, I swear, like, I don't know what this is because I didn't want any suspicion to arise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:26:47 - 01:26:51]** And I'm always curious, John, and I'm sure you won't answer it, but like.

**[01:26:52 - 01:26:54]** Is this something that you inserted?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:26:55 - 01:26:55]** I want to hear no.

**[01:26:57 - 01:26:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:26:59 - 01:27:03]** Was this something that you inserted or is it something that was a part of the book?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:27:04 - 01:27:06]** You had to choose a character though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:27:06 - 01:27:16]** Like even, even the picture, even the picture of Dr. Benjamin, was that, is that written into the AP or is that something you're inserting from your own wonderful imagination?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:27:16 - 01:27:20]** I think if I say anything, it's going to... I can't.

**[01:27:20 - 01:27:22]** That is one question that I cannot answer.

**[01:27:22 - 01:27:28]** Because if I say anything, I don't know where your mind is going to link and connect to.

**[01:27:28 - 01:27:30]** So I'm not going to say anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:27:30 - 01:27:31]** Why does it matter?

**[01:27:31 - 01:27:39]** I just want to know at what point is the AP and what point is John?

**[01:27:39 - 01:27:40]** And I guess you're right.

**[01:27:40 - 01:27:43]** As a player, you'd want to blur that line enough that we don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:27:44 - 01:28:11]** which i think because of the question he's successfully doing yeah yeah stay tuned for plot armor at the end of book six when we talk about when i answer all of your questions in full when when john dodges the rest of our questions yeah i still don't know the story we're at the ap now since you've all seen it i just love that is the one where i will tell you this was me this was the book


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:28:11 - 01:28:15]** I will say that I've contacted Jason Keeley on Discord, and he's an amazing dude.

**[01:28:16 - 01:28:21]** And he asked me, like, oh, how did you enjoy – and I forget the name of the book even because I forgot it on purpose.

**[01:28:22 - 01:28:24]** And I was like, is that the name of the book too?

**[01:28:24 - 01:28:27]** Because John doesn't even tell us the names of the titles of these –

**[01:28:28 - 01:28:28]** short adventures.

**[01:28:29 - 01:28:30]** We know three folk conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:28:31 - 01:28:35]** Probably overly so, but I just really want to keep the mystery alive.

**[01:28:35 - 01:28:37]** He hides everything from us.

**[01:28:37 - 01:28:43]** More than a typical campaign, I really want to just have it all be in your heads of what's going on.

**[01:28:43 - 01:28:43]** Anyway, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:28:43 - 01:28:45]** I'm curious.

**[01:28:46 - 01:28:53]** Just to make sure that I'm answering Kevin's earlier question correctly, the people that were surrounding here, what kind of people?

**[01:28:53 - 01:28:54]** Were they just normal people?

**[01:28:54 - 01:28:55]** Yeah, just all.

**[01:28:56 - 01:28:57]** They were just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:28:57 - 01:29:22]** bunch of different people i think a diverse crowd of people diverse crowd star finder universe they didn't like oh here is anything business here is anything in particular why do they love them so much john can you answer they didn't call you sir they didn't say like well what's interesting though is that oh captain yeah yeah so you're looking for some details and you think well there's enough diverse people here that could be a lot of places but you're like

**[01:29:22 - 01:29:28]** I don't know, from like maybe some of the backgrounds seem like like from like the what's architecture in the background.

**[01:29:28 - 01:29:31]** You're like, maybe it's like a bigger place, like like a full station or like Absalom Station.

**[01:29:31 - 01:29:36]** Then you notice that there's an OMA on the sleeve and you're like, oh, that's right.

**[01:29:36 - 01:29:43]** This seems like it is maybe not like like that seems like a common symbol that you would see on other planets.

**[01:29:44 - 01:29:49]** And then you also see that there's a gray in the crowd who's looking at the camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:29:49 - 01:30:09]** yeah that this isn't part of his history that he knows of anyway yeah so that's one of two things like maybe it was and they wiped it from your mind that could be and because they were already injecting themselves into our lives or or they're recreating memories of you or maybe or maybe we aren't even our original selves whatever like clones yeah we're just clones yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:30:09 - 01:30:27]** I'm just saying I'm just a replica I'm gonna make a bold prediction of Rick 18 yeah bold prediction there's 19 of you what a brain wow no I am fully expecting a like Groundhog Day ending to book 6 oh my god yeah

**[01:30:27 - 01:30:29]** Yeah, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:30:30 - 01:30:33]** No offense, but if that's what it is, I'm out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:30:34 - 01:30:35]** Infinity Blade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:30:36 - 01:30:37]** You're like, oh, you boarded the Chimera.

**[01:30:40 - 01:30:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:30:40 - 01:30:41]** You just come right back to the Chimera.

**[01:30:42 - 01:30:44]** And you just wake up again, boarding the Chimera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:30:45 - 01:30:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:30:46 - 01:30:46]** No, man.

**[01:30:47 - 01:30:47]** That would be wild.

**[01:30:48 - 01:30:48]** I can't do it.

**[01:30:49 - 01:30:49]** I can't do it.

**[01:30:49 - 01:30:50]** That would be wild.

**[01:30:51 - 01:30:53]** Can I posit my theory?

**[01:30:53 - 01:30:53]** Please.

**[01:30:54 - 01:30:55]** Please, please, please.

**[01:30:56 - 01:31:14]** I don't know if we've delved into it, but all these flashback, quote-unquote flashbacks, what if these are like the quote-unquote psychic energies that have been harvested by our gray captors who are inserting themselves into our, like...

**[01:31:14 - 01:31:22]** We know Crushed Kazba was in a vat or something.

**[01:31:23 - 01:31:33]** So what if they're trying to manipulate the strings of reality and the remnants of these flashbacks are the quote-unquote mental and psychic energies of the...

**[01:31:33 - 01:31:49]** Imprisoned and captured foes who they've... I shouldn't say foes, but... Encaptured souls of those who have fallen victim to our gray...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:31:51 - 01:32:12]** yeah i don't i'd like to say yes to that but at the same time like i think it's it's not he kept showing us the same characters it was always the sheeran and her son fair targeted and so like i think we're gonna run into them at some point i don't yeah or we're gonna we're gonna learn more or we're gonna run into their great copies yeah my god keep that in mind

**[01:32:13 - 01:32:14]** Anyways, moving on.

**[01:32:14 - 01:32:15]** So there's a ladder down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:32:15 - 01:32:22]** You find a ladder headed down with some troll blood and you're like, this must be the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:32:24 - 01:32:32]** Which I'll be honest because Bernice downloaded the maps and I think we paid really close attention to the map above us or the previous map and this map.

**[01:32:33 - 01:32:35]** Did we have a map of the next floor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:32:35 - 01:32:35]** No.

**[01:32:35 - 01:32:36]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:32:36 - 01:32:37]** Okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:32:38 - 01:32:39]** It's a technical space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:32:39 - 01:32:39]** You didn't have it.

**[01:32:39 - 01:32:41]** Why didn't we use this map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:32:43 - 01:32:44]** And you go down.

**[01:32:44 - 01:32:47]** You discover that there is another entrance.

**[01:32:48 - 01:32:49]** There's like a little bypass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:32:50 - 01:32:53]** Bernice found that on the computer and opened the door in that tunnel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:32:53 - 01:32:55]** And you go down there and you're like, what is this?

**[01:32:55 - 01:33:01]** You discover there are motion sensors in this little tiny hallway, right?

**[01:33:01 - 01:33:02]** This little access shaft.

**[01:33:03 - 01:33:09]** And you discover the motion sensors, you trigger them, and then you find out that they're from Shea.

**[01:33:10 - 01:33:11]** that Shay set them.

**[01:33:11 - 01:33:14]** And he's like, these come over to our side where our reactor is.

**[01:33:15 - 01:33:19]** And there's like, I don't know why you're doing this.

**[01:33:19 - 01:33:21]** Like you should go figure out your reactor.

**[01:33:22 - 01:33:22]** It's kind of weird.

**[01:33:24 - 01:33:25]** I think that's when you first were like,

**[01:33:27 - 01:33:35]** that's when you first started to, to, to, to just think about like, like the paranoia of the whole book, then set in to these people that are helping you.

**[01:33:36 - 01:33:40]** And then you start to second guess them, which I think is the point of the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:33:40 - 01:33:45]** So like Rick, Rick admires the stewards.

**[01:33:45 - 01:33:48]** He trusts the idea of the stewards as a whole.

**[01:33:48 - 01:33:50]** He's very conflicted.

**[01:33:50 - 01:33:55]** I was going to say, lack of a better term, he's a bootlicker.

**[01:33:55 - 01:33:58]** He admires them.

**[01:33:58 - 01:33:59]** He trusts everything they say.

**[01:33:59 - 01:34:05]** And so in this situation, he trusted them completely until this point.

**[01:34:06 - 01:34:08]** He's like, wait, why are they putting these motion sensors?

**[01:34:08 - 01:34:10]** And I think that really broke him down.


## Speaker_0

**[01:34:10 - 01:34:11]** Makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:34:11 - 01:34:34]** it kind of makes sense but at the same time it doesn't like they know i don't know and and we get back to that in the final episode of like man i like rick and kevin both do not trust anything going on anywhere within this campaign well so yeah i don't trust you i think that's the important note right because it based on everything rick and the party has experienced up to this point

**[01:34:34 - 01:34:41]** It makes absolute sense to put motion sensors on your back end because you have no protection back there.

**[01:34:42 - 01:34:42]** Yeah.

**[01:34:42 - 01:34:48]** Conversely, Rick trusts nothing he experiences because nothing has shown itself trustworthy.

**[01:34:48 - 01:34:50]** Everything is trying to kill you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:34:51 - 01:34:51]** Totally.

**[01:34:51 - 01:34:52]** That's how he feels too.

**[01:34:53 - 01:34:57]** I mean, we're always kind of jumping to the worst possible intent at the moment, you know?


## Speaker_0

**[01:34:58 - 01:34:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:34:58 - 01:35:05]** yeah well we i here's just thinking they just don't want us to go there because we're gonna like uncover what they're trying to hide from us yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:35:06 - 01:35:07]** So then you go back.

**[01:35:08 - 01:35:08]** You're like, well, I'm not.

**[01:35:08 - 01:35:10]** Well, here's goes and looks a little bit.

**[01:35:10 - 01:35:12]** And it does seem like it's another shaft.

**[01:35:12 - 01:35:12]** Right.

**[01:35:12 - 01:35:20]** You're like, oh, because the stewards had said, like, just from what we've seen, it's like it seems like there could be a bit of a similar layout situation.

**[01:35:20 - 01:35:20]** I don't know.

**[01:35:20 - 01:35:22]** But like, you'll probably find something similar.

**[01:35:22 - 01:35:24]** You'll find another shaft going down.

**[01:35:24 - 01:35:25]** Then you guys go back.

**[01:35:25 - 01:35:26]** You're like, all right, cool.

**[01:35:26 - 01:35:26]** See you later.

**[01:35:26 - 01:35:27]** You go back down.

**[01:35:28 - 01:35:30]** You're in an even smaller space.

**[01:35:30 - 01:35:41]** And it's in that space that you first look into one room and you see this figure standing in the room and you're like, nope, we want to get to the reactor.

**[01:35:41 - 01:35:44]** We're not going to fight this figure in this weird room.

**[01:35:44 - 01:35:45]** We opened a door.

**[01:35:45 - 01:35:49]** The figure didn't move, standing completely stock still, shrouded in shadows.

**[01:35:50 - 01:35:51]** You can't really see too much of it.

**[01:35:51 - 01:35:52]** Make anything out.

**[01:35:52 - 01:35:53]** You're like, see ya.

**[01:35:53 - 01:35:54]** Hit the door.

**[01:35:55 - 01:35:55]** Door shuts.

**[01:35:55 - 01:35:56]** Yeah.

**[01:35:56 - 01:35:58]** But then you go into another hall.

**[01:35:58 - 01:36:12]** And I don't know where Kev went, but this is important because as you walk into the hall, then you realize that this is some sort of observation space because it seems like there's a big window on one side that you can't really see through.

**[01:36:12 - 01:36:14]** But the hall, the light is flickering.

**[01:36:14 - 01:36:16]** And as you walk in...

**[01:36:16 - 01:36:29]** There's this giant creature that charges out and a Keshti, this huge, jacked, muscular Keshti who charges out and fights you.

**[01:36:30 - 01:36:42]** And what I love is that from the beginning, the first thing that he did was come out, grab like a chunk of the ceiling or the wall and throw it, hurl it like overhand at Rick 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:36:43 - 01:36:47]** So like before, before we explore that, can we talk a bit about what the Kestis are?

**[01:36:48 - 01:36:48]** Sure.

**[01:36:48 - 01:36:49]** Please.

**[01:36:49 - 01:36:49]** Please.

**[01:36:49 - 01:36:49]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:36:51 - 01:36:58]** Hashtag Starfinder story time for the children.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:36:58 - 01:37:01]** I need to get Liliana to record that.

**[01:37:01 - 01:37:04]** Liliana's my daughter for the listeners.

**[01:37:05 - 01:37:09]** So after 10 to 20 years of adolescence, the Keshtis begin to rut.

**[01:37:11 - 01:37:15]** They become violent, single-minded, overcome by their urges to fight and to mate.

**[01:37:16 - 01:37:27]** And basically they will eat and eat and gain new spurs and claws and harden their scales in order to find a partner to mate with.

**[01:37:27 - 01:37:32]** If they find a partner, they mate, fertilizing their clutch of eggs.

**[01:37:32 - 01:37:36]** Then the two partners fight to the death.

**[01:37:37 - 01:37:44]** Their surviving partner will go on to either be a broodminder or a congregant.

**[01:37:45 - 01:37:50]** But in this case, we're talking about an Akeshdi Rivener, which is an Akeshdi who never finds a mate.

**[01:37:50 - 01:38:05]** They just stay in the voraciously eating, mindlessly violent stage, rampaging throughout Akaton until they are generally hunted down by the rest of the Keshti society.

**[01:38:06 - 01:38:10]** Because they're considered a scourge on the Keshtis at large.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:38:11 - 01:38:12]** Thank you, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:38:13 - 01:38:14]** That was a perfect summary.

**[01:38:14 - 01:38:15]** Well said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:38:16 - 01:38:17]** I do want to point that out, though.

**[01:38:17 - 01:38:19]** The Riveners...

**[01:38:19 - 01:38:20]** Riveners are beyond help.

**[01:38:21 - 01:38:25]** They are past that point of no return.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:38:25 - 01:38:28]** Normally, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:38:28 - 01:38:36]** Yeah, so when this creature came out, you first heard them talking, saying, no, no, no, no, you can't make me.

**[01:38:37 - 01:38:38]** I won't go back in there.

**[01:38:39 - 01:38:40]** And then this Rivener comes out.

**[01:38:41 - 01:38:46]** And if you encountered a Rivener anywhere else, it probably would not have said anything.

**[01:38:47 - 01:38:48]** Which is already weird.

**[01:38:48 - 01:38:50]** And then it attacks Rick19.

**[01:38:51 - 01:38:53]** And you guys took an interesting stance.

**[01:38:53 - 01:38:55]** You were like... Wait a minute.

**[01:38:56 - 01:38:58]** I don't know that I want to attack back.

**[01:38:58 - 01:39:01]** Because it seems like this creature... Maybe it was the Bolita.

**[01:39:02 - 01:39:05]** Maybe you're like... We couldn't actually help the Bolita.

**[01:39:06 - 01:39:07]** For whatever reason.

**[01:39:07 - 01:39:08]** We tried.


## Speaker_0

**[01:39:08 - 01:39:08]** But...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:39:09 - 01:39:10]** And now we want to help this creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:39:11 - 01:39:13]** I think it was... Well, we even did it with the Skrillings.

**[01:39:13 - 01:39:14]** We allowed to leave as well.

**[01:39:14 - 01:39:15]** That's true.

**[01:39:15 - 01:39:16]** Well, all of us but Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:39:16 - 01:39:18]** I think Hears was still like, no, I'm going to kill you.

**[01:39:18 - 01:39:20]** Yeah, and then failed melee roll after melee roll.

**[01:39:21 - 01:39:22]** Yeah.

**[01:39:22 - 01:39:25]** As they limped out and you just kept trying to stab them.

**[01:39:25 - 01:39:26]** That was funny.

**[01:39:26 - 01:39:26]** That was good.

**[01:39:27 - 01:39:27]** Yeah.

**[01:39:27 - 01:39:28]** It's not fun.

**[01:39:29 - 01:39:30]** But...

**[01:39:30 - 01:39:36]** This is true that we did end up wanting to help Frog, but I think we also just not wanted not to fight fucking Frog.

**[01:39:36 - 01:39:38]** Yeah, I think that was a big motivation.

**[01:39:38 - 01:39:39]** Frog did like 13 points of damage.

**[01:39:39 - 01:39:40]** That was a contributing factor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:39:41 - 01:39:42]** Yeah, definitely.

**[01:39:42 - 01:39:43]** It's a very, very large one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:39:45 - 01:39:46]** But yeah, you talked to Frog.

**[01:39:46 - 01:39:49]** You're able to calm Frog down.

**[01:39:49 - 01:40:13]** and tell and say like we're in a similar boat i don't know what happened to you but we also have experienced hardship prescribed in the ap that yes there are ways to you know do that to help out and try and talk to the creature no but like in in this ap does it say if they attempt to do this allow them to do that at these levels or whatever 15 rolls to the troll lair

**[01:40:14 - 01:40:21]** There is language around what happens if you speak with Frog and are able to diffuse the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:40:22 - 01:40:23]** But we can't diffuse every situation, right?

**[01:40:23 - 01:40:27]** The AP doesn't allow for a diffusing of certain situations, I'm guessing.

**[01:40:27 - 01:40:28]** Unless you roll...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:40:28 - 01:40:37]** you could roll really well, but it's one of those things where it's like, it's less about you're unable to, and it's more just that some people aren't going to change their mind.

**[01:40:38 - 01:40:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:40:38 - 01:40:40]** And it doesn't make sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:40:41 - 01:40:46]** So I'm, I'm prepping to, to run the next, you know, story.

**[01:40:46 - 01:40:51]** Um, and I can tell you from Mark, from my book that John won't tell you cause he's secretive and I'm not as secretive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:40:52 - 01:40:53]** Um, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:40:53 - 01:40:56]** Like each, each character you run into has a development block.

**[01:40:56 - 01:40:56]** Yeah.

**[01:40:56 - 01:41:14]** after it that basically has triggers and and like if this happens you know it's if statements you understand if statements but um no so yeah explain it to me no it's true also and yes please and if statements and object and then some switch statements

**[01:41:14 - 01:41:16]** I wouldn't say they're object oriented.

**[01:41:16 - 01:41:17]** I still don't understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:41:17 - 01:41:32]** It's just the logic that is present at a very first principles level for many things that if you're just trying to say, if you want some action to occur by some sort of trigger, then you say, well, if this trigger occurs, then these other actions will occur.

**[01:41:33 - 01:41:34]** Yeah.

**[01:41:34 - 01:42:01]** otherwise or else this should happen instead or you can have an else if there are lots of other things but the whole development block which is true uh and all that i'm not doing is going into the full like context of the block but the but the blocks paizo does a really good job of writing and giving you context to say like if the characters want to do this here is this creature or npcs or monsters motivation here's how they would typically respond


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:42:01 - 01:42:04]** Yeah, and sometimes it just says they fight to the death no matter what.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:42:04 - 01:42:05]** Because they are, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:42:06 - 01:42:09]** Those are the ones that you will not be able to talk down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:42:09 - 01:42:17]** And usually when you look at that creature's intelligence or their charisma or what their motivations are, you're like, that makes sense.

**[01:42:18 - 01:42:19]** It's going to fight to the death.

**[01:42:20 - 01:42:21]** So could we have tamed the laser dogs?

**[01:42:23 - 01:42:25]** They didn't have a high intelligence ability.

**[01:42:26 - 01:42:27]** Your fear did an effect.

**[01:42:28 - 01:42:36]** I think if you really wanted to, you could have like maybe under the circumstances of like a really like a crit hit and then one of them goes down and the other one's like, you know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:42:36 - 01:42:40]** I'm out, you know, and just roll some ball bearings down the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:42:40 - 01:42:42]** There's also usually language for like if...

**[01:42:42 - 01:42:59]** if like the leader or if more than this many die the others will tend to flee right there's there's there's like this encouragement there for you to explore different methods of combat because not every combat should just be hey here are some monsters they're gonna fight to the death see you later it's like it needs to be interesting right

**[01:43:00 - 01:43:03]** Anyway, so that's what happens with Frog.

**[01:43:03 - 01:43:15]** You befriend this Akeshi named Frog, who is a former gladiator on a popular Athertonian gladiator show in the arena.

**[01:43:16 - 01:43:22]** And you remember them getting into some sort of trouble, and then they were no longer on the show, and then now they're here.

**[01:43:22 - 01:43:29]** But again, the weird thing is that Frog is like, I am not a Rivener, but I am physically a Rivener.

**[01:43:29 - 01:43:30]** And also Frog's talking to you.

**[01:43:31 - 01:43:33]** Doctor, okay, I think you do some sort of test.

**[01:43:33 - 01:43:47]** You realize that clearly the greys have been manipulating Frog's basic DNA, basic biological principles to change Frog, which is weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:43:48 - 01:43:56]** And you're like... Accelerated him into Rivner State, but kept his mental capacity... At whatever... Tenuous at best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:43:56 - 01:43:56]** Right.

**[01:43:57 - 01:43:59]** His mental capacity was mostly there.

**[01:43:59 - 01:44:01]** He was under a lot of stress and anxiety.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:44:01 - 01:44:01]** Yeah.

**[01:44:01 - 01:44:03]** I mean, he's certainly more advanced than any other Rufiner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:44:04 - 01:44:05]** Yeah, exactly.

**[01:44:06 - 01:44:09]** And you were like, hey, can you help us fight this troll who Frog has already fought?

**[01:44:09 - 01:44:11]** And Frog was like, I do not want to fight this thing again.

**[01:44:12 - 01:44:14]** And you appealed to his...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:44:14 - 01:44:39]** his his his best self which is like you are a gladiator this is what you do you fight and we were like we're we're in it with you right like yeah just it's not just you out there exactly it's you have friends which is no matter your situation now uh or what it was before it is now here and you are compelled to uh to act


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:44:39 - 01:44:40]** Yeah, which is great.

**[01:44:40 - 01:44:45]** And Frog's like, I'll do it, but you have to help me free this creature which is in this other room.

**[01:44:45 - 01:44:47]** Free this creature from life?

**[01:44:47 - 01:44:50]** Yeah, from life.

**[01:44:50 - 01:44:55]** They're too far gone, but I know what it's like to go through this and you need to help me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:44:55 - 01:44:57]** It's a sheer and riven gap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:44:57 - 01:45:06]** To illustrate it for Frog, he had suffered two of the biggest shames right in succession.

**[01:45:06 - 01:45:08]** He wakes up and suddenly he's a rivener.

**[01:45:08 - 01:45:15]** He's this scourge of a Keshti society that is actively hunted by every other Keshti.

**[01:45:15 - 01:45:44]** and he just lost he just failed at what he's spent his whole life excelling at so like both of those in quick succession he's like no I would just rather clock out yeah it's a good it's a good analysis I think you that is one of my favorite parts of book two is how you guys befriended met kind of brought into the fold into the party his company was really good too


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:45:44 - 01:45:45]** Oh, hey, thanks.

**[01:45:46 - 01:45:50]** You know, it was meant to be Australian, but it's tough with those low registers.

**[01:45:51 - 01:45:52]** This is really tough.

**[01:45:52 - 01:45:55]** If you're a low register Australian, please write in.

**[01:45:55 - 01:45:58]** Let us know if anybody thinks that you're... Send us audio.

**[01:45:58 - 01:46:03]** Yeah, just send us audio and then I'll practice it and then it'll be better.

**[01:46:03 - 01:46:08]** So you fight this swarm creature and it brands frog.

**[01:46:08 - 01:46:11]** Pretty easy fight, I think, with frog at your side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:46:11 - 01:46:19]** I think my favorite part about that fight was here's inspired my artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:46:20 - 01:46:21]** That was amazing.

**[01:46:21 - 01:46:22]** That was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:46:23 - 01:46:24]** It's a beautiful moment.

**[01:46:24 - 01:46:28]** We do love to have affectionate moments with inanimate objects in this game.

**[01:46:29 - 01:46:30]** It's good.

**[01:46:30 - 01:46:32]** It's a theme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:46:33 - 01:46:34]** It's a theme.

**[01:46:34 - 01:46:50]** While you're in there, you also discover that there's this... After you help free this creature from life, you find that there's this piece of metal that looks like it belonged to some larger device or something.

**[01:46:51 - 01:46:53]** And one...

**[01:46:53 - 01:46:56]** As you near it, here's his artifact.

**[01:46:57 - 01:46:57]** It's blue.

**[01:46:57 - 01:46:59]** It starts to shine a little bit.

**[01:46:59 - 01:47:00]** It's weird.

**[01:47:00 - 01:47:05]** And the writing on it in Aklo is the name Nakrall.

**[01:47:06 - 01:47:07]** The word Nakrall on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:47:08 - 01:47:08]** I tried to Google it.

**[01:47:08 - 01:47:09]** I couldn't find anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:47:09 - 01:47:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:47:10 - 01:47:15]** But I didn't Google Nakrall Starfinder because that definitely would take me to something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:47:15 - 01:47:19]** But I think what you remember from it is this mega mind thing.

**[01:47:19 - 01:47:36]** idea that some you know races have this like mega mind sense so it's a little bit obscure not quite sure yet maybe now you have a chance to look it up then you open the door you're like let's let's wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:47:37 - 01:47:39]** here's your stone.

**[01:47:40 - 01:47:45]** You have a stone or artifact or something that Rolu gave you that we're not all aware of, right?

**[01:47:45 - 01:47:46]** Or have you showed us this?

**[01:47:47 - 01:47:48]** Yeah, he's seen it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:47:48 - 01:47:53]** I think you've seen it, but I don't think you know all the details about it yet.

**[01:47:53 - 01:47:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:47:53 - 01:47:58]** Okay, so, but Rick's not completely aware, but, like, Kevin wants to know more.

**[01:47:59 - 01:48:03]** The stone has now interacted with two things or three things?

**[01:48:03 - 01:48:04]** I think it's two things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:48:05 - 01:48:07]** There was... The relic?

**[01:48:07 - 01:48:09]** Yeah, the relic in that... From the Chimera?

**[01:48:09 - 01:48:11]** From the, quote, other cargo bay.

**[01:48:12 - 01:48:15]** And then from book two, this thing.

**[01:48:15 - 01:48:16]** Rude.

**[01:48:17 - 01:48:47]** the hidden cargo bay yeah the one that didn't exist but did and then like the uh starburst yeah plumber episode one i still think it's a good merch idea by the way like to get like the other cargo bay it's like a merch thing the other it's like a shirt yeah but just two things so far but hopefully more things because that that's a something here's that's a guide for years you need to know yeah love it gave his life for that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:48:47 - 01:49:00]** to give me that Vinnie I kind of want to know your insights on on here's the stones as a listener I'm I'm intrigued by the glowing stone it

**[01:49:01 - 01:49:12]** Strangely enough, like, the parallel that I draw is, like, an elven blade, how it glows around trolls or goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:49:12 - 01:49:13]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:49:13 - 01:49:16]** So, like, is it glowing around a particular element?

**[01:49:17 - 01:49:19]** Is it glowing around like materials?

**[01:49:19 - 01:49:21]** Like, what's the...

**[01:49:21 - 01:49:46]** what's the crux i don't know i think it's interesting the um i think the last thing it glowed around or the first thing was the the sheet of metal inside the artifact was that right that was it was like the reset button or um you know card is like please reinsert before restarting which felt like a huge red herring and like to me was like okay sure

**[01:49:46 - 01:50:07]** this is this is this stone may not be as important as we think it is but the second time it glows like okay maybe it is and again nothing in this story is as it seems well now i'm curious kelly do you have any insight into what is happening with that stone or are you just as blind as the rest of us and that's just the answer


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:50:08 - 01:50:10]** I have a little more insight, yeah.

**[01:50:10 - 01:50:11]** But I'll just say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:50:12 - 01:50:13]** That's fine.

**[01:50:13 - 01:50:16]** John also has this really great grin on his face where he's like, I know.

**[01:50:16 - 01:50:18]** I know the answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:50:19 - 01:50:20]** John wrote this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:50:20 - 01:50:22]** John knows everything.

**[01:50:22 - 01:50:24]** He just likes to see us squirm.

**[01:50:24 - 01:50:25]** Yeah.

**[01:50:25 - 01:50:25]** I know.

**[01:50:25 - 01:50:26]** Classic.

**[01:50:26 - 01:50:26]** Yeah.

**[01:50:27 - 01:50:29]** That's, that's a fun part about being a GM.

**[01:50:29 - 01:50:32]** When you have these like mystery things, you get to see people work through it.

**[01:50:32 - 01:50:40]** Anyway, all great conversation that maybe will be revealed in time.

**[01:50:40 - 01:50:41]** So you open the door.

**[01:50:41 - 01:50:44]** Back in this room, you're like, open the door.

**[01:50:44 - 01:50:46]** You're in greenery.

**[01:50:46 - 01:50:48]** You're in this greenhouse area.

**[01:50:48 - 01:50:53]** And Hears is immediately fascinated with these beautiful blooms.

**[01:50:54 - 01:50:54]** What do you call them?

**[01:50:55 - 01:50:56]** Versace?

**[01:50:56 - 01:50:57]** Yeah.

**[01:50:57 - 01:50:57]** That's what they're called.

**[01:50:57 - 01:50:58]** Versace.

**[01:50:58 - 01:51:00]** Yeah, they're the Versace blooms.

**[01:51:00 - 01:51:04]** The summer 2022 collection.

**[01:51:04 - 01:51:06]** Here's is a sucker for fashion.

**[01:51:06 - 01:51:09]** Here's has good taste.

**[01:51:10 - 01:51:12]** And you go up to investigate this new collection.

**[01:51:13 - 01:51:15]** He does love himself an inanimate object.

**[01:51:15 - 01:51:17]** But you're like fascinated.

**[01:51:17 - 01:51:24]** And what I love was that I think when you all realized it, Kev, we went into initiative and Kev, you were like, can I roll something to like try and stop him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:51:24 - 01:51:27]** Well, because he passed me and I was like, he's entering my space.

**[01:51:27 - 01:51:29]** I get to use my attack of opportunity.

**[01:51:29 - 01:51:35]** But I failed because I should not have been able to do that attack of opportunity since it was the first round of initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:51:36 - 01:51:38]** But also it was just kind of cool.

**[01:51:38 - 01:51:39]** So it doesn't matter.

**[01:51:39 - 01:51:39]** Yeah.

**[01:51:39 - 01:51:43]** But it was just a cool image of you being like, ah, and he's like charging past you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:51:43 - 01:51:50]** Well, it's just funny because it's one of those things where the dice tell the story just as much as the story itself.

**[01:51:50 - 01:51:52]** And Rick rolled a lower initiative.

**[01:51:52 - 01:51:53]** I rolled.

**[01:51:53 - 01:51:56]** We rolled our dice and my dice roll was lower.

**[01:51:57 - 01:52:00]** So Kelly moved first.

**[01:52:00 - 01:52:06]** And if I had a higher initiative, I would have just hit the door and stopped him and it would have been a whole different story.

**[01:52:06 - 01:52:09]** But but the fact that he moved first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:52:09 - 01:52:14]** Yeah, well, it led to the fact that you guys then go out there, you pass these saves to not be fascinated.

**[01:52:15 - 01:52:19]** And once you kind of overcome it, you put on the your environmental protections on your suit.

**[01:52:19 - 01:52:28]** That's when you're you're trying to pull Kelly or pull here's out of the bush and you stumble on something in the bush.

**[01:52:29 - 01:52:33]** You look down and you see somebody.

**[01:52:33 - 01:52:34]** Who is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:52:37 - 01:52:41]** That was a really fun reveal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:52:41 - 01:52:42]** It was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:52:42 - 01:52:43]** It was.

**[01:52:43 - 01:52:44]** It was so much fun.

**[01:52:44 - 01:52:45]** Yeah, it was.

**[01:52:46 - 01:52:47]** I'll give a little insight to the listener.

**[01:52:47 - 01:52:49]** We all knew Vinny was coming in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:52:51 - 01:53:17]** but yeah we didn't know when and where but he was definitely like on the call before we started recording and it's not like he just appeared on our zoom but it but it was pretty great because it really was like venny wasn't even on the zoom call and then i was like you see off too right exactly he had his video off and then just out of nowhere when i was like you see you know like i said venny what do you see and then his face pops up and he just has this huge grin he's like yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:53:17 - 01:53:21]** It was one of those things that we might not have hit a point where Vinny could have come in.

**[01:53:21 - 01:53:25]** So even though he was on the call with us, he might not have been introduced to the episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:53:25 - 01:53:29]** It gets even funnier because you guys recorded two episodes that day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:53:30 - 01:53:30]** Yeah.

**[01:53:31 - 01:53:32]** And you took a while to get through the fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:53:33 - 01:53:34]** Yeah.

**[01:53:34 - 01:53:37]** So hang out for an hour and a half and then...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:53:39 - 01:53:40]** See if we make it through.

**[01:53:41 - 01:53:47]** What I love in editing the episode right before you come in is that I have all of your laughs from when we were all laughing.

**[01:53:47 - 01:53:49]** But you were muted, so we didn't hear you at all.

**[01:53:49 - 01:53:51]** But I can hear you being like, ha!

**[01:53:51 - 01:53:51]** This is great.

**[01:53:53 - 01:53:55]** So that's the introduction of Colin Edenbrand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:53:57 - 01:53:58]** We're so glad to have you.

**[01:53:59 - 01:54:00]** I have a question for Colin.

**[01:54:02 - 01:54:05]** You clearly built your character to be a healer.

**[01:54:05 - 01:54:13]** Um, I never tried to be like, I played a cleric in D and D, but like star finders known to not actually have like a healer class is met mystic.

**[01:54:14 - 01:54:16]** The best, uh, like healer class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:54:16 - 01:54:17]** So, I think so.

**[01:54:19 - 01:54:28]** And it was a calculated decision for me because I'm not familiar with the Starfinder system at all.

**[01:54:28 - 01:54:32]** This is quite literally the first Starfinder game I've ever played.

**[01:54:32 - 01:54:38]** So, I've really enjoyed playing a Cleric in another TTRPG 5e.

**[01:54:39 - 01:54:41]** And...

**[01:54:41 - 01:54:44]** Like, I'm told that I play it well.

**[01:54:45 - 01:54:46]** And so I was like, all right, let's do what I know.

**[01:54:46 - 01:54:48]** I can play a healer.

**[01:54:48 - 01:54:51]** And what does that look like in Starfinder?

**[01:54:52 - 01:54:53]** And I don't know, man.

**[01:54:53 - 01:54:53]** You do it well.

**[01:54:54 - 01:54:57]** As we talk about the next couple of episodes, I think I'm doing all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:54:57 - 01:55:25]** yeah yeah so you uh let's just just just to get to it you know i mean you introduce yourself to frog and the party you all are able to kind of blindfold frog and safely get through the rest of these blooms as you realize they are still you know active uh you're you're going to where you know is the the final shaft down into the final fight with this troll you along the way you discover another dead gray you think maybe they were like

**[01:55:25 - 01:55:55]** harvesting these blooms to use seems like there were you know you found some I think grenades and some poison that seemed like there were some you know harvested for this and it's when you get into the final shaft as you're about to go down that that's when you find here's and I think it was Colin you both have this sense in your head and Rick 19 is you start to go down the ladder that there is a warning there's an alarm but it's a telepathic alarm which


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:55:54 - 01:56:18]** warning you which is actually kind of cool yeah it's a pretty neat idea very interesting idea that the greys have this telepathic alarm system going on that only they would know um before we go any further though this is when you had another flashback in opsec terms that's pretty awesome yeah we actually skipped a flashback that's okay we did which was the other flash we skipped the flashback where


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:56:19 - 01:56:21]** Do you want to just get them all at the same time?

**[01:56:21 - 01:56:23]** The ship's getting darker and darker.

**[01:56:24 - 01:56:29]** That's the one that came in this episode before then was there.

**[01:56:30 - 01:56:35]** The first one, you know, was where this young Sheeran is meeting with this gray.

**[01:56:35 - 01:56:42]** And then the next one is like presumably the next morning in the dining hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:56:42 - 01:56:42]** That's right.

**[01:56:42 - 01:56:44]** The boys, the boys are missing for a day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:56:44 - 01:56:53]** So now there's a focus on Marcus with his two boys and they're at the table and they're talking and there's news updates.

**[01:56:53 - 01:56:59]** There's a sense of tension in the room and it's at the end of that that the door opens and the young Sheeran boy is back.

**[01:57:02 - 01:57:05]** They couldn't find him on the entire ship and then now he's back.

**[01:57:05 - 01:57:07]** And then that's where we ended that one.

**[01:57:07 - 01:57:12]** And we pick up in this last one with the boy's mother, Zenka.

**[01:57:12 - 01:57:15]** We know this name is her name.

**[01:57:16 - 01:57:24]** She is escorting him, pulling him away, trying to pull away from all these cameras that are happening and security and this whole hubbub.

**[01:57:24 - 01:57:27]** And it's during this time that...

**[01:57:27 - 01:57:29]** this event happens.

**[01:57:29 - 01:57:30]** All the lights go off.

**[01:57:30 - 01:57:37]** Suddenly the boy is alone walking down the hall where he sees these shadows turns down the hall and it's Marcus.

**[01:57:38 - 01:57:47]** It's, it's a bunch of passengers and, and, and crew on the ship floating with their heads back, their arms dangling down, their mouths open, their eyes open.

**[01:57:47 - 01:57:53]** And he sees another, you know, gray in the hallways lurking in the shadows.

**[01:57:53 - 01:57:54]** When Zanka walks,

**[01:57:54 - 01:58:20]** pulls his arm they start running through the ship and it seems like as they're running there they're seeing more of these bodies but lights are going out and they're just barely able to get onto an escape pod and get outside of the sugesta where they watch as the ship goes dark and then suddenly they see little flashes of light coalesce into one big flash of light and we white out and that was that flashback

**[01:58:20 - 01:58:21]** Crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:58:21 - 01:58:22]** Yeah.

**[01:58:22 - 01:58:23]** That was the best.

**[01:58:24 - 01:58:25]** I'm just saying it was such a creepy flashback.

**[01:58:25 - 01:58:26]** That was my favorite one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:58:26 - 01:58:28]** Yeah, it was definitely really creepy writing it.

**[01:58:28 - 01:58:31]** I mean, if I was getting creeped out writing it, I thought this must be creepy.

**[01:58:32 - 01:58:38]** And so you basically go and you have a mind meld between Heroes and Colin, which is a really nice moment.

**[01:58:38 - 01:58:40]** And then everyone is talking.

**[01:58:40 - 01:58:43]** Frog shares a little bit about how he acts before a fight.

**[01:58:43 - 01:58:48]** It felt like a collective, you know, all right, we're really about to do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:58:48 - 01:58:53]** That comedic relief in Frog's pep talk was spectacular.

**[01:58:53 - 01:58:57]** Yeah, because he basically just says all the newcomer's shit themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:59:00 - 01:59:01]** It's okay.

**[01:59:01 - 01:59:07]** But, you know, just to jump back, I really like the mind meld because obviously, Benny, you know about the previous episode's content, but Colin doesn't.

**[01:59:07 - 01:59:10]** So you and here is really connected in that.

**[01:59:10 - 01:59:13]** And I think in general, everyone really shared in that scene in those moments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:59:13 - 01:59:22]** And for the listener, it was a really interesting experience for me because we are, I don't know how far, I'll just pull the curtain back.

**[01:59:22 - 01:59:24]** We're like recording four or five episodes ahead.

**[01:59:25 - 01:59:29]** So I, as a fan, am listening to the podcast as it's released.

**[01:59:29 - 01:59:31]** But there was a gap of like five episodes.

**[01:59:31 - 01:59:33]** I had no idea what happened.

**[01:59:33 - 01:59:45]** because i wasn't participant in them and they haven't been published for me to listen to so like colin's amnesia and uh lack of awareness of what actually happened was reflected in my lack of awareness for what happened so like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:59:46 - 01:59:48]** And a couple things came up again, like the tunnel.

**[01:59:49 - 01:59:50]** Yeah, that's right.

**[01:59:50 - 01:59:52]** Vinny was like, I don't understand what's going on here.

**[01:59:53 - 01:59:55]** But it's like, oh yeah, you weren't a part of that episode yet.

**[01:59:55 - 01:59:56]** You weren't involved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:59:57 - 01:59:58]** Well, so let's just cut right to it.

**[01:59:58 - 02:00:04]** I mean, you go down the shaft and you are just immediately thrown into a giant fight.

**[02:00:05 - 02:00:10]** With a two-headed troll that seems to have this crazy ability to... Cheat.

**[02:00:10 - 02:00:11]** Move.

**[02:00:11 - 02:00:12]** Teleport.

**[02:00:12 - 02:00:13]** Cheat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:00:14 - 02:00:16]** Teleport and reach 10 feet.

**[02:00:17 - 02:00:19]** To attack the stat block.

**[02:00:19 - 02:00:20]** You know that this happens.

**[02:00:20 - 02:00:22]** Was it really 30 feet?

**[02:00:22 - 02:00:23]** Yeah.

**[02:00:23 - 02:00:23]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:00:23 - 02:00:25]** I can say yes.

**[02:00:25 - 02:00:26]** There's pretty much anywhere in the room.

**[02:00:27 - 02:00:31]** And that ability to move.

**[02:00:32 - 02:00:38]** And in the development motive block, it says if the troll can move, the troll will move.

**[02:00:38 - 02:00:40]** So unless...

**[02:00:40 - 02:00:42]** There's a big pull, which there was a big pull.

**[02:00:42 - 02:00:45]** It was Frog, because the troll had fought Frog before.

**[02:00:45 - 02:00:50]** But in general, you can expect that the troll is going to use that ability to teleport in this quantum state.

**[02:00:51 - 02:00:55]** Because I think it was Hears who looked at the troll's blood and saw the quantum superposition.

**[02:00:55 - 02:00:57]** We saw it on the ladder, too, didn't we?

**[02:00:57 - 02:00:58]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:00:58 - 02:01:02]** You said the blood was glitching, and I was like, blood can't glitch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[02:01:02 - 02:01:07]** Well, that's what it does when it's not from our dimension, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:01:07 - 02:01:08]** Duh.

**[02:01:08 - 02:01:09]** That's true.

**[02:01:09 - 02:01:26]** And then what's also interesting is that you realize that the way to shut down this reactor is that you need a type of multi-factor access where one person has to be telepathically linked to this gray device, and the other person has to be physically analog connected to the computer.

**[02:01:27 - 02:01:28]** And you had options there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:01:28 - 02:01:33]** You had options like once... So what if a group didn't have somebody who was telepathic?

**[02:01:33 - 02:01:35]** There's still an option to shut it down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:01:35 - 02:01:40]** Yeah, so if you recall at the end of that fight, I told you how there was a trap on that computer.

**[02:01:40 - 02:01:46]** If you try to access that computer without trying to connect telepathically at all...

**[02:01:46 - 02:01:47]** then you would have set off the trap.

**[02:01:47 - 02:01:50]** And if you don't have telepathy, then the DC would have been much higher.

**[02:01:50 - 02:01:56]** But it's more about how if you try to hack it, those lasers will come down to target whoever's trying to hack it.

**[02:01:56 - 02:01:59]** And really, it's just another complication in this whole scenario.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[02:01:59 - 02:02:01]** I don't think we could have survived that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:02:01 - 02:02:01]** Right.

**[02:02:01 - 02:02:04]** Dude, that is a true boss fight.

**[02:02:04 - 02:02:10]** Anybody who's running this or is thinking about running it, that hit me up because that is a true boss fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:02:10 - 02:02:19]** And add on to the fact that we had Hrog with us who drew a lot of the aggro and got that troll's attention and took a lot of the damage from the fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:02:19 - 02:02:21]** Yeah, and then paid the price.

**[02:02:21 - 02:02:28]** I would be curious to see what percentage of the troll's hit points Hrog did single-handedly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:02:28 - 02:02:29]** Because he critted him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:02:29 - 02:02:30]** Yeah, he did a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[02:02:31 - 02:02:34]** I think he crit him and still...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:02:35 - 02:02:37]** And then that spawned a troll polyp.

**[02:02:37 - 02:02:38]** That's right, yeah.

**[02:02:38 - 02:02:39]** Because he crit him and cut off part of the troll.

**[02:02:40 - 02:02:41]** That's part of the troll's development.

**[02:02:41 - 02:02:42]** The troll is being optimized.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[02:02:42 - 02:02:45]** It's like halfway through its damage stat block or whatever.

**[02:02:45 - 02:02:48]** It morphs into multiple enemies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:02:49 - 02:02:52]** Yeah, so the polyp comes in with the amount of damage done on the crit.

**[02:02:52 - 02:02:54]** So I think it was, you know, Hrog did 39 puts of damage.

**[02:02:55 - 02:02:55]** So it did 39.

**[02:02:55 - 02:02:58]** It had 39 HP because it's a badass creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:02:58 - 02:03:01]** Which is the polyp that you saw earlier.

**[02:03:01 - 02:03:04]** The polyp that we came in the very beginning of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[02:03:04 - 02:03:06]** Exactly.

**[02:03:06 - 02:03:07]** Oh, okay.

**[02:03:07 - 02:03:08]** Oh, man.

**[02:03:09 - 02:03:09]** Connections.

**[02:03:10 - 02:03:10]** Yep.

**[02:03:10 - 02:03:17]** So wait, if we had hit the troll with like a 10 point, then the polyp would have had 10 points?

**[02:03:17 - 02:03:17]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:03:18 - 02:03:38]** interesting it's a cool mechanic that owen casey stevens the writer of the second book came up with and you know and the whole starfighter team that they came up with so we made the polyp tougher by allowing frog to hit him oh interesting yeah that's why that thing was so hard to hit

**[02:03:39 - 02:03:39]** Thanks, Rod.

**[02:03:39 - 02:03:43]** Well, the troll polyp naturally had a high AC, and so did the troll, right?

**[02:03:43 - 02:03:52]** But fighting the troll polyp in the first half of the book, it sets up this idea that there's going to be different types of damage, right?

**[02:03:52 - 02:04:00]** That you're going to have to overcome these regenerative properties that the troll's blood has, the creature's half.

**[02:04:00 - 02:04:02]** That's when you're introduced to this mechanic.

**[02:04:02 - 02:04:03]** Also...

**[02:04:04 - 02:04:11]** Note that at this point, Dr. O'Kane hears do successfully shut down the reactor from overloading, but you had a choice.

**[02:04:11 - 02:04:12]** You had a choice.

**[02:04:12 - 02:04:20]** You could turn it off or you could turn it off and then have it come back online to then explode soon thereafter at a different time.

**[02:04:20 - 02:04:21]** I chose to turn it off.

**[02:04:22 - 02:04:23]** You just chose to turn it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[02:04:24 - 02:04:30]** The idea I had was that if this troll is feeding off of the radiation, then, uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:04:31 - 02:04:34]** Not having it on would benefit us.

**[02:04:35 - 02:04:36]** And you were right.

**[02:04:36 - 02:04:37]** The troll was like, get out.

**[02:04:37 - 02:04:39]** You know, the troll's at the door to the reactor trying to get in.

**[02:04:40 - 02:04:45]** If you remember when Frog was fighting it, it was at the time that the troll got closer physically to where the lateral was.

**[02:04:46 - 02:04:47]** The troll left Frog.

**[02:04:47 - 02:04:49]** The troll said, hey, there's some radiation nearby.

**[02:04:51 - 02:04:52]** I want to get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:04:52 - 02:04:56]** So I had this thought today, actually.

**[02:04:56 - 02:05:01]** Like, what if we had opened the doors and let the troll into...

**[02:05:02 - 02:05:20]** you could have done that like is that a satisfactory resolution just like let him in hit the self-destruct and dip at the end of the day you wanted to leave the troll wants radiation and you had the means you could have opened the door but it wanted you could have done that too


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:05:21 - 02:05:47]** and non-fathers we could have talked it down and made it a friend we could have befriended everybody yeah I think we joked about that just the troll saying like hey guys I need help can you get the door it would be great if you could help out the troll's intelligence as a product of its upbringing you know it's not even with two brains it was still dumb yeah yeah two empty cavities where a brain should be

**[02:05:47 - 02:05:53]** So Frog ultimately pays the price, but he dies doing what he loves with his friends.

**[02:05:54 - 02:05:55]** Which is exactly what you told him.

**[02:05:55 - 02:05:56]** That you were going to be there for him.

**[02:05:57 - 02:05:57]** And you were.

**[02:05:58 - 02:06:00]** But unfortunately, Frog dies.

**[02:06:00 - 02:06:01]** That was a hard hit.

**[02:06:01 - 02:06:04]** You managed to finish the fight and then even fighting the Trollpollop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:06:05 - 02:06:10]** The troll regenerates because it starts to come back up and they still kill it again.

**[02:06:10 - 02:06:11]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:06:11 - 02:06:12]** I don't want to gloss over that.

**[02:06:12 - 02:06:13]** That death hurt.

**[02:06:15 - 02:06:25]** Frog being broken by the troll was like equal parts disbelief and fear.

**[02:06:25 - 02:06:51]** right also like sort of a reinvigorating okay this is not we are not going to accept this as an outcome he will i i was i was saddened by that like it yeah the troll effectively created the avengers yeah yeah it was the hulk he was yeah yeah that's true it's a good point man frog the hardest death for sure for me


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:06:51 - 02:07:07]** by fr so then you're like great we just took out a troll polyp we took out a troll even after it came back to life which shut down the reactor yeah yeah as we know from kevin's navy experience that's how you shut down a reactor accurate kill the troll

**[02:07:08 - 02:07:09]** Yep.

**[02:07:09 - 02:07:10]** Kill the troll.

**[02:07:11 - 02:07:15]** And then you reach out to the one and only Shay.

**[02:07:16 - 02:07:17]** And Shay says, great.

**[02:07:17 - 02:07:19]** We got our reactor set up.

**[02:07:19 - 02:07:20]** And says, hey, cool.

**[02:07:20 - 02:07:21]** Come on up.

**[02:07:21 - 02:07:22]** Let's meet each other.

**[02:07:22 - 02:07:24]** And you guys said, hang on.

**[02:07:25 - 02:07:26]** We're still paranoid.

**[02:07:26 - 02:07:26]** Mm-hmm.

**[02:07:27 - 02:07:29]** And you're saying, I don't think we're going to do that.

**[02:07:29 - 02:07:34]** So as you're coming back up, you say, you know what, maybe we go through the shaft, go to the other side.

**[02:07:34 - 02:07:38]** And you say, better yet, let's tell them that we'll meet them, but then go to the other side.

**[02:07:39 - 02:07:41]** And then you pull an Uno reverse card, you flip flop.

**[02:07:42 - 02:07:46]** Because then you radio them and you say, hold on, we're going to tell them we're going to the other side.

**[02:07:47 - 02:07:51]** So you trigger the motion sensors and then you actually go back to where you were originally supposed to meet them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:07:52 - 02:07:56]** And again, I'm going to ask this, and you're probably not going to answer, but we could have gone that way.

**[02:07:56 - 02:07:57]** Yeah.

**[02:07:57 - 02:08:02]** And if we would have gone that way, would there be an equal amount of rooms and spaces?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:08:03 - 02:08:15]** That was the understanding that they gave to you, was that the area that you were in, again, overall, this whole station is huge, but the two areas where the reactors were pretty similar.

**[02:08:15 - 02:08:18]** So you would have had a very similar map, right?

**[02:08:18 - 02:08:42]** to the one that you're in but there are still creatures in there that we would have ended up you would have flipped horizontally the maybe maybe there's another college still paralyzed we don't know i mean it's not totally equal but remember that shade did say you know hey we got out of there by the skin of our teeth right we already lost people uh so we didn't fight everyone there also

**[02:08:43 - 02:08:45]** Were those creatures detailed?

**[02:08:46 - 02:08:51]** I will pull back the curtain and say that I came up with everything that's on the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:08:53 - 02:08:54]** Oh, wow.

**[02:08:54 - 02:08:55]** So what does the book say?

**[02:08:55 - 02:09:00]** The book says if they go that way, does that tunnel even exist in the book?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:09:00 - 02:09:01]** Yeah, it does.

**[02:09:01 - 02:09:01]** It does.

**[02:09:01 - 02:09:04]** You know, overall, the book outlines what happens a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[02:09:04 - 02:09:06]** And I thought, well, like a description.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:09:06 - 02:09:08]** And I knew that you guys wanted to do that.

**[02:09:08 - 02:09:10]** You know, I'm going to make it worth your while.

**[02:09:10 - 02:09:15]** I'm not going to say, sorry, this is not in the scope of the adventure, which is fine sometimes in the right situation.

**[02:09:15 - 02:09:20]** You know, I mean, I heard it in some other podcasts where they say, if you keep going in this direction.

**[02:09:20 - 02:09:23]** that will literally not be in the adventure whatsoever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:09:24 - 02:09:25]** Why are you laughing, Vinny?

**[02:09:28 - 02:09:29]** Has that happened to you?

**[02:09:29 - 02:09:30]** I kind of want to see.

**[02:09:31 - 02:09:32]** No, Vinny was laughing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:09:34 - 02:09:35]** Oh, yeah.

**[02:09:35 - 02:09:39]** I DM a D&D campaign for my nephews and my brother-in-law.

**[02:09:39 - 02:09:40]** And, oh, yeah.

**[02:09:40 - 02:09:41]** It has absolutely happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:09:43 - 02:09:43]** He was like, nope.

**[02:09:44 - 02:09:44]** Close the book.

**[02:09:44 - 02:09:45]** Sorry, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:09:45 - 02:09:46]** It's not on the map.

**[02:09:46 - 02:09:47]** I don't have it prepared.

**[02:09:48 - 02:09:49]** Please turn it around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:09:49 - 02:09:52]** Slash, even if I do have it prepared, like, you sure you want to do that?

**[02:09:52 - 02:09:53]** You know, I guess so.

**[02:09:53 - 02:09:54]** Okay.

**[02:09:54 - 02:09:55]** Anyway, you could have gone there.

**[02:09:55 - 02:09:56]** You decided not to.

**[02:09:56 - 02:09:56]** That's fine.

**[02:09:56 - 02:09:57]** Then you say, you know what?

**[02:09:58 - 02:10:00]** Let's go to where they said to meet up.

**[02:10:00 - 02:10:05]** You enter past the two rooms before the ones that said that they had the red marking on.

**[02:10:05 - 02:10:11]** You enter into a giant bay where they seemingly traffic a lot of goods and grav carts and items.

**[02:10:12 - 02:10:15]** You exit via the giant airlock doors.

**[02:10:16 - 02:10:19]** There's a stable atmosphere on the other side.

**[02:10:19 - 02:10:20]** So you start heading up.

**[02:10:20 - 02:10:25]** You're not meeting any other company because they're off on the other side thinking that you're over there.

**[02:10:26 - 02:10:37]** And so when you continue into this massive hangar area where you see for the first time another starship that is not attached to hydraulics or in a large chamber showing images of space, right?

**[02:10:38 - 02:10:41]** Instead, you see a real starship and you see real space.

**[02:10:41 - 02:10:43]** In fact, you see an asteroid belt.

**[02:10:43 - 02:10:45]** And that's when Gnarly Yalamis comes out.

**[02:10:45 - 02:10:47]** She says, oh, I thought Shay was going to meet you.

**[02:10:48 - 02:10:49]** But I guess not.

**[02:10:49 - 02:10:50]** Welcome to the Voidcrier.

**[02:10:51 - 02:10:53]** It's a ship from the Steward's Fleet.

**[02:10:54 - 02:10:58]** But since the whole ship, including the Steward symbol, is grayed out, it's a special ops ship.

**[02:10:58 - 02:10:59]** Undercover.

**[02:10:59 - 02:11:00]** Designed for undercover.

**[02:11:00 - 02:11:01]** Designed for this team.

**[02:11:02 - 02:11:03]** So then Shay comes to meet you.

**[02:11:03 - 02:11:08]** I think it's around this time that, not to get too into the weeds, but, you know, we do explore somewhat...

**[02:11:08 - 02:11:10]** Y'all were kind of feeling each other out, right?

**[02:11:10 - 02:11:21]** Narla and Shay were talking and communicating openly, but there are also special ops agents who are grateful that they found you and that you're alive and that they're alive mutually, right?

**[02:11:21 - 02:11:23]** But they're thinking, how do we deal with this?

**[02:11:23 - 02:11:25]** And you all are thinking, are you for real?

**[02:11:26 - 02:11:27]** What is happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:11:27 - 02:11:33]** And here's a really good job of backstepping why we told Shay to go the other way.

**[02:11:33 - 02:11:35]** So thanks for covering that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[02:11:36 - 02:11:38]** Sure.

**[02:11:38 - 02:11:39]** I had some things planned, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:11:41 - 02:11:43]** Yeah, honestly, there was great role play there.

**[02:11:43 - 02:11:45]** I mean, we didn't even roll any checks, right?

**[02:11:45 - 02:11:47]** It all felt very natural.

**[02:11:47 - 02:11:50]** Didn't feel like there was a need to, you know, go down that road.

**[02:11:50 - 02:11:53]** Anyway, anyway, so then you trot on board.

**[02:11:53 - 02:11:57]** The Void Crier seems to be a nice stewardship.

**[02:11:57 - 02:11:58]** It's well designed.

**[02:11:58 - 02:12:00]** You're going up.

**[02:12:00 - 02:12:01]** You put that thing in reverse.

**[02:12:02 - 02:12:03]** Beep, beep, beep.

**[02:12:03 - 02:12:03]** Back it up.

**[02:12:04 - 02:12:04]** Back it out.

**[02:12:05 - 02:12:07]** And as you're burning rubber, peeling away...

**[02:12:07 - 02:12:14]** Then, first of all, Rick, you get a notification on your device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:12:14 - 02:12:18]** I did, and I write it off to the listeners without anybody else hearing.

**[02:12:19 - 02:12:23]** And I guess we're behind the curtains now a little bit.

**[02:12:23 - 02:12:29]** And yeah, if you guys want to know, it was basically like directions for my next mission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:12:29 - 02:12:30]** Okay, awesome.

**[02:12:31 - 02:12:32]** Okay, cool.

**[02:12:32 - 02:12:34]** So who do you work for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:12:34 - 02:12:35]** None of your business.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:12:36 - 02:12:39]** I was almost about to say just now.

**[02:12:39 - 02:12:42]** I don't know if I've revealed that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:12:42 - 02:12:43]** I think we have.

**[02:12:43 - 02:12:49]** If you go back and listen to episode one, it is revealed in episode one.

**[02:12:50 - 02:12:53]** Rick works for the abolitionist front.

**[02:12:53 - 02:12:55]** The android abolitionist front.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:12:55 - 02:12:56]** He got another target.

**[02:12:56 - 02:12:57]** He's going to kill someone again.

**[02:12:57 - 02:12:58]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:12:58 - 02:13:23]** murder some slaver that's not necessarily murder come on wait so you admit that your next thing is assassination murder i don't know what my next mission is i just know where i know where my next mission anyway so it's at that point that you're backing out i think uh doctor well no don't yeah everybody everybody gets okay okay so we're backing out and doctor okay you rightfully ask so are we just leaving this here

**[02:13:24 - 02:13:27]** You're just going to this place, right?

**[02:13:27 - 02:13:30]** You know, which, by the way, the stewards tell you a little bit more of what you know.

**[02:13:30 - 02:13:32]** They say this place is called Outpost Omicron.

**[02:13:33 - 02:13:39]** And then Shade just starts laughing and then says, hey, wait, Dr. OK, actually, I do have something for you.

**[02:13:40 - 02:13:46]** And sent you a little file pulled from some corrupt, wrecked data pad.

**[02:13:47 - 02:13:48]** And do you want to say what it is?

**[02:13:48 - 02:13:49]** Because you didn't reveal it.

**[02:13:49 - 02:13:50]** You didn't say what it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[02:13:50 - 02:13:51]** I did not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:13:51 - 02:13:51]** At all.

**[02:13:52 - 02:13:55]** You are welcome to here or you can keep it close to the vest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[02:13:55 - 02:14:18]** I mean, I will say that it involves Boushtakis and possibly, you know, some interesting development in, you know, his whereabouts or, you know, the fate of the Osharu world.

**[02:14:18 - 02:14:19]** Maybe it might be at stake.

**[02:14:19 - 02:14:21]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:14:21 - 02:14:22]** Pretty neato stuff.

**[02:14:23 - 02:14:23]** Yeah.

**[02:14:23 - 02:14:29]** And then from there, we cut over to Colin, who also gets a notification on his device.

**[02:14:30 - 02:14:31]** Do you want to say what it is or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:14:33 - 02:14:38]** I will say I will not say exactly what it is.

**[02:14:39 - 02:14:39]** Not here.

**[02:14:41 - 02:14:47]** It was a like I when I tell you my eyes about popped out of my head, my jaw dropped like it was.

**[02:14:47 - 02:14:56]** It was a core fundamental truth from Collins history that was not as he understood it to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:14:56 - 02:14:57]** Oh my God.

**[02:14:57 - 02:14:58]** Like you were told you were adopted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:14:58 - 02:15:08]** Um, and I will also say that, uh, any listeners who want to hit me up on discord, I am happy to share that with them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[02:15:09 - 02:15:09]** Dang.

**[02:15:09 - 02:15:11]** I'm going to make a fake account.

**[02:15:11 - 02:15:12]** And just so I could hit up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[02:15:14 - 02:15:20]** That's a great idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:15:20 - 02:15:23]** I don't remember.

**[02:15:23 - 02:15:24]** Cool.

**[02:15:24 - 02:15:28]** And then Kelly Hears also got a little message.

**[02:15:29 - 02:15:30]** It was an audio message.

**[02:15:30 - 02:15:31]** Do you want to say what that is?

**[02:15:31 - 02:15:31]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:15:31 - 02:15:33]** I cheated.

**[02:15:33 - 02:15:34]** I went back.

**[02:15:34 - 02:15:35]** Of course you did.

**[02:15:35 - 02:15:37]** This episode just came out last week and I listened to it.

**[02:15:37 - 02:15:38]** I listened to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:15:38 - 02:15:39]** It's devious.

**[02:15:39 - 02:16:07]** um i'm sorry um it's fine all right yeah so it's it's rolling why are you hold on why are you telling me why are you telling everyone because i'm curious no no no no no hold on let me say what happens to say it's my character he gets to decide if he wants to reveal it or not assassinating people's dreams too all right so wait i'm not allowed to listen back to that episode now yes you are because you can't it just came out last week you didn't listen this is what happens all right or if you want to keep the mystery what happens all right

**[02:16:07 - 02:16:11]** So, like, some audio.

**[02:16:11 - 02:16:13]** I think, yeah, I can't remember if it's on a device or whatever.

**[02:16:13 - 02:16:19]** But anyway, Rolu leaves a message, which is basically, this is my last message to you?

**[02:16:19 - 02:16:20]** Is that what he says?

**[02:16:20 - 02:16:21]** I need to meet you.

**[02:16:21 - 02:16:23]** I'm going to meet you in some place.

**[02:16:23 - 02:16:24]** You know where?

**[02:16:24 - 02:16:24]** Yeah.

**[02:16:24 - 02:16:26]** You know where?

**[02:16:26 - 02:16:29]** I don't know if he said it's the last message, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:16:29 - 02:16:37]** Because, like, he pretty much just said, like, hey, I'm leaving you this message because I found something.

**[02:16:37 - 02:16:40]** shoot, I don't know if this is actually going to get to you.

**[02:16:40 - 02:16:43]** This is probably going to be my last message.

**[02:16:44 - 02:16:47]** If it does get to you, then you know where to meet me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:16:47 - 02:16:52]** But my question is, like, that was before he died or after he, quote, died?

**[02:16:52 - 02:16:53]** Like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:16:54 - 02:17:19]** don't know so then i'm like wondering like for the listener john is throwing his hands up it wasn't like a timed out message it wasn't like a kill switch message i'm guessing so then it seems possibly still alive i don't know okay all right two things i think i don't think it is i think it was the message that he sent before he met you because he says you know you know where to be so like you somehow you received that message prior to this i think it's replay i think i think you're probably right that was that's my guess

**[02:17:19 - 02:17:22]** My biggest thing with it is he calls you sir.

**[02:17:24 - 02:17:24]** Yeah.

**[02:17:24 - 02:17:27]** Over and over and over.

**[02:17:27 - 02:17:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:17:31 - 02:17:35]** And with that laughter, pretend that was Shay's laughter.

**[02:17:36 - 02:17:42]** Because it's at this point that you're just starting to notice that things are starting to slow down.

**[02:17:43 - 02:17:44]** And then you level up, right?

**[02:17:45 - 02:17:46]** Same mechanic as last time.

**[02:17:46 - 02:17:47]** It's familiar.

**[02:17:47 - 02:17:55]** Even though you're not in Outpost Omicron, this familiar slowing down, this review, this recall of memories...

**[02:17:55 - 02:18:19]** comes through and you level up but then everything else seems to slow down because as you look out and the crew the void crier and narla and shay and everyone's like hold on what's happening with the asteroid because the one outpost that omicron was in it starts exploding first with these normal explosions seeming to indicate maybe that when dr okay asked so are we going to blow things up

**[02:18:19 - 02:18:20]** what's going on.

**[02:18:20 - 02:18:21]** They are normal explosions.

**[02:18:21 - 02:18:24]** But then they become green explosions.

**[02:18:24 - 02:18:36]** And then the whole asteroid splits apart, slows down, freezes in place, then reverses, goes into this green singularity in the middle of space, and then...

**[02:18:36 - 02:18:37]** vanishes.

**[02:18:37 - 02:18:38]** It's no longer there.

**[02:18:39 - 02:18:42]** And when you asked, because I think I've... Question about the reversal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:18:43 - 02:18:51]** Is it like it reversed in that it was no longer split in two, it was then a whole asteroid and then it dropped into that green portal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:18:52 - 02:18:58]** It reversed as in it didn't quite move backwards in time to reassemble.

**[02:18:58 - 02:19:03]** It just started to move back into the singularity, into something else.

**[02:19:03 - 02:19:04]** It went somewhere else.

**[02:19:05 - 02:19:11]** And what I'll say is that you are asking, right, what are these green orbs that are appearing, right?

**[02:19:12 - 02:19:13]** And you didn't go in that door.

**[02:19:14 - 02:19:23]** And again, there's this radiation aspect that's powering aplosomicron, but that radiation doesn't account for these orbs.

**[02:19:23 - 02:19:29]** And then you're thinking about, well, the troll has this quantum ability.

**[02:19:29 - 02:19:36]** And you think there must be a link or some quantum technology somewhere that we didn't encounter.

**[02:19:36 - 02:19:41]** Maybe that was in a place that you could have encountered, but you didn't.

**[02:19:41 - 02:19:42]** So.

**[02:19:42 - 02:20:00]** you know i'm not gonna say what it was but there's definitely a sense of maybe there's something that you might have missed that maybe it'll come up later because it seems like whatever explosions caused this place to start exploding that hits some sort of quantum technology and

**[02:20:00 - 02:20:08]** And that caused this asteroid to vanish into nothingness in the same way that the orbs did with the creatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:20:08 - 02:20:09]** Second question.

**[02:20:09 - 02:20:20]** Did we ever get clarification on whether or not the team of these fine fellows who are coming to rescue us hit the self-destruct button?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:20:20 - 02:20:31]** If you recall, I think it was Dr. O'Keefe who had a super high perception check, you did notice that it was Shay pressed a button on the captain's chair.

**[02:20:32 - 02:20:33]** Yep, little button.

**[02:20:34 - 02:20:36]** More to be explored in book three.

**[02:20:36 - 02:20:37]** Say that again about the button?

**[02:20:37 - 02:20:38]** Shay pressed a button.

**[02:20:38 - 02:20:40]** If you listen back, I'm pretty sure it was Shay.

**[02:20:41 - 02:20:42]** I don't think it was Darla.

**[02:20:42 - 02:20:43]** It should be Shay.

**[02:20:44 - 02:20:47]** They pressed a button on their captain's command chair.

**[02:20:47 - 02:20:48]** Before the reversal?

**[02:20:48 - 02:20:49]** Before the asteroid exploded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:20:49 - 02:20:50]** Oh, yeah.

**[02:20:51 - 02:20:53]** We assumed that he was triggering a bomb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:20:53 - 02:20:54]** Potentially.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:20:54 - 02:20:55]** Yeah, yeah.

**[02:20:55 - 02:21:00]** But the reversal happened, and that was unexpected, even to Shay.


## Speaker_0

**[02:21:00 - 02:21:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:21:01 - 02:21:02]** Seems like they were surprised, too.

**[02:21:03 - 02:21:04]** That was it.

**[02:21:05 - 02:21:07]** That was the end of book two.

**[02:21:07 - 02:21:08]** A lot of questions.

**[02:21:08 - 02:21:12]** Strange things setting up book three.

**[02:21:12 - 02:21:13]** What's going to happen?

**[02:21:13 - 02:21:23]** What's going to happen as you guys start to head to where they said, hey, we're going to go to a steward's base, debrief, relax, figure out from there.

**[02:21:23 - 02:21:26]** And, I mean, what could go wrong?

**[02:21:27 - 02:21:27]** Right?

**[02:21:28 - 02:21:29]** You know, there are six other books...

**[02:21:29 - 02:21:33]** Most of them are just detailing different resorts that you go to, honestly.

**[02:21:34 - 02:21:39]** So there's no conflict in the rest of the adventure, ever, all roleplay.

**[02:21:39 - 02:21:42]** It'll be super fun and super easy to brainstorm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:21:43 - 02:21:46]** Sure.

**[02:21:46 - 02:21:48]** Well, it was, it was a fun book.

**[02:21:48 - 02:21:54]** At times it was, I felt exhausted sometimes just because of the pace and how crazy it was.

**[02:21:54 - 02:21:59]** Like always, always having to do something, always having to survive, but it was really great.

**[02:21:59 - 02:22:01]** Some great moments.

**[02:22:01 - 02:22:02]** It was fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:22:02 - 02:22:07]** Yeah, I was just going to ask what you guys thought about book two comparing to book one real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:22:07 - 02:22:17]** So like from a listener perspective, because I mean, I'm in book two, but I'm in book two for like 18 seconds.

**[02:22:17 - 02:22:38]** um like as a as a listener book one was uh such a uh setting the stage where everyone was on even ground and um you know there was a there was a sinister aspect but it was more of a refined systematic issue than it was like a real and present danger um

**[02:22:38 - 02:22:48]** Where book two, it was both more your stereotypical dungeon crawler and also like you're never safe.

**[02:22:48 - 02:22:49]** You're never home.

**[02:22:49 - 02:22:57]** And it also, I felt like created space for each of the characters to fall more into their own fortes.

**[02:22:58 - 02:22:58]** Where Dr. O.K.

**[02:22:58 - 02:23:01]** could really lean into his life science.

**[02:23:02 - 02:23:06]** Where Kevin could really lean into just like murdering stuff.

**[02:23:06 - 02:23:08]** Stop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:23:08 - 02:23:09]** It was good at killing stuff, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:23:09 - 02:23:09]** Yeah.

**[02:23:09 - 02:23:10]** It was great.

**[02:23:11 - 02:23:11]** I'm happy.

**[02:23:12 - 02:23:17]** And like Colin pulling up in the 11th hour to heal everybody.

**[02:23:18 - 02:23:22]** I feel like it was an opportunity for everyone to fall into their roles.

**[02:23:22 - 02:23:26]** And I'm curious to see how those roles grow in book three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:23:26 - 02:23:29]** I also want to say, and that was very well said.

**[02:23:29 - 02:23:32]** I also want to say, like,

**[02:23:32 - 02:23:36]** there were so many choices where if we, there were just binary choices.

**[02:23:36 - 02:23:39]** And if we went like one way, we would have probably all died.

**[02:23:40 - 02:23:50]** Like the, we carefully choosing who to ally with, who to negotiate with, who to walk away from, like when to sleep and stuff like that, like made all the difference.

**[02:23:50 - 02:23:52]** And so that was very different from book one.

**[02:23:53 - 02:23:56]** We could have had a total party kill for sure.

**[02:23:57 - 02:23:58]** I feel like we got through it.

**[02:23:58 - 02:23:59]** Skin of our teeth.

**[02:23:59 - 02:24:00]** Yeah, we did.

**[02:24:00 - 02:24:01]** Yeah, we did.

**[02:24:01 - 02:24:02]** And our choices mattered a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:24:03 - 02:24:03]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[02:24:04 - 02:24:08]** Although I managed to stay pretty high on health points most of the time, but like I don't have that many.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:24:10 - 02:24:12]** I mean, that's part of your style of play.

**[02:24:12 - 02:24:14]** It's part of the biohacker and the mechanic, right?

**[02:24:14 - 02:24:17]** It's like you're not in a class where you're just going to soak up and frontline.

**[02:24:18 - 02:24:18]** Right.

**[02:24:18 - 02:24:19]** That's not what you're trying to do.

**[02:24:19 - 02:24:20]** You're doing a lot of other really...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[02:24:21 - 02:24:34]** Trying to maneuver my way through the life science, so to speak, of how to strategize and approach our obstacles.

**[02:24:35 - 02:24:36]** Was that a Carl Sagan quote?

**[02:24:36 - 02:24:37]** No.

**[02:24:39 - 02:24:41]** I have no pulse for the Sagan quotes.

**[02:24:41 - 02:24:45]** Those are all in our friend's podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[02:24:46 - 02:24:46]** Crossover play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:24:47 - 02:24:49]** Anything else that anyone else wants to add?

**[02:24:49 - 02:24:50]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:24:50 - 02:24:56]** I just want to say, sorry, listeners, if you are interested in learning more about that, you should hear our podcast.

**[02:24:56 - 02:25:13]** our crossover um not crossover it's not our like well there's a little bit of crossover actually our collaboration with um and what's it's called um traveling power pack power pack power pack you can check it out on um

**[02:25:13 - 02:25:14]** Yeah.

**[02:25:16 - 02:25:17]** He's not on that.

**[02:25:17 - 02:25:20]** So if you're a big fan of Benny and no one else, then don't, don't listen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:25:20 - 02:25:20]** Yeah.

**[02:25:21 - 02:25:22]** Then don't even, don't waste your time.

**[02:25:22 - 02:25:24]** Jen's not going to listen at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:25:24 - 02:25:28]** Actually, I think if you are a fan of Colin, you may want to check out our next feature.

**[02:25:28 - 02:25:30]** Kev, you want to plug that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:25:30 - 02:25:32]** Oh yeah, so coming up soon.

**[02:25:32 - 02:25:33]** Wait, are we finished?

**[02:25:33 - 02:25:35]** I didn't finish my book two stuff.

**[02:25:36 - 02:25:38]** We're not going to jump right into book three.

**[02:25:39 - 02:25:46]** I think we mentioned it in a couple episodes, but we are actually going to roll into... I'm taking over as GM for one story arc.

**[02:25:47 - 02:25:51]** I'm going to be running Junker's Delight, so if you're aware of that and understand it, it is what it is.

**[02:25:53 - 02:25:55]** But we're going to call that segment Unknown Treasures.

**[02:25:56 - 02:25:59]** And fun fact for everybody...

**[02:25:59 - 02:26:02]** This is my first time ever GMing.

**[02:26:02 - 02:26:03]** Ever.

**[02:26:03 - 02:26:03]** Yeah.

**[02:26:03 - 02:26:04]** Period.

**[02:26:04 - 02:26:06]** We've never even done a test session.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:26:06 - 02:26:07]** And he's going to do it perfectly.

**[02:26:08 - 02:26:09]** He's going to be great.

**[02:26:09 - 02:26:10]** No mistakes.

**[02:26:10 - 02:26:10]** I'm not going to rant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:26:11 - 02:26:12]** I'm not going to forget anything.

**[02:26:12 - 02:26:13]** That's the expectation.

**[02:26:13 - 02:26:15]** I'm not going to do attack opportunities when I can.

**[02:26:15 - 02:26:16]** That's the expectation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:26:16 - 02:26:17]** That's what's going to happen.

**[02:26:17 - 02:26:19]** There's no room for rants because there's nothing to rant about.

**[02:26:19 - 02:26:22]** It's going to be flawless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:26:22 - 02:26:23]** Because I'm the one that does the rants usually.

**[02:26:23 - 02:26:25]** I can't do that because I'm GMing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:26:25 - 02:26:29]** And then what I'm curious to see is what your rants will be about after you've now GMed.

**[02:26:29 - 02:26:31]** You'll just be ranting as a GM about like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:26:32 - 02:26:34]** I'll be honest.

**[02:26:35 - 02:26:37]** Thinking about running this game is giving me anxiety.

**[02:26:37 - 02:26:39]** You're going to be awesome.

**[02:26:39 - 02:26:41]** Don't worry about it.

**[02:26:41 - 02:26:42]** This is a one-time event.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:26:42 - 02:26:44]** We're going to understand.

**[02:26:45 - 02:26:47]** This is the beauty of GMing and DMing.

**[02:26:47 - 02:26:49]** If you do it terribly, no one knows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:26:50 - 02:26:51]** No one knows, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:26:51 - 02:26:53]** It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:26:53 - 02:27:11]** but I do want to say book one versus book two I think book one was fun they're both equally as fun I think I really enjoyed playing both of them I think that book one it's almost like we're going through like evolutions of emotions and book one was like curiosity I felt like book one was more mysterious interaction


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[02:27:11 - 02:27:12]** Two sets of the same coin.

**[02:27:12 - 02:27:15]** And book two is versus paranoia.

**[02:27:16 - 02:27:16]** Sheer terror.

**[02:27:17 - 02:27:17]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:27:17 - 02:27:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:27:18 - 02:27:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:27:19 - 02:27:21]** And I'm very curious to see what book three is bringing.

**[02:27:21 - 02:27:23]** Cause like we clearly have four more books to go through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:27:23 - 02:27:25]** I don't know what to expect.

**[02:27:25 - 02:27:32]** And I just want to say that this, this little break between two and three, uh, for, um, unknown treasures, um,

**[02:27:32 - 02:27:38]** Not giving much away here, but this is part of our developing universe of Will Save.

**[02:27:38 - 02:27:41]** So if you like what we're doing right now, you'll like it too.

**[02:27:42 - 02:27:47]** It's all kind of one grand world that we're crafting for you.

**[02:27:47 - 02:27:49]** You took the words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:27:49 - 02:27:52]** We're just going to go into those three rooms that we didn't talk about.

**[02:27:52 - 02:27:52]** That's it.

**[02:27:52 - 02:27:54]** Unknown treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[02:27:54 - 02:27:58]** It's literally just a separate AP just to go to those rooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:27:59 - 02:28:00]** So you end up on this thing.

**[02:28:01 - 02:28:03]** The troll's already dead, but you get to walk through.

**[02:28:03 - 02:28:04]** What doors do you go to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:28:05 - 02:28:07]** Kelly, you took

**[02:28:07 - 02:28:29]** the words right out of my mouth yeah we are definitely planning a lot of content and working within the awesome stuff that paizo is making with the star finder whole universe and all the adventure paths and especially these standalone adventures that are coming out uh you know joker's delight is the first of an extra galactic addition to the will save universe yes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:28:29 - 02:28:31]** Yeah, Paizo puts out some good stories.

**[02:28:31 - 02:28:33]** And so we're living within those boundaries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[02:28:33 - 02:28:36]** And we're creating kind of our own as well along the way.

**[02:28:36 - 02:28:38]** And, like, you know, making something special for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:28:39 - 02:28:40]** Which is part of the point.

**[02:28:40 - 02:28:47]** Especially if you're a GM or a player and you're exploring Starfinder as a whole, a lot of these stories are written to be a little bit open-ended.

**[02:28:48 - 02:28:53]** So you can put whatever character you want into that role and explore it.

**[02:28:53 - 02:28:56]** And then you turn around and you have other books like... Oh, shoot, what's the name of it?

**[02:28:56 - 02:28:57]** Galactic Magic.

**[02:28:57 - 02:28:58]** Galactic Exploration Manual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:28:58 - 02:29:02]** Yeah, Starship Operations Manual, Character Operations Manual, Galactic Magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[02:29:02 - 02:29:11]** Well, specifically, the Galaxy Exploration lets you build planets and create civilizations, and you can go completely homebrew.

**[02:29:12 - 02:29:17]** There's also a card deck that you can literally fold cards over and choose what's the next one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[02:29:17 - 02:29:22]** Honestly, just read, just open any Starfinder book and point to a random point in the page and read that section.

**[02:29:22 - 02:29:31]** And Paizo has already written in these things being like, hey, so this person, maybe this person is looking for adventurers to go help with a strange mystery that's happening.

**[02:29:31 - 02:29:35]** And you're like, they just drop storylines and plot lines in like every other sentence.

**[02:29:35 - 02:29:36]** It's really great.

**[02:29:36 - 02:29:36]** Yes.

**[02:29:36 - 02:29:37]** With that.

**[02:29:38 - 02:29:41]** Thank you for listening to book two.

**[02:29:41 - 02:29:42]** Thank you for listening to plot armor.

**[02:29:43 - 02:29:50]** Thanks for being an awesome part of the willing and awesome part of the, uh, we'll save experience as we like to say around here.

**[02:29:51 - 02:29:54]** And, uh, there it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06
