## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:00:02 - 00:00:26]** previously on will save our fearless foursome flocked around the ship with shay as colin craftily captivated both torv and orgot discovering torv's eye had been altered by the greys to be more than meets the eye they tapped into melt a man's mind to find it mirrors the mystifying memory maze much like bernice as these robots in disguise didn't remember diddly

**[00:00:26 - 00:00:32]** The quartet, questing quickly, queued onto the command bridge, united again with Captain Gnarla and the Pyke's peritons.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:41]** Dr. Roque, with keen kinesis, keyed into the cloaked gray craft and sought to quickly kindle a plan to Carl von Clausewitz the Greys.

**[00:00:41 - 00:00:42]** Gnarla...

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:59]** Nodding with noble nerve, nominated to go no-holds-bar, but in the end I was the notion, as she and Shay sank numbingly into a nap, as the pikes with piercing performance produced a perplexing pitch, positioning with predatory pugilistic poise at our protagonists.

**[00:00:59 - 00:01:05]** Will our fear-worn fellowship find fortune favoring them against these piping Pyke's Peritons?

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:09]** Or will the siren song be the fire and old curtain for our crew?

**[00:01:09 - 00:01:12]** Find out this time on Will Save.

**[00:01:12 - 00:01:14]** Will Save.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** I just dropped it on you, dude.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** I'm really sorry.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:21]** Literally, you were like, we all held back from banter.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** We all held back?

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:23]** You know.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:25]** We were going to come up with stuff, but then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:29]** I've got like a weird, I feel like all of mine are food related because I'm kind of a foodie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:30]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** That's fine.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:31]** Totally fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** So.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:33]** Aren't we all?

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** I was at Costco the other day.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Classic start.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** And I got a Canada Dry.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Love Costco.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** Ginger ale like variety pack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:42]** Okay.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** How many different types of ginger ale are there?

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** This is a strong starter, Vander.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:50]** There are at least three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** What the?

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** What?

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:51]** Okay.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** Why?

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** I don't even know this.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:55]** There's the normal Canada Dry, right?

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** Ginger ale, it's good.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:59]** It's great as a mixer by itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** Is there like extra ginger?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** I wish.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** There is an extra spicy version.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** There's a Canada Wet, Canada Moist.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:07]** Ooh, I would drink that so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:09]** Please stop.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:13]** Even one mention of that is enough to set Vinny off.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** It is.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** It's really amazing.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:17]** Don't say the word moist ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:20]** It's especially good when Bernie says it.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** No one in the Discord say moist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:25]** If they type moist, is it best?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:28]** I'm like legit asking.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** So go ahead.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:29]** Go ahead.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** Variety pack.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:30]** Variety pack.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** Continue on.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:31]** All right.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:31]** All right.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** My mistake.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** Let's not talk about it anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** Extra spicy.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** Canada.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:37]** Never mind.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:39]** Extra spicy meatball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** You people.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:46]** So there's one that's raspberry ginger ale, which is decent.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:47]** Sounds pretty good.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** My new favorite.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** Canada Dry Ginger Ale with Lemonade.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** Lemon.

**[00:03:54 - 00:04:01]** The lemon tartness really adds something to that sweet, spicy ginger flavor.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:09]** It also mixes well with whiskey or vodka or whatever you might listen to while you record your Starfinder podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:13]** You mind pouring me one too, Vinny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** So good.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:20]** And then he takes a long sip of whatever mixed drink he has.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:25]** Yep, that is ginger ale lemonade with some Western Suns vodka.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:28]** Oh, I thought you'd do whiskey with it, but all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** Out of Dallas, Texas.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:31]** See, that's the tough part of getting old.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:34]** Cause like all of my whiskey is really nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** Uh, you don't have any mix with mixing whiskeys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** I don't have any mixing whiskeys.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** I don't have any whiskey anymore.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:47]** I'm not like, I kind of missed my twenties where I had like a $20 bottle of, of whatever ABC had on sale.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:54]** Now it's like, you know, I reached for a bottle of Jack Daniels and it's the Sinatra select.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** Uh, I can't mix that.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** Not in good conscience.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** Uh,

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:02]** I think that's because you stopped going to ABC Liquor and you started going to Total Wine.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** Maybe.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:03]** That's true.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** I've got some standard proof.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:15]** We were all in Nashville a couple of weeks ago, and so I got some rye whiskey from there, and I mixed a little bit of that last night, but I feel bad mixing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** A little bit of whiskey.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:25]** We made a trip, and I had to hold bags as we were walking out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:26]** Yeah.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:30]** I mean, I got a couple of bottles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:35]** I ended up... I am drinking the Leaper's Fork that Kelly graciously got for me.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** Thank you, Kelly.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** That place was pretty good.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** You know, their rye was really good.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** Their rye was very good.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** Nashville was pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** I liked Nashville.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** That was cool.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** I didn't think I would like rye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** It was really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** What was the other one?

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:53]** There's Leaper's Fork and then the other distillery... Standard Proof.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** Standard Proof, yeah.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** Those are both standard proof, yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** Very good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:00]** And I'm not much of like a straight liquor drinker.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** And those are all very good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** Yeah.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:05]** I mean, that whole tasting I really enjoy.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Yeah.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** Because it's... Oh, there was the cat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** The cat with the thumbs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** The thumb cat.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** Yes.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** Oh, what was its name?

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** It was polydactyl on both paws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:19]** It had a name that was really appropriate for the fact that it had thumbs.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** And I can't remember what it was.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** Name from antiquity.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:47]** yeah it really was anyway it's i'm i'm very happy i've been running into more cats like that and i'm very happy thumbs you you run into a lot of them cats with six six fingers there's a lot of them yeah they're better at shaking hands yeah they are yeah exactly they can like unscrew caps for you and you know like if with opposable thumbs could do all kinds of stuff for you so can they pour vodka for you sure for you tom


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** I'm sure you can teach them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** We could make this work.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:55]** Can they get out of a room on Foundry?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:58]** All right, hold on.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** It's like a mouse.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** All right, listen.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** That door is not openable from the inside.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** It really wasn't.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:09]** It kept saying I had a token collision, and I tried every way to get out of there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** It wouldn't work.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:16]** This banter just went from like, that's a pretty good banter, to like, this is a good banter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:16]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** That was a good banter.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:19]** Thank you, Kevin, for letting me.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** You're welcome.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** You're welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:24]** All right, should we... Let's see if we can figure out combat in Foundry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:27]** He fucking hears and his soapy hands can't open up like, you know... I know.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** He can't rotate a door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:30]** He just put lotion on his pincers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:33]** He can't grab it right.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:34]** He doesn't know how to grab it.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:37]** Dude, you gotta... You gotta, like, take care of your carapace, man.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** It's very important.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:41]** You know, this carapace doesn't take care of itself.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** It's gotta look young and fresh.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:49]** You do look exceptionally fresh after your little jaunt with the greys.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** You know, so that's good.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** There's something that came out of that.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** All right.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Should we play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:21]** get on to this uh combat that we're talking about i think you you always ask us and like you need to stop doing that it's you define the situation john as i would love it if you don't tell me what to do just saying you should be more more like kev now that you've been a gm you're just flexing right john i didn't i never i never asked you f***ers i was like hey it is time for like kev gm'd one adventure and now he's the expert on gming


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** On just this aspect of GMing.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:23]** That's it.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:33]** There's a spectrum where he apologized every week, and now he's just like, no, I'm the bearer of all GM knowledge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:36]** If you have any questions, shoot them my way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:39]** We've created a monster.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:42]** Well, let me turn it over to my GM of the Lord, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:47]** I also read the Starship's operation manual, and I'm ready to board a f***ing gray ship and take them out.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:50]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:50]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** He's going to kill us.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** You're going to get us killed.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:56]** Just take it easy.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** Just take it easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** Last episode.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:22]** You all, let's say, explored some more hypnotic dreams and memories as you went with Shay to Torv, Gray Crag, and Orgot Noctis's, two of the Pyke's Paratons, went to their room to find out more about their own experiences.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:26]** Torv is able to give you some more information about

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:38]** adding to what you already knew that the greys spoke with each of you after your experiments in some sort of interview interrogation room.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:47]** But it was friendly, casual, calming, seems safe, at least for Torv.

**[00:09:49 - 00:10:05]** Orgat did not have a good experience and was not able to contain and have the strength of will to get through a frankly terrifying operation of having a hole punctured in your head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:10]** I got shot in the head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:26]** But given Colin's masterful hypnosis, a lot of the memories remained, so you were still able to ask, confirm a little bit more about who you all saw speaking with the greys.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** Turns out everyone was.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:36]** You head up, stop by Melt-A-Man, see a recording on the main deck

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:44]** From Melt the Main, you see a recording of Shay coming back to his room from a white light being phased in.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:51]** And then you decide, at Shay's recommendation, let's go tell Gnarla.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:58]** So you head up to the bridge, start talking with Narla.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:10]** I think it was a great conversation where Narla was leaning and leveraging y'all's expertise and experience and trying to take in some recommendations from Dr. Okay.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:18]** Couldn't quite get her to lose the urgency and the prioritization of

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:22]** of the crew over her own memories, but maybe we'll get a chance in the future.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:23]** Maybe not.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** To hypnotize her.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:34]** So the plan is, on the bridge, Shay, Narla, Ezra, Sparkles, Sarza Elm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Is it really Sparkles?

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** Did I miss that?

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Fetch's nickname is Sparkles.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:41]** So dumb, now that I know that there's a total dick.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** I hate that nickname.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:55]** Under the influence of some... And the four of you are standing there about to enact your plan to get out from under the thumb.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:58]** Of the gray drift shadow projector.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** Under the thumb.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:00]** I have that song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** Yes, that classic song, Under the Thumb.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** It's not that good, though.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** I feel like there are other songs better.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Yeah.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** So what are you thinking?

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:21]** You're going to pew-pew, shoot in that direction, and then burst out from underneath the drift shadow projector, allowing you, using your typical engines, allowing you to then re-engage your drift engine.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:23]** And from there, we'll see.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** We'll see.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:27]** We'll see.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:34]** Right as you are about to engage, Narla begins to scream.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:40]** And then Ezra screams and Fetch screams and Sarzael screams.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:45]** And their voices are a cacophony until they align in unison in pitch.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:50]** And then Shay and Narla crumple to the ground.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:57]** And Sarzael, Ezra, and Fetch stand up.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** Fetch turns around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:04]** They were right.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:06]** You can't stop yourselves.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** You deserve this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:11]** As her Yusoki hand comes out.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:25]** glowing red and i need you all for the first time in foundry to roll for initiatives i'm gonna bring you over to the void crier


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** Ah, yeah.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** Starting the music.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:33]** Let's go.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:36]** Ooh, I like this music, though.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** I like the music.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** I hate the roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:44]** Oh, do I need to roll in Foundry?

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** Is that how you're making us do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:45 - 00:14:11]** um if you want to tell me what you got that's fine if you want to roll in foundry that's fine remember remember that in foundry you need to right click on your token and then you need to click on the cross swords and shield icon and that will add you to the uh combat can i type it in click on the d20 next to your face right right right yep can i just type it in my soft no

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:15]** If you want to, let me see what I can do here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** I rolled really good.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:18]** I rolled a 19 plus 4 for a total of 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:22]** Mine says 16, but it should be 17.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** I forgot to add a modifier.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** So I'm going to let you deal with that, John.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:25]** Fix it.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:26]** Okay.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** Good thing I don't know how to do that.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:28]** Fix our shit.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:28]** Okay.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** Have you got a 23?

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:31]** Uh, yes.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:34]** And here's, you got a 17.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:34]** Yeah.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:35]** Okay.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** Bernice doesn't get initiative though.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** Um, that's fine.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:43]** You can, we can just make it at the same time as yours and we can just click through it.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:46]** Um, so what did you get doctor?

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:46]** Okay.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** I have a six.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:49]** Okay.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** And Colin, what did you get?

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** I got a 12.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** Got a 12.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:56]** Okay.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** So just for the listener, we're on the bridge.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** The bridge is actually very small.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:07]** It's about four squares to 20 feet across and then five squares long.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** So 25 feet long.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:13]** And the three of us are backed by the elevator area.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:18]** And then there's Gnarla's right in the middle and sitting in the captain's chair.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:22]** And then Shae is just north on the side to the kind of starboard side.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:30]** And then there are three of the Pyke's Puritans sitting at the council's kind of the front of the arc.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** And Dr. O.K.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** and Bernice are up near them.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** So I'm a little concerned about that.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** Question for Jon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:38 - 00:16:01]** so narla narla screamed narla everyone there screamed except for the four of you okay grabbed their heads narla and shay crumpled to the ground ezra sarza l and fetch stood up and looked eager to address the four of you let's call it so it's and it's rick's turn

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:07]** And we are starting combat in this nighttime orange glow.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:11]** I just like the idea of you all fighting nighttime on a ship.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:17]** It's a cool image in my head as the drift sits outside lurking.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:22]** Rick19, what are you going to do in the first combat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** Okay, so question.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** Bernice is small or tiny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** Bernice is tiny, I believe.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** Tiny construct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** Yes, tiny.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** So I can stand in the same square as Bernice.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** Perfect.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:41]** As Rick, because Rick is as far back from the councils as possible, just because he was ready to run down to a turret and take over a gun.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:48]** But he is going to just march forward, and it's almost slow and deliberate.

**[00:16:48 - 00:17:00]** He walks forward, stands right over Bernice, and as he does that, he draws out his battleaxe and is just going to swing at Fetch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:11]** I believe that you will get an attack for opportunity from Fetch because you step through a square right in front of them between Shay and Gnarla and then move into another square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:14]** So Rick walked three steps forward.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** and then one step diagonal.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:22]** So I did not take an attack of opportunity.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:23]** Okay.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:27]** You did technically step through the screen that's in front of Narla.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** Sorry, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** What are you saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:33]** Narla's unconscious.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** I can just step over her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:42]** Yeah, but there's a screen in front of the captain's chair, so all that I'm trying to say is that it's squeezing, so you would have lost some of your movement if you decide to move again.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** If you don't, then that's fine.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** But if you're going to attack, you won't worry.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:46]** Cool.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Let's keep going.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:49]** So you swing your hammer to work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:52]** As he's walking forward, he's going to say...

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:54]** As you swing your hammer to murder.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** I think that's part of the deliberate walk-in.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:00]** He's just fed up with a great... He's an axe murderer.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:08]** He says to his teammates at this point, it appears as if there was some kind of mental attack on them.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:13]** Gnarla and Shay must have failed their will saves.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:18]** And then he swings his axe for Fetch's head.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** Wow.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:21]** Okay.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:21]** Okay.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:21]** All right.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:30]** That's eight on the die for a total of 15 to hit.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** Against KAC?

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:33]** Yes.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** That's a hit.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** That's a hit!

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:35]** Woohoo!

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** I'm so excited.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** That's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:41]** You're like, great, let me just chop this Yusoki in half.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** I know, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** I've been waiting this.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** And that's a d12.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:44]** Four episodes.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:48]** It's a 12, and it's 12 plus 7.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:50]** 12 plus 7?

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** Wow, dude.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** So it's only 8 to hit, actually.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:56]** Or 8 damage total, because I rolled a 1 on the damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:58]** Okay, so it's 8 damage.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** Got it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Okay, eight damage.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** But whack, right in the head.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** Right in the kisser.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:05]** Wow.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** That is dangerous.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:16]** As blood starts to drip down their face, they continue to laugh at you.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:21]** It's going to be... Here's Fabricius.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:21]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:23]** What are you doing with your turn?

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:30]** Well, here's kind of knowing that Rick would go first because he was just so ready for killing.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** Get out of here!

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:39]** In that five seconds or whatever that was going on, he was watching it with smoking a cigarette.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** So he's like, all right, that was pretty cool.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:41]** I expected that much.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** And he kind of puts it out on the wall next to him.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:46]** And then he's going to... Which is the one who... Yours is so cool.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** Yeah.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** He likes to watch Rick work.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:56]** He likes to watch him do what he does, you know?

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:57]** Pretty nice.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:03]** All right, and then he flicks it at, like, who the f*** was smiling at him again and creepily, like, Sparkles, right?

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:03]** Fetch.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:04]** Sparkles.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** A.K.A.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:05]** Sparkles?

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** A.K.A.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:06]** Sparkles.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** All right, where is Fetch?

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** Is it that Yusoki?

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** Fetch is the Yusoki, yeah.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:13]** That's the one that's already attacked, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:15]** So Sparkles and Fetch are the same character, right?

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Yes, I know, yeah.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** Okay, all right, cool.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:18]** I thought you were getting me.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** You're like, oh, Fetch, and he's like, no, Sparkles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:23]** I'm going to call him Sparkles because it's dumb.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** Sparkle Fetch.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** Fetch.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:25]** All right.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:28]** You have a very ugly smile.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** I don't know.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** He smiled in a really weird way.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:35]** So now that here's this level five caster, he gets an additional magic missile, right?

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** But he's going to take a full action.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** Is that true?

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** Okay.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** That is true.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:42]** He's going to take a full action to cast four of them in this case.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** So that's three plus one for the full action.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:47]** At Fetch, because Sparkles, a.k.a.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:49]** Fetch, sucks.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:52]** So...

**[00:20:52 - 00:21:18]** sparkles was was was your favorite like the least threatening of all his mohawk was cool until now i thought that was the one that i was getting along with all right trying to cast it uh can no longer do it in hero lab apparently so i'm gonna bring out some dice sorry for the wait yeah real dice real dice real dice if you all would like me to add in your characters on foundry i can i my understanding is that we were going to do that so happy to do real nice and stuff


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** I got my Pirate-y metal dice right here.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:20]** Ooh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** I got the green ones this time.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** I like it.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:26]** Alright, so we have four.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** Yeah.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:29]** I'm doing the one modifier.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:29]** Two.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:32]** Three.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** What is it?

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** 4, 2, 3, 2.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** Not that much.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:40]** 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** Just 10 damage, unfortunately.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** But there you go.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** In the face of sparkles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** I'm sorry.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** What is the fifth level thing?

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** Where does that come from?

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:52]** Is it a mystic thing or is it a magic missile thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** It's per spell.

**[00:21:53 - 00:22:02]** So if you look it up on AONPRD.com, for example, they talk about this, but it's for every two caster levels beyond the first one, you gain an additional missile.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** All right.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:06]** So you get two additional missiles at the third level.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:08]** So that's three plus a full action makes it four.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:11]** Rules Lawyer, it's good to have you back.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:13]** I will find this and I will confirm it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** I know you will, Kevin.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:19]** I'm just going to say, I am, Kev, it's fine.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:21]** You can let it go.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:21]** I am ruling.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** I'm overruling you.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** First opportunity possible.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** First opportunity possible.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:26]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** First thing.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:30]** I trust y'all and what you're saying.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:33]** If it seems really weird, we'll get into it, but I trust you.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** So don't worry about it, Kev.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** 10 points of damage for sparkles.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:41]** Ten points of damage as Sparkles takes his hit.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:47]** And you see for a second as they laugh.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** And then stop.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:53]** Anything else you want to do on your turn here?

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** Light up another cigarette?

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** He just took a full action to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** He just took a full action.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:01]** Well, I guess you could light up another cigarette if you'll have that as a free action.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** Free action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:02]** All right.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** He takes another one.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** Quick light.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** I'm just... All right.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:07]** It is... I'm not seeing anything about this fifth level thing.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** I'm telling you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** I'm just... All right.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** I'll send it to you, my guy.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:13]** Sarza L. In front of you, Dr. Okay.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:17]** Their hand was already on their sword.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:26]** And it starts to swing out towards you as you see the smile on this dashing, bad-ass-looking elf.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:31]** You're gonna die.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:34]** He says as he's swinging at you.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:40]** And that is going to be an 11.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:40]** 11.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** To hit.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** Swing and a miss.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** Against KAC.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** That is a swing and a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:47]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:52]** just sort of does the Ip Man, you know, like...

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** Yeah.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** Watches the sword just go in front of his face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:08]** You can tell that it's, you know, Sarzael has some incredible training to just come right out from the scabbard to just attack you with their long sword.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:11]** All right.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:14]** They're not going to do anything else with their turn because it's a tight space.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** This is some tight combat.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** Two hits on fetch.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:23]** Not a hit on Dr. OK from Sarza L. It is now Fetch's turn.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:28]** And Fetch's red hand is still glowing.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:31]** And I'm going to use this cone.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** No.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** This cone measurement here.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** And this is going to hit.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** I'm going to need Rick19.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** Actually, all four of you.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** And Gnarla is going to fail.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:45]** I'm going to need all four of you to make a reflex save.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:50]** The four of you, Dr. OK, Rick19, Colin Edenbrand, and here's Fabricius.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:52]** How wide of a cone is this?

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:54]** It's a 15-foot cone.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Oh, my God.

**[00:24:55 - 00:25:06]** As the air around you starts to shimmer as heat begins to just overtake your entire body.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:10]** And how do I get rid of that cone?

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** I just got rid of it.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:15]** Thank you, Foundry, for being awesome.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** What save do you need?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** Reflex?

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** Yeah, it's going to be a reflex save.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Natural 20 from here.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** 17 from Dr. OK.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:27]** What about Rick and Colin?

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** 21 for Rick.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:30]** 21 from Rick.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** Colin?

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:32]** 22.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** 22.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** All of you pass.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Pass.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:41]** You each take six points of fire damage.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:42]** Okay.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:47]** As the heat, some of you maybe it heats up the metal, which burns into your skin.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:52]** Dr. K, maybe you just feel like all of the moisture in your body just getting wicked away.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:56]** And as that happens, you see Fetch again.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:58]** Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:03]** Does Bernice have to roll a reflex save?

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** Oh, Bernice would have to roll a reflex save.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:05]** Thank you.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:10]** I didn't see that Rick19 was stepping on the little guys in order to murder other people.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** 15 is a fail.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:16]** That's 12 points of fire damage to Bernice.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** Bernice is down.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** Bernice?

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:18]** No.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** First round.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:20]** Woo!

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:28]** Okay, solid round from little tit and tat from all y'all towards fetch.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** It's Colin Edenbrand's turn.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:32]** What are you doing there, Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:38]** Colin is curious about Gnarla to see if she, like, he wants to check her vitals to make sure that she's not dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:44]** Gnarla took 12 points of damage and Gnarla is not dead, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:45]** Awesome.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:51]** Then he wants to... Is she unconscious, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** Okay.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Is she stable?

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:56]** Yes.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:56]** How does he know?

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** You can do a medicine.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:03]** I just gave it away, but it seems like she's just unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** Yeah.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:13]** In that case, he's going to check his special abilities real quick.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:15]** Cool.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** Colin is going to move.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** No, he's not going to move.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** He's going to stay exactly where he is.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:26]** He doesn't like that Fetch used whatever he used because that was really uncomfortable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** She used overheat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:37]** She used overheat, and Colin's going to level his needler pistol at fetch and just pew.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Pull that trigger.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:42]** Pull it, shoots, and pulls it.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** What'd you get?

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:45]** That is an 8 plus 7, 15.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:47]** 15 against EAC or KAC?

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** Against...

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:52]** That is not abundantly clear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:56]** I think it's probably EAC from Needler Pistol, but I could be wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:56]** That's my sense.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** What's P?

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** Piercing.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:00]** Piercing.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** So that's KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** That's KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** So 15KAC.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** Okay.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:09]** 15KAC is going to be a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:36]** love to see it love to see it you love to see it one caltrop one caltrop d4 uh plus two that's a two for those on video uh two plus two is four so that's four piercing damage four piercing damage okay just take


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** Sorry.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:40]** Did you do a spell?

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** Yeah.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** So I should have gotten an attack of solidarity.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** Oh, yeah, sure.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:47]** And if I would have made contact, then you would have lost your spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:47]** That's true.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Yeah.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** That's true.

**[00:28:52 - 00:29:11]** yeah no i i appreciate that i was too busy this magic missile to pay attention yeah i think i think we're gonna rule that it happened but you should give me an extra hit then i'm just saying i should give you an extra hit okay all right yeah bernice wouldn't be down though


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:12]** It's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:15]** I would have saved a whole lot of damage.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** That's true.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** There was a lot of damage from it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** Okay.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** Do you want to roll and see if you hit?

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:20]** Let's do that.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:21]** Sorry.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:24]** That is a plus seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:29]** It's close quarters combat, so there's going to be a lot of AOs this whole time.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** Does a 20 hit?

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** That would have been a hit.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:31]** Yeah.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** It would have been a hit.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:32]** Okay.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:35]** That would have been a hit, and I would have lost the spell.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** Right?

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** Is that what AOO is for spells?

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** Yes.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:42]** If you get hit when you're trying to cast, you don't get to cast.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** All right.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** I don't get to cast.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** Sounds good.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:48]** So Bernice is up, and all of you gain 6 HP back.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:59]** Also, we'll note that I think Fetch gets some hit points because it sounds like, if I was reading it right, Kelly used the wrong rules for Magic Missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** So I was going to address that.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** So sorry, Kelly.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** I was right.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:05]** You were wrong.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:07]** Okay.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** Kelly was looking at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** Should we wait till Kelly rejoins us?


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:36]** uh yeah i mean we could probably wait kelly was looking at the pathfinder rules not the star and and pathfinder does scale if you easy if you get fifth level you get an additional if you get seventh level i think it's every two you get an additional missile which sounds nice sounds real nice but yeah that's not the case in style finder um so with that do i get to roll damage again


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:39]** Yeah, you can roll damage on Fetch.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:41]** So maybe it would have evened out anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** How bad is Fetch looking?

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** Fetch looks pretty hurt.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** That was after the magic missile, though?

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** Yeah.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:54]** Well, I think Rick would have... First hit was definitely going to be a lethal hit.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:57]** But I think after that, he's going to try to switch to non-lethal.

**[00:30:57 - 00:31:00]** Because he's not convinced that these guys...

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:02]** are in cohorts.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** Is that the right word?

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Cahoots.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Cahoots with the greys.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:09]** He thinks that they're being mind controlled.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** That's fair.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:13]** So drop that 20 down to a 16.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** That still hits, correct?

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Yes.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:18]** So yeah, then this is a non-lethal attack.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** Okay, non-lethal attack.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** Ooh, 10 on the die.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** Dang.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:26]** And I think it's a plus, what did I say?

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** A plus 7 of damage.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:31]** So that's 17 points of non-lethal.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** He just turns the axe.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** 17 points of non-lethal damage?

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:36]** Yep.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:49]** I think he kind of slashed the last round, and then before he even had a chance to look, he sees the spell happening, and he just kind of jams the top of the axe, the butt of the end of the axe, just into Fetch's gut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:55]** Fetch about to cast Overheat.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** Falls to her knees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:03]** Help me.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** What's happening?

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** What's happening?

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** Help.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:09]** Help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** And falls unconscious.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** Oof.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:16]** For the record, not a kill.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:25]** But takes them down, and as they are falling unconscious, not dying, seems to say, help me, what's happening?

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** What is going on?

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** Then it was...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:57]** then it was colin's turn yes thank you oh man and yeah yeah and you were gonna attack fetch and then fetch was already down yeah so you didn't need to shoot fetch with a kneeler pistol so what do you do now um i i get the impression that fetch is the only one that's displayed overt hostility towards us you want to make a sense moto check i do okay give yourself a uh plus four

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:00]** 12 plus 11 is 23.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:04]** That's pretty good.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:06]** Okay.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:15]** You know, you can sense that they all... I mean, Sarzael said, you're going to die to Dr. Okay.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:19]** So they all are showing hostility.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:26]** However, based on what Fetch was just saying, it does seem like they are...

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:42]** In a state where they are being motivated highly to attack and maybe that's overriding some of their wills and some of them might have stronger wills and occasionally can have an opportunity to break out of that conditioning, out of that programming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:43]** Gotcha.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:52]** Then I'm going to move down one square to have a more clear shot on Sarsa L. Okay.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:58]** And I'm going to cast Telekinetic Projectile.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** What is that?

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:06]** I'm going to pick up a screw that happens to be sitting on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** Okay.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** Casually, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** And just yeet it at Sarzael.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:19]** I feel like there's a thumb drive that you just... I was going to say, it's probably less of a screw, more of like a pencil or... Yeah.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** Stylus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:26]** Hashtag stoned for C. That is 16 ranged attack against its KAC.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:31]** What it doesn't say is what my attack roll is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:31 - 00:35:00]** probably your good question for telekinetic projectile projectile yes maybe your decks it's my it's my first guess you should have on I think on it should say you have like it just a regular range attack if you scroll down it says attack bonuses melee attack range attack thrown attack oh range attack dope yeah there it is on hero lab 16 plus 7 is 23


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:24]** 23 yeah that's a hit definitely yeah definitely hit a two so she takes two bludgeoning damage and then i'm going to pop back up to where i was can you do two moves yeah can you move attack move not unless you have the feet do you have unless you have the feet kevin


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** Did you take the feat?

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:25]** All right.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** He took the feat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:33]** There is a feat called agile casting that I have been waiting since the beginning of Unknown Treasures.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** All right.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** To talk about.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:42]** Thank you, Vinny, for being on top of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:44]** Yes.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:46]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** Sounds good.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:48]** I like it.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** I like it.

**[00:35:49 - 00:36:01]** So you step back, get a line of sight, and whisk your hands and fire and take this stylus that's sitting on the captain's chair and just jams right into Sarza El's leg.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:05]** Yeah, does the finger guns and then steps back.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:09]** I kind of imagine, too, as a little bit like a lean back, like a...

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:12]** Let me get a good eye on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** I'm going to shoot it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** Here we go.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Love it.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:14]** Amazing.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:15]** Cool.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** Awesome.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:16]** Good turn.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** All of y'all, good turn.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** This is still the first round.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** This is cooking.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:24]** It is going to now be, oh man, it's going to be Ezra's turn.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** Ezra.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:28]** Go ahead, cast a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** Do a ranged attack.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** It's cool.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** Actually, my reaction's already burnt.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** Never mind.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:32]** Damn it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:34]** Yep, that's what I was going to say.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** Except Dr. O.K.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:36]** has one.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:36]** I could.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** has one.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:39]** Okay.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:47]** You see that Ezra has taken out and all four arms, Kasathan arms, are reaching into four holsters.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:57]** And Ezra's going to use Fusillade and shoot all four guns at all four of you in one full attack.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:00]** And Dr. Okay gets an AOL.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Yeah, I get an AOL.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Yes, you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:06]** Does Dr. Okay have a melee weapon out?

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Ooh.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Yes.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:08]** Okay.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:11]** Well, I mean... Do they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:14]** That yes turned into a well really fast.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Yeah, I have to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:25]** So I always have one equipped, but I don't know the context of... I would assume that he would have it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:28]** What weapon is it?

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:32]** Is it your syringe spear?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:33]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:41]** That's GM call, but you can't really put a spear in your pocket, so like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:46]** Yeah, I feel like you have it readily accessible.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:49]** And I didn't say anything about this was trying to be a surprise round.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:57]** So I think it's fair that by now, at this point in the turn order, when you are last, that you would have got it out.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** I don't see an issue with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:59 - 00:37:59]** Yeah.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** I mean, it's not like I had it stowed away.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** It's always with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** Yeah, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:06]** Just in general, we'll just try and make it clear.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:09]** I mean, it wasn't your turn yet, but we'll just have to be like, oh, cool.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** I have this out and I have this out.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** It's fine.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** It's cool.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** I like it.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** You can do it.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Hit me up.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** Except don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:19]** Does a 17 do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** It does, man.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** Y'all are not missing today.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** Y'all all are hitting well.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** You're all hitting well.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:28]** I hope it stays this way the entire book.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** I hope it doesn't.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** Okay, so that hits.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:36]** What damage do you do?

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:38]** As we go back and look, you stab out.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** Oh, man.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** That's 10 points.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:41]** 10?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** Piercing damage.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** Dang, is that 1d6 plus 4?

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** That's wild, dude.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** 1d6 plus 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** Woo!

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** Wow!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** For the syringe spear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:51]** Dang!

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:54]** Y'all, level 5 is not a joke.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:57]** Dr. OK got some serious intentions behind that spear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:01]** Absolutely has some serious intentions behind that spear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:04]** And I mean, I didn't inject anything.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:08]** I didn't call it out because I would assume a reaction.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:12]** I wouldn't expend a biohack.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:12]** Right.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:12]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** Yeah.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** You just stab a mother.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:30]** OK, so all four guns come out and it is a barrage of bullets from these tactical pistols at the four of you.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:36]** Now, this is going to be a let's see.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:40]** It's going to be an attack roll on each of you.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:44]** So what I'm going to do is automatic weapons.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:49]** It basically allows for me to make one attack against each of you.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** Okay.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:55]** And it's in this cone of 25 feet.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:58]** So let me make sure that I can reach all of you from here.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Come on.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:00]** Come on.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:03]** The room's only 25 feet wide.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:03]** I know.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** I believe I can.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:05]** I just want to make sure.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:08]** Yeah, I can hit the four of you.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** Okay.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:09]** Got it.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:15]** So it's going to be my attack on Rick19 is going to be...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:25]** It says roll damage only once and apply it to all targets, but you roll to hit for each target.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** Also note... Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:29]** Thank you for rules lawyering me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:33]** Yes, critical hits cannot happen during automatic.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** Yes, there's no critical.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** Does a 22 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:42]** Does a 22 hit against your static arc pistol is going to be EAC?

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** That does hit, yes.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:44]** Sweet.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:50]** Okay, Dr. Okay, that's going to be a 23 against EAC, which I presume hits.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:54]** Here's, oh man, it's an 18 against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** Yeah, that hits.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:58]** I'm surprised my EAC and KAC are so low, but I can bring that up later.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** Yeah, that hits, as they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:07]** Also, you probably have soft cover from Rick19 standing right in front of you, and I'm right behind Rick.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:10]** So that would be a plus two, I think.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** To my EAC?

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** To your EAC and KAC.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:16]** Does 18 still hit?

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:18]** It would be for either armor class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** Your attack was an 18, right?

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:20]** Yes.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** No, it still hits.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** It still hits, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** Still hits.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:27]** Okay, and Colin, I got a 7 against your AC, which I imagine does not hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:29]** Plus 4 AC is soft cover.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** Plus 4 for soft cover?

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:31]** Yes.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** Partial cover is 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** Does Cigarette give me any cover?

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** What's up?

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** Does the cigarette give me any cover?

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Probably not.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** Does the cigarette... Yes.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** Yes.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** All right, plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** Yes, it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:47]** I still fucking lose the roll, so it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** I mean, the smoke might.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** Okay.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** We just counted as fog club.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** Okay.

**[00:41:52 - 00:42:04]** You all... So, Hears and Dr. Okay and Rick19 each take three points of damage as just multiple bullets hit all of you.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** You each take three points of damage.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:20]** You also see that as one gun just runs out of ammo, it's timed so that way another hand is reloading it and then reloading it.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:24]** So then at the end of the turn, Ezra is fully reloaded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** It is a feat that they have.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:33]** Fusilade is using all four hands with identical weapons.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:36]** So where's the free hand to allow reloading?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:40]** Do you want me to go into detail for you?

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** No, if you say there's a feed, I'll trust you.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** It's called Lightning Reload.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** But if you're going to question me, that's cool.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** You can keep doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:48]** You can listen to Lightning Reload.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:52]** I try to turn off Rules Lawyer, but as soon as that button is pushed...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:54 - 00:43:16]** let's let's keep going so ezra does a full attack barrage on you hitting here's dr okay and rick 19 for three points of damage and they are getting pretty close to uh because they got 10 points of damage right from dr okay's aoo which is wild so they do not look great at all and that's going to be ezra's turn it's going to be bernice's turn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:28]** Well, I can either use Bernice or give her a combat directive.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:36]** And I'm actually going to tell her and myself, and we're both going to withdraw as a full round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:38]** Withdraw as a full round.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:39]** All right.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** Because...

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** I don't want to be in mid lane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** That's fine.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** I like it.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** And I don't want an AOL.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** I believe withdraw means that you can't take an AOL against you, right?

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** So, yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** Yeah, you move twice your speed.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** Sweet, I love it.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:58]** So you can't swing and a miss if you're into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:01]** I think you could have just done a guarded step, though.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:05]** But he wanted to withdraw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** I wanted some distance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** So Dr. O.K.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** moves back to be next to Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:10]** And I like how.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:13]** Bernice is going to hang out by here's.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** And Dr. O.K.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:21]** is going to come down to the sort of the bottom of this tiny room by Colin.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:21]** Hey, Bernice.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:28]** And he's going to have his... Well, he can't do anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:38]** I imagine that Fetch fell and Bernice moved out of the way and then part, you know, because this is all happening in the same round, starts to get out of the way real quick.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** All right, good round.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:39]** Solid.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** We're in round two.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:42]** Rick19, who are you going to murder next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:44]** I didn't murder anyone.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:50]** So fetch is down, and Dr. O.K.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:53]** just left me in the middle of combat with everyone else.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:57]** But the only two people who are still up are Ezra and what's the elf's name?

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** Sarza-elf.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Sarza-elf.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:03]** So Sarza-elf and Ezra.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** You said Ezra looks pretty bad?

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Yes.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:09]** So with that, I think...

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:14]** I'm going to do a full round attack on... On?

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:19]** I'm going to do my first attack on Ezra and second attack on... Sorry to help.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** Okay.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:23]** And so first attack is a shoot.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:27]** That's only an eight to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:34]** And then the second attack... Slams into the console behind them.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:37]** Second attack is also an eight to hit.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:40]** So just slams right in front of it.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** It's too tight of a space for you.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:42]** Yeah, that's rough.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:49]** Rick 19 goes to swing this hammer again, which proved to be successful last time.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:52]** And this time just can't quite compensate for the tight pivoting.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** Fetch has now landed like right in front of you.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:57]** Maybe one of their arms, you know, her arms is out.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** You might step on it, lose balance a little bit.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:00]** Tough.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Tough, tough, tough.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:03]** Okay.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** That's my whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:06]** That was a full action.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** That's my full turn.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** That was a full town.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** Okay.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:09]** All right.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** Here's Fabricius.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** But I have a reaction again, so fuck with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:19]** The one that's not the Kasada is not yet injured, right?

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** The elf, yeah.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:22]** Sarza elf is injured a little bit, I believe.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** A little bit.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:29]** Yeah, so as I'm told mentioned while I was away, I was wrong.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** I was wrong, thanks to our rules lawyer.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** That's Pathfinder rules about the Magic Missile.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:37]** It's the only system I played where Magic Missile doesn't scale, and I'm very sad.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:41]** So I'm just going to cast three full actions on the elf.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** That's five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** It's one full action for three missiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** Correct.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** Just five, three...

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** And four.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:59]** So nine, 10, 12 damage.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** 12?

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:03]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** Big hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** Puts my cigarette out.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** Got to pull out another.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:10]** That's unfortunate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** I feel like one hand putting it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:14]** I don't know how cigarettes work, obviously.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:18]** Can you tell I don't smoke in real life?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:25]** Here's treats cigarettes like the Fast and the Furious treats gear shifts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** As many as possible.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:31]** Takes one puff, throws it away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** I'm going to do it.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:33]** One puff, throws it away.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** I need to go to a new webpage.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:41]** Let me shut down my computer and restart it and open a new one.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** Amazing.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:44]** So you shoot three magic missiles.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** What color are they again?

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** What do they look like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** Oh, that's a really good question.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:50]** Blue and then red and then green.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:50]** Oh, wow.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** Let's say that.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** They're beautiful.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** Wow.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** Some almost primary colors.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** That's great.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** That's some RGB, man.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:57]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** Some RGB.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:00]** When they come together, it's kind of like a rainbow color.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:01]** It's beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** Yeah.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:05]** They pass through the screen and there's a brief moment where there's a prison.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:34]** amazing it is now sarza l's turn and i guarantee you sarza l is going to be attacking here's the only question is i need to uh check on switching weapons here and whether that is a move action to switch weapons or action okay so it is dependent on your base attack bonus isn't it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:36]** Yeah, but we're already all past that.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** If you're not moving, it's still a move action.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** If you're moving, you do it as a move action.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:43]** But it's dropping one weapon and pulling one out.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:43]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** So, being hit...

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** And then that smile.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** The sword drops.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:57]** And then this rifle comes in to Sarzel's hand.

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:00]** The one that's in the picture of them.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** This azimuth laser rifle.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:09]** And you can just tell that they have a keen understanding with the rifle.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** And I believe Rick19 is about to do an AOL on me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** I rolled it.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** I'm just waiting on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** Tell me.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** What did you roll?

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** It was a 14 hit.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** Does a 14 hit what?

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** KAC or EAC?

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** KAC.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** KAC.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:22]** It does not.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** Dang it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:42]** me trying to be non-lethal here so Rick it's Rick swings at you and then like that happens he sees it happening he tries to like swing the the butt of or the like the staff end of the axe back and just hits the ground hard okay all right tough tough


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:43 - 00:50:09]** sars l aims down the site 16 against eac oh um that's me right that's it here's that's a you here's what is the apologies my hero lab crashed on my computer so i'm pulling up my phone and i'm checking my so i still have cover right soft cover is that correct i don't think so because now there's no one really in between you from across the room here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** I thought there was a screen in front of Gnarla.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:15]** Yeah, but it's not like preventing a shot between.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** Really?

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** It's like a holographic screen.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:20]** It's not preventing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** So why did Rick have to squeeze by?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** To move in between.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:29]** So that space between the captain's chair, which is sitting in between two squares and the space there.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** And Dr. O'Keefe, you were standing right in front of that.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:40]** So to get between somebody slumped in the captain's chair and you to move into that space feels like a squeezing movement.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** It doesn't mean the same as that there's cover.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:49]** And if there's a chair in the room and we're both standing, is the chair providing cover against you if I shoot at you while standing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:52]** These are the important questions in life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:54]** I mean, typically a captain's platform is raised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:58]** I'm willing to debate them until we determine that I get a plus two.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:58]** So, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** That's fine.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** If you want to do that, I can tell you.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** No, no, no, that's fine.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:07]** If you want to say that, I can tell you that Starz already has a boost to attacking opponents with cover.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:11]** So we can do that if you want.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** We'll accept this outcome.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** That hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:16]** Does 16 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** Because it's kind of low.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** Oh, it does.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:19]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** That's why I'm curious.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:20]** It doesn't make sense.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:24]** I thought I completely leveled up, but my EAC is a 14 right now.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** My EAC is a 12.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** My KAC is a 14.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** It seems suspicious, but whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:28]** Check your armor.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:29]** Make sure you have it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:31]** We need to check your armor because that does sound a little low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:33]** I have Kasafa Microchord 1 on.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:35]** Yeah, it's already applied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** Okay.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** Kind of weird.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:42]** Well, it's only four points of fire damage, so it's not that much.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:44]** It's definitely not what it could be.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:49]** So it's four points of fire damage as a shot from this rifle rings out across the room pretty loud.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:53]** Given my new experience with guns, it is probably not quiet.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:57]** Well, but the cool thing is that I don't have to pull out another cigarette now because it's back on.

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:00]** Oh, because it just lights the cigarette.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:00]** Amazing.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:02]** I love it.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:03]** Cool.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** Good stuff.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** That did burn a little bit, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** Okay.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:10]** It would be Fetch's turn, but Fetch is unconscious on the ground.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** And it is now Colin Edenbrand's turn.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** What are you doing, Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:30]** I am looking up healing channel because I'm trying to figure out if it's 48 per creature that I heal or if it's a 48 pool that I use to heal all of the creatures around me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** I think Healing Channel is pretty dope.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** Healing Channel?

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Is that Mystic Connections?

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** Oh, Healing Channel.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:35]** Yeah.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Who are you trying to heal?

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:38]** Healing yourself with a channel is a move action.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:40]** Healing an ally you touch is a standard action.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** Healing all allies is a full action.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** Restores 2d8 hit points increases.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** Who else hurt, though?

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** I feel like we're all pretty strong.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** I don't see why it wouldn't just go to everybody.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:53]** If you're going to take a full action to heal everybody, everybody gets 2d8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:53 - 00:53:19]** or or in four or sorry for d8 right yeah right i guess what i'm trying to figure out is how that might affect narla or shes like as they're unconscious as the ones that have been slumped over i think cullen's impression is that they have been adversely impacted by this mind control because they rejected it and so the grays were like no them we're just gonna knock them out yeah

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:26]** So, Cullen, as a medical professional, I think is trying to bring them back up.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:32]** So... It would also... If you wanted to, you could also try to heal Fetch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:33]** That.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:37]** I'm going to burn a resolve point to do... To what?

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:43]** Healing Channel on Gnarla Yalaris.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:45]** Do we know that they're out because of...

**[00:53:45 - 00:54:05]** yeah do you want to do a check to see what's going on uh yeah let me do that okay do that to make sure that they are not knocked out for any make sure it's not wasted yeah yeah fair totally fair they're just drunk i'm assuming that's a medicine check that is a medicine check 24 24


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:11]** I can tell you that it seems like they are not out from, yeah, any loss of hit points.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** They've been conditioned to be knocked out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:22]** Is that enough to know whether a remove condition lesser would resolve it for them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:43]** a remove condition lesser wow this is a this is a deep thing i'm seeing it you can remove shaken sickened or staggered which doesn't seem like to me it would be the same as waking pulling somebody out from being unconscious it seems different i'm not saying you can't but it just doesn't seem like the same

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:55]** So it seems like you were trying to determine if you could wake up Narla and Shay from their state, let's call it.

**[00:54:55 - 00:55:02]** And you were considering using a resolve point, and then you were going to roll medicine check.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:03]** So what was your medicine check?

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** It was 24, right?

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** Yeah.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:27]** yeah okay i mean you can tell that remove lesser condition would not help and they they seem like they are at full health so it seems like uh using a resolve point to bring them to more full health is not maybe the best use of that cool yep uh i guess he's gonna just like fire some shots okay

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:47]** at sarza l sarza elf who also is looking not great just by the way both ezra and sarza l awesome try not to kill them you doing non-lethal yeah we can stabilize uh i don't know if you can do non-lethal with a needler pistol you can you think you can four yep minus four


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** Sure.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:50]** 16 non-lethal.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** 16 KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** That hits.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:59]** They were looking down their gun and just didn't see you shooting with your gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** Awesome.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:06]** That is four piercing non-lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** Four piercing non-lethal damage.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:09]** Yeah.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** As it sticks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** For kneecap damage.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:14]** Specifically kneecap?

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:15]** Specifically kneecap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** All right.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** That's fine.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** Oh, God.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** Oh, God.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:21]** The kneecap.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** No, the knees.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** Oh, God, the knees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:24]** I took an arrow to the knee.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** All right.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** Who shoots at the meat?

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:33]** You shoot at Sarza Elf's knees as they took their shot at Hirith Fabricius, dealing four points of damage.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:34]** Awesome.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:36]** Love it.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:38]** It is now Ezra's turn.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** And you know what Ezra's going to do?

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** Another ranged attack?

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:46]** Another barrage of shooting again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:51]** But now you have a reaction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:53]** Didn't you already take your AoO on Sarza Elf?

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** It's a new round.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** No, I thought you took that this past round.

**[00:56:55 - 00:57:03]** I remember saying when Sarzel was going to attack and you missed because you were close, but you came down because I was shooting at... Here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:06]** Is Sarzel after me or before me in the turn order?

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** Because I'm first in the turn order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** Sarzel is after you.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:09]** You were first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** Oh, then I guess I did use my range.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:11]** Sorry.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** I remember your reaction.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:13]** Dang it.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:14]** Tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:32]** tough stuff uh that's only a nine against eac for you rick 19 which i don't think it's right you shot me i wasn't paying i got distracted because i was too busy yes i'm doing a barrage the same barrage of four arms shooting four pistols again all right so you what was it what was it to hit

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:35]** It's only a 9 against EAC, so I think you're fine.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:36]** Yeah, great.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:39]** So it's going to be a 23, though, against Hears.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:40]** Ouch.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:42]** And let me make sure that I can still hit everybody.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** I don't know if I can.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** Yes, I can.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:44]** Okay, cool.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:48]** That is going to be a 21 against Colin, which I believe hits.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:52]** And that's only a 14 against Dr. Okay.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** Does that hit your EAC?

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** What type of weapon?

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** It is an electric weapon.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** Static arc pistol.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:57]** That misses.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** That misses.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** Love that.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:00]** Okay.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** Okay.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** All right.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:12]** Uh, so here's, you are here's and Colin, you're going to take three points of electric damage as this barrage lights up the entire room.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:15]** Okay, cool.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:15]** Cool.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:19]** So you all take three points, Colin and here's, and that is going to be Ezra's turn.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:23]** They don't appear to reload their weapons.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:24]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** And Bernice, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:29]** Um, well, seeing a barrage, uh,

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:38]** sort of nods to Bernice to also deliver a barrage.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:42]** I mean, not in the same way, obviously, but just for flavor.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** So Dr. O.K.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:49]** is going to put away the syringe beer and pull out the cost jet.

**[00:58:50 - 00:59:20]** liquidator and bernice is going to draw her well she already had the vapor cavitation pistol yeah that's right i forgot about that i love that and uh we're gonna do a little crossfire so bernice is up in the up upper right of the screen is gonna shoot down at um sarza l so as not to uh incur any cover i think that's fair dr okay is going to shoot up at ezra was a cost x double fire

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:21]** Yep.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:22]** X marks the spot.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** X marks the spot.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** We'll see how it goes.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:24]** X going to get you.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:34]** And I think he'll end up giving the, I think, yeah, I think he's just going to hit him with the regular cost of jet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** Regular cost of jet.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** Okay.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:40]** What are your attack rolls on each of them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:42]** All right.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:42]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:50]** Rolled a 17 plus six for a 23 hit on that's on Ezra.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:53]** Wow.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:55]** And damage is.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:55]** Yeah.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** What's our damage?

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** Max damage.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** Eight points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:59 - 00:59:59]** Eight.

**[00:59:59 - 00:59:59]** Wow.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** Cool.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:05]** Sweet shot across the room.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** Hit Nezra.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:09]** Bernice gets a 17.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:13]** Bernice gets a 17 to hit.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** Yeah, that's a hit.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:15]** Okay.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:15]** Yeah.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:20]** And you said Bernice was firing up to avoid cover or was like up in the air.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:27]** No, because if she's firing down, I'm just thinking across the room down.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:30]** So we're in the upper right and lower right.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** They're in the upper left and lower left.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** Yeah, I don't think there's any cover there.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:37]** Yeah, there's no cover from what I can tell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:45]** Actually, I think, sorry, I hate Ruslan to cry about this, but Rick19, where he's standing, would provide soft cover.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:47]** because you'd have to pick a point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** Only at the corners, though.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:51]** You said you could draw to any corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:51 - 01:01:01]** If I draw to this bottom corner, there's no... You pick one corner of your square, and if any corner of the enemy's square passes through...

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:24]** so so bernice would have soft cover on either of the two where if dr okay attacked uh sarzel he would have a clean shot but he would have uh soft cover or everyone have soft cover so if you both target sarzel only bernice would have soft cover so and soft cover is again plus two right plus four


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:27]** Plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:28]** Is it partial, though?

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:29]** Is it partial or soft?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]** Soft is because of a person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]** It's soft cover because of Rick.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:34]** Rick is the soft cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:34]** Oh, I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:36]** Okay.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** Okay, so then it doesn't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:40]** Well, so your attack roll on Ezra was what?

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** Was it 17?

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:43]** It was an 18 minus one, 17.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** 17 against EAC?

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** That was against EAC, right?

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:46]** Yeah.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** Yeah, that still would have hit.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:50]** And then what was your shot against Sarzael?

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** What was the roll?

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** 23.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:54]** 23, definitely still would have hit.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:57]** Okay, good look though, Kev.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:57]** That's good to know.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:06]** If there's going to be any corner that goes through a person, this goes both ways for y'all and for me, then that's what happens.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:08]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:09]** Yeah, Sarazel gets...

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:12]** Five points of... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** Cool.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:14]** Love it.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:18]** I rolled a five damage from Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** I got the five damage.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:25]** So five damage to Sarza El and a good amount of damage to Ezra as well.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** Good stuff.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:27]** Good round.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:30]** We'll crossfire X attack action.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:34]** And it is now going to be Rick Knight Teen's turn at the top of round three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:34]** Oh, right.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:35]** Come on.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:36]** Die.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** So, sorry.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** They're both still up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:43]** They both look very, very hurt.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:47]** And they both are, like, still smiling.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:55]** So, whatever Will Fetch had, they both are still smiling and laughing as if they are gleefully attacking you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:55 - 01:03:01]** I am not going to risk a full attack, so I'm just going to do a regular attack, but it's only a plus three because it is non-lethal.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:01]** On who?

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** On Ezra.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:06]** And that is not going to... Oh, it might.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:09]** It's a nine plus three for 12.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:11]** 12?

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** That's not going to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:12]** No?

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:13]** Okay.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:13]** No?

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:14]** Yeah.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:14]** Sorry.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** Hears, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:20]** Hears reaches into his pocket.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:21]** Lights another cigarette.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:22]** Shuffles cigarettes out of the way.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:23]** No, not this time.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:23]** Yeah.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:32]** And then he... His hands... One of his hands rests upon this smooth ball.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:33]** That sounds really weird.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:35]** But what he does is he takes it out of his pocket.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:38]** And then it's this Pokeball-shaped thing.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:40]** And he throws it forward.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:40]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:45]** Generally, he's going to basically throw it at the head of the elf, who I can never remember the name of.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** Just bang it on the head.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:49]** And then the Electrovor will come out.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:50]** Sarazel.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:52]** And, as usual, edit it in.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:57]** We must have the Pokemon theme.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:58]** Electrovor!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** Electrovor!

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** I choose you!

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:03]** you're trying to hit a certain square.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:05]** I think you just need to roll a raised attack.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:08]** It's AC five to hit a square to hit the square that you want.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** What do I need to roll?

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** Uh, like, like a range attack.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:14]** So whatever it says on hero lab for a range attack.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:15]** Yeah.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:15]** Yeah.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:22]** I'm just trying to make sure you're, you're probably going to make it with your bonus, but just in case you don't, cause I don't know what your bonus is for raise attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:28]** I love that Hears is such a nerd of anime that he actually put the statuette in a ball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:29]** I know.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:30]** Yeah, that he can shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:31]** Yeah.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** Amazing.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:34]** I do.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** I do like anime.

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:38]** Join the Discord and talk about anime with me on the anime channel, actually.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:39]** All right, so 17.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:40]** 17 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:44]** Definitely, definitely you hit the square that you want.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:46]** And the Electivore can attack on the same turn, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:48]** I believe so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:50]** What's the attack going to be?

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:51]** Unless, you know, we parachute Kevin in.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:55]** But it's a tail slap because I don't want to electrocute everyone.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** It's a one.

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[01:04:59 - 01:04:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:00]** Good Lord.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** What do you have to roll?

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:04]** I guess that's like a KAC or something, right?

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:05]** It's a physical attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:07]** It would be against EAC if you're attacking.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:09]** Well, a tail slap is KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:10]** Yep.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:12]** What's your attack?

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:13]** All right.

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:14]** So in total, that's a 20.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:16]** Does that hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:17]** Yeah, that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:17]** Absolutely hits.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:21]** So now I'm going to roll a 1d4 plus three.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:21]** Okay.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** Okay.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:29]** So that's six points of bludgeoning damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:35]** Ezra, or sorry, Sarza Elf goes down.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:43]** After being hit in the knee, leans down, oh gosh, from Bernice, and then gets hit in the face with a tail slap.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:45]** Sarza Elf is down.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:48]** Was that lethal or non-lethal damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:50]** Well, I mean, it's a tail slap.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:51]** I don't think it would kill someone, would it?

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:52]** I was intending to be non-lethal.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:54]** No, it's lethal unless you say it's non-lethal.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:55]** Oh, I'm sorry.

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:55]** It's non-lethal.

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:56]** That's what I meant.

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:58]** I believe that still hits.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:00]** Minus four to hit then.

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:01]** That's fine.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:01]** It still hits.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:05]** Just want to be clear if it's lethal or non-lethal.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:09]** Okay, so Sars-Ellis is unconscious.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:10]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:13]** Electrify!

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:20]** He rotates his bandolier like Ash Ketchum, but it's all the same shape really all the way across.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:21]** But, you know.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:21]** Amazing.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:23]** He did something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:23]** Amazing.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:25]** Colin, I like it.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:25]** Good turn.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:27]** Colin, what is your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00
