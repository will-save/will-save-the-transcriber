**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** I'm going to say something nice.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:25]** And then when I'm done, that person then chooses someone else and says something nice.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:30]** And we'll just, we'll go around and until everyone has had something nice said about them.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** No, Chase is here.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Cause Chase is kind of me.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:33]** Oh yeah.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** Chase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:37]** Chase is kind of the Doge from last week.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:38]** Yeah.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:39]** Yeah.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Screw that dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** We're still ready to go.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:43]** I'm going to compliment Kelly.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** I love how the positivity devolves so fast.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:49]** Very fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** I'm going to call Kevin.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:55]** Kevin always has a way to sidetrack us into another rabbit hole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** And that's how we're kicking it off.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:58]** That's good.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:00]** Kevin, who are you going to compliment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:10]** Don't ever come and kill him.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** No, not Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:16]** I love that you are so...

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:33]** informed and aware of just like the audio visual aspect of things that like when i was setting up my new office and still i need to put things on the walls and stuff but he was like no you look good like we could we could adjust this but it was like it was criticism without criticizing

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** And it was great.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:40]** And he's just always so helpful about setting up the frame and just knowing what our images should be.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** So thank you.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** Thank you, Vinny, for contributing.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** That's nice.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** That's really nice.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** That's really nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** Thanks, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** It's a sweet moment.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** I wish I saw it.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** Yeah, I wish we recorded it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** Right?

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** I know, dude.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:54]** Oh, well.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** That's fine.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** Make that motherfucking ringtone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** Kevin complimented you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:01]** That'd be great.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** The whole thing.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:04]** The whole 30 seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:06]** Make it your ringback tone.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:11]** That way, whoever calls you just gets a really, really happy vibe.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** You guys remember those?

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]** I looked them up, and they don't exist anymore.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** It sucks.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:15]** Really?

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** You can't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** Sad state of affairs when you can't do that anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** I once annoyed my ex-

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:25]** There was a girlfriend I had like, I had this, the Mentos theme.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:29]** So every time she would call me, it would just be like the Mentos theme.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:32]** It'd be like, she hated it so much.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:36]** It took me years before I removed it and she suffered the entire time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:41]** I love that your solution was, I'm going to change my entire ring back tone to the Mentos theme.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** I'm going to break up with her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** Secondary.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** She hates Mentos.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** I'm going to make her break up with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:56]** We're still friends, so here's to you, dude.

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:07]** I know you listen every now and again, so... I'm full of life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:26]** So my compliment was going to be to Kelly for always going there, whether it's a comedic bit of trying to like steal armor or like a really heartfelt, you know, this sort of around character that grows through the story.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:29]** I can always count on Kelly to go there with me.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** So thank you for that, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:32]** Thanks, man.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:36]** I think Vinny and I have a lot of shared interests and we don't talk about them enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:42]** You do talk about them on the pod and I feel like only on each episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:42]** I know.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:46]** Kelly, we should talk like outside of when we record maybe.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:46]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** Outside of the office.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** When I text Vinny, he doesn't respond.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:51]** That's the thing.

**[00:05:51 - 00:06:14]** so then like oh okay well this is this is starting to devolve from the comments yeah you were the one who broke it kelly so what is who is your compliment for and what what are you saying

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** This is hard.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:21]** I don't know who to choose.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:22]** It's really difficult.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** You only got two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:28]** Oh, did Kevin already get complimented too?

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** That's right.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** Did I get a compliment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:35]** No, Will complimented Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** That was backhanded.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:44]** I mean, you know... That was a backhanded compliment.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** The thought crossed my mind.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** That was a joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:50]** I wasn't trying to actually... Don't do that shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:56]** If I was going to pay Kevin a genuine compliment, I appreciate his...

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** What's the word?

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** I don't know.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:02]** His outgoingness towards others.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** Yeah.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:07]** Strangers and friends alike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:09]** Kevin is a real life cartoon as he puts it.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** And I wouldn't agree.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** Like, yeah, you are a cartoon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:16]** Kevin is the lifeblood of every party he's ever been to.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:55]** You gotta earn it.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:57]** Nothing happened in the hotel room, per se.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** We were in Scotland.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** Okay, alright, hold on.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:04]** See, the thing is, it's gonna sound the wrong way when I say this, but we learned a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** It doesn't matter how, it doesn't matter where you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** We did learn a lot about each other.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:09]** We learned a lot about each other.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:11]** I learned that Kev... Just stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** Really knows how to channel his anger.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** He really knows how to tap into that aggression.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:18]** Where do you think the term chaos monkey came from?

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:22]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:24]** I got to stop.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:25]** Yeah.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:27]** You know, double tree.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:29]** This is for double tree because I got to stand up.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:33]** You need to make one fucking cookie.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:38]** Okay, every time you go to DoubleTree, for some reason, the thing is like, they give you two cookies.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:40]** Kevin, they don't have nutless cookies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** I just want a chocolate chip cookie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** I don't want nuts in my cookies.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:51]** How dare they give you a fresh, warm cookie when you check in and it has nuts in it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:54]** What if you're allergic to nuts?

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:56]** It's been warm every time I've checked in.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** They don't eat the f***ing cookie!

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** I didn't eat the cookie!

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** But I wish there was one that I could.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:03]** Like, they couldn't just have a non-nutted version?

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** You know, they should.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** That's like crazy.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:06]** They should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** Nuts are like the most common allergy, pretty much.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:10]** So, you know, it's time, DoubleTree, to get it together.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:13]** We'll send the might of the willing against you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:16]** What's the point of having two trees if you don't have two types of cookies?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:19]** Wow, Kev.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:22]** You were asking the tough questions.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** You were asking the tough questions here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:27]** I hope you like this cookie because you get another one of them.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:30]** If you don't like this cookie, you get two.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** It's all or nothing, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** You know what, DoubleTree?

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** I will gladly take Kevin's cookie.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:39]** I will bring you some of that free cookies next time.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** I will take Kevin's cookie.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:44]** I will sacrifice myself for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:46]** I will stay in a better hotel.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:46]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:52]** And that is the Will answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:57]** That is Will's answer to a lot of things, though.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:59]** He's like, I need a better room or a better hotel, please.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:05]** And then you show up, and he's made friends and played poker with the security already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:09]** I've never met anyone else I would confidently say this about.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:11]** Will is a hotel connoisseur.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:12]** He is.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** He is.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:17]** The way people sample wine is how Will stays in hotels.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:17]** Aficionado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:17]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:22]** He just kind of walks in and breathes it in.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** I'm getting some shame.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** You can see the star rating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:31]** Oh, you're not going to take my bags from my car to my room?

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:34]** Just from the lobby to my room?

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** Oh.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:24]** Oh, wait, you're Captain Planet and we're the Planeteers.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** Together we make you powerful.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:29]** Who's heart?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:29]** Is that true?

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** I feel like he would just be fire.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** I'm clearly heart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:34]** I feel like I'd be earth.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** Yeah, you'd be earth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** I feel like I'd be air because I'm a Gemini.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** Is there air?

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** Is there atmosphere?

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** I don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:46]** What's the... I'm water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** Your powers combined.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:50]** Do you use the annoying fire?

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** If we go by Zodiac.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:56]** Do Earth, Wind, and Fire make a band outside of the rest of the Planeteers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:59]** Yo, did they split off and have greater success than the rest of the Planeteers?

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:00]** Earth, Wind, Fire.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:03]** Causing a forever rift and they never play together again?

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:05]** And then they became archenemies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:34]** and oh and then they became arch enemies wow okay cool i like this new lore that we just dropped last time it was paw patrol this time it's captain planet have you guys seen the last thing kev yes yes yes okay what it's amazing don cheetle as captain planet is amazing if you're listening there's like four episodes totally watch it google it it's like funny or die or something yeah it's so good don't watch it now benny don't do it don't but i see that look but we can i don't

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** But you have to listen.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:40]** Stop.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** Stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** Stop sharing it.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:42]** Kelly.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:42]** Yes.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:46]** Did you want to shout somebody out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:46]** No, no, no.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:48]** I'll do it every now and again.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:51]** This time I want to double down on the shout outs for you.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** You know what I mean?

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** Like you have double cookies, a double tree.

**[00:14:53 - 00:15:00]** I just feel like I agree with Vinny's compliment because I... Yeah, John's very important.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:04]** When he was away on his honeymoon and everyone was like, don't talk to us.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** You're on your honeymoon for like three weeks.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:06]** Like, yeah.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:09]** Even then, he was, like, chomping at the bit to do stuff for Will Save.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** Yeah, I messaged you guys a lot.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:12]** Yeah.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** I'm like, don't talk to us.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** What are you doing?

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** Go back to your honeymoon.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** Enjoy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** I'm literally waiting on a balcony.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** I'm just sitting here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:22]** He's like, oh, look at this beautiful Italian sunset.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:23]** Fuck that.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** I got to do Will Save stuff.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:30]** Anyway, so, like, no, but when he was gone, he's like, okay, guys, like, you should have, like, business meetings.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:30]** You know what I mean?

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** Like, just have business meetings when I'm gone.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** And no one did anything.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:36]** No one did anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** That's not true.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:42]** John wrote out the agenda every week and then we walked through it quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:47]** When did we ever have a meeting when John was gone?

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:47]** Twice, I think.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:49]** Kelly, we've been meaning to tell you this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:56]** Kelly, I think you and I are the planeteers that got left behind, dude, by Earth, Wind, and Fire, bro.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:59]** I think we got left behind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** Is it because I'm the annoying fire guy?

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:04]** No, it's just because of the way you can drink drinks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** Or what's her name?

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:10]** The Eastern European, the Soviet Union one?

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** No, what's her name?

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** She's like, Eloi, I'm from... Oh, f***.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Sorry, Soviet Union.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:18]** Former Soviet Union.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** There it is.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:53]** I have said this without reservation.

**[00:16:56 - 00:17:03]** And so like, thanks to you for, for like making a dope story out of this tabletop RPG.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:08]** A story that I could look at that and be like, I want to do that with those guys.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:14]** And then here I get to sit doing that with those guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:18]** Thank you, sir.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:18]** Thank you, Vinny.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:22]** And Vinny was like the ultimate.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** He was great.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** He was a good guy.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:29]** He's grown so much as a player and as characters have too.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:32]** It's really cool to get to know Vinny.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:50]** um and this could be you someday though willing you could be part of it you could join i don't want to say something like that transition yeah oh wait no i do have a shout out i do have a shout wait hold on i just want to say benny thank you for not off-ramping when you figured out how to change and remove the tempo from our audio


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:54]** and not being like, hey, guys, I really want to join, and then you fix our production, and then you leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:58]** That alone would have been a good contribution, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:01]** That was not an insignificant driver in the decision-making.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:14]** So, like, I don't know if anyone listens in the car, but, like, when I pulled up the podcast in my car, it would say, we'll save the podcast, episode 56, tempo 120.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:20]** And like within three episodes of joining, I was like, hey, John, by the way, you know, I figured out how to change this.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:23]** Also, that's why I joined.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** Goodbye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** I don't know if I fixed it or not.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** I haven't tested it yet.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:29]** I'm sorry.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** Cents for sharing confessions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:35]** And then I was like, okay, cool.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:35]** Anyway, sorry.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** Go ahead, Kelly.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:38]** All right, so I am going to shout out someone after all.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** This is to you, Zellout.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** Z-E-L-L-O-U-T.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:54]** You've been commenting frequently previously, including in the Rules and Mistakes channel, but you haven't really done a rules correction yet, so I'm not going to make you a rules paralegal yet.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:23]** Looks great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:25]** Still not zooming in.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:25]** It's a wolf, I promise.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:31]** If you want to see Zellout's profile picture, join our Discord at discord.willsavethepodcast.com.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:31]** Yes.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:35]** So, Zellout, I know that you're a burgeoning artist, like you're...

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:37]** You're wanting to move in that direction.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:43]** I just want to let you know, because you've been posting in the art channel various characters that you have been working on.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:49]** I really like them, especially your profile photo looks like really cool, like the dog wolf kind of thing.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:53]** Yeah, I would just say just keep doing it and keep working on it.

**[00:19:53 - 00:20:01]** And you've kind of hinted that right now things are kind of difficult for you in terms of your personal space and time and everything.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:03]** And I just want to wish you luck.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:19]** luck to get out on the other side of it and from personal experience you just keep swimming and you'll get through it and keep doing your art okay and we appreciate you talking to us on there keep doing your art keep doing your art draw something every day or else you'll be like me and never draw again

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** Yeah.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** Kevin, nevermind.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:26]** Kevin's a good one, but he never, he doesn't have hands.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** He did.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** He did.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** Here's one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** I lost it.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:29]** I don't have the ability.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** I should have committed to it.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:31]** I never did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** That's so, that's so not true.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** You, you can totally do it.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:34]** Yeah.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** I believe in you.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:38]** And also just one more shout out to everybody listening and watching.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:38]** Thank you.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:45]** Without you, we, uh, we would not be able to make such a wonderful show and just have a good time and share it with you all.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** And it's amazing to get to talk to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** Feedback and your support.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** Always.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** What aliens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:24]** Can I make one sidetrack in Kevin's vein?

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:29]** Duke Nukem was a character on Captain Planet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:29]** Really?

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** Are you serious?

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:34]** Wait, Duke Nukem from the video game.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:40]** It's not the same, supposedly, but... Oh, there's a guy that looks like Duke Nukem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:41]** I can see this.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** I think I know who you're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** That's cool.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** I went down the rabbit hole, and I'm like, whoa.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** That is awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:47]** That was fun.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:51]** Duke Nukem was on Planet, like, Captain Planet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** He was a villain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:55]** He was the, like, rock dude.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** It's not the same Duke Nukem.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** It's not the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:01]** but they had to change Duke Nukem's name.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** That was his name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** Yeah.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:04]** That's cool.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Which I did not know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** That's his name on Captain Planet.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:07]** Duke Nukem.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** Duke Nukem.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:10]** But he's from the thing from Fantastic Four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** Yeah.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** Oh, I know that guy.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:13]** I know that guy.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** Yeah.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** Captain Planet was a great show.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** Duke Nukem is a fun game.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:18]** I had the original.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:19]** Captain Planet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:28]** I'm sure I've talked about this before, but I used Duke Nukem as, or Captain Planet as like an age limiter.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:33]** Cause my friend's girlfriend was, she was like, oh, I was born in 1990.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:36]** And I was like, you gotta be kidding me.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:39]** Like the fact that you were born, you know, I was just like amazed by it.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** I was like 22 at the time.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:41]** And she was, she was like 18.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:44]** And I was like, so you're from the next decade.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** And I was like, do you know what Captain Planet is?

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** And she had no idea.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:47]** No.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** It was like 89.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:50]** If you're born in 89, you knew.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** But if you were born in 1990, it was gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** False.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Yeah, false.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** Penny and I were born in 90.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** It was very anecdotal, limited time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** Whoever you are that Kevin's talking about, you suck.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** Finish this lyric.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** And you should watch better shows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:05]** Captain Planet, he's our hero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** Gonna bring pollution down to zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** There it is.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:11]** And Kev, because you insulted me, I'm gonna insult you.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:15]** Duke Nukem represents the misuse of nuclear power, which we all know is evil.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:17]** That's where I was going with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:17]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** Do you want a universe like Duke Nukem?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** We left Compliment Circle long ago.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** Now I gotta go look.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:29]** I'm gonna read Duke Nukem now that I realize if Captain Planet's against nuclear power, I don't know if I can... Then Kevin is against Captain Planet.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:31]** You're going to be the next villain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:34]** He's going to be Captain Pollution.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:35]** Thank you, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** You know what I mean?

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:42]** Those villains that mean well, but they're evil.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** That's all great villains mean well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:48]** He means well, but he's going to eliminate nuclear power and by that, destroying the planet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:55]** Kevin, or sorry, Will, thank you for this tangent, and we'll return next week with more of View From History.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** Bye, Will.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** Bye, Will.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:59]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** So, you did it.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:04]** You survived your starship combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** You made it through.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** Took some hits to the Void Crier.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** Some glitching engines.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** And got your feet wet.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:21]** Learned how to work as a group in yet another tough scenario.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:31]** If you think about it, you guys have had to work through a mystery without Colin and a murder on the Chimera.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:41]** You've had to work through the sudden change of your perspective of your reality and dealing with that as you make your way through life and death of a

**[00:24:41 - 00:25:11]** very unstable station trying to answer questions meet new fantastic creatures that are only of myth and lore and then bringing somebody in colin and then bringing in your friend frog fighting this massive you know quantum troll from another freaking dimension here making it out alive working with the stewards getting on a ship dealing with being abducted and then now in starship combat

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:15]** That's a lot of positivity.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:17]** That's a pretty impressive crew.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** I'm not going to lie.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** It's a really impressive crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:20]** Thanks, man.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:23]** I mean, yeah.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** I'm surprised, like... Oh, never mind.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** I want to keep it positive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:28]** I mean, it's a pretty good resume.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** We should do this professionally.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** Yeah.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** You should think about starting a podcast, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:33]** I don't know.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:36]** I don't know how you consider...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:41]** If you want to hear more about Starship Combat, just listen to the past three eps, two eps.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:48]** I think I just want to jump right back in to where we are on the bridge.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:52]** Thank you, Kelly, for that nice slurp.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:52]** That was good.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** That was really good.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:53]** No, no, no.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:54]** I loved it.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** I loved it.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:57]** It was great.

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:01]** So let's jump into, I'm going to bring you guys over to the Void Crier.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:01]** I saw that.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:03]** Thank you.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** We're going to jump on the bridge.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** Colin Edenbrand is in the turret.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** I moved you to the turret.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:17]** And Kaniko, Rick19, Dr. OK, and Here's the Situation Fabricius are on the bridge.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:23]** Ezra, Shay, Sparkles, Sarza L, and Gnarla are unconscious.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:30]** And Kaniko turns to you and says, are you all seeing what I'm seeing?

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** I think we got him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:36]** Yes, I see on my targeting screen that the target has been obliterated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** Colin taps into his headset.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** I saw a big explosion.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** Are we dead or did we do it?

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** That explosion was not us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:48]** We're still here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:50]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:53]** Nice job, everyone.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** I have to say, that was amazing.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** I am proud of all of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** That was harrowing.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:04]** With your encouragement, Kanika, I think we could have easily... We couldn't have done it without you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:08]** I would not have been able to do it without the four of you, so...

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:08]** Thank you.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:12]** And she turns and looks at Rick and then her face sours a little bit.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:21]** She recalls that Rick is wearing Shade's armor and then looks at Hears and recalls that Hears is wearing Orgoth's armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:27]** I still stand by the fact that it's canon that she kind of dug Hears so Hears just gives her a wink.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:32]** You all hear a from behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:37]** Rick stands up and draws his weapon and points it at whatever the noise is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:42]** It's, Gnarla appears to be opening her eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** What?

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:46]** Colin.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** What happened?

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:52]** Colin, feeling a shade left out, leaves the turret stand and heads to the bridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:56]** Why, why am I on the floor?

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** And you hear, ugh.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:58]** Ugh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:04]** Oh, God, that's a f***ing headache.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** I hope old God doesn't wake up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:09]** Shay starts to wake up, too.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:11]** Did you do something, Kelly?

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:13]** Did you do something, Hears?

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:16]** Well, it's weird that I didn't wake up.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:16]** That's weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** Why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** It says Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:28]** Why are... Sorry.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:32]** Did you all tie up Shay and Gnarla?

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:34]** Or just everyone should be tied up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** You should have seen what happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** They all went crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:41]** Why am I tied up here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:46]** You sort of tried to kill us.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** Yep, can attest to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:49]** Shay and Gnarla didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:52]** They started to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** No, they passed out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:54 - 00:29:12]** but they were part of the like uniting scream thing the rest of your crew tried to kill us and so we did it as a bit of a precautionary measure so that's why that's why sars hell and and fetch and ezra are tied up and i'm uh oh god


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** That's exactly why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:16]** That's why I'm assuming everyone else is tied up, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:21]** If you'd like to relive those moments, I'm happy to hypnotize you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:24]** I already have a headache, Sean.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** Let's talk about that when I get over this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:30]** Before we go any further, Dr.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:34]** O.K., can you perform a live scan to make sure that we have killed the crew?

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:37]** If not, there might still be danger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:40]** Sorry, you killed the crew of the Void Crier?


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:41]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:49]** Uh, there was a gray ship, uh, that we've been fighting for the past, uh, how many rounds?

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:49]** Six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:53]** So how long is a round in starship combat?

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** That's a good question.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Yeah.

**[00:29:55 - 00:30:02]** Keniko says, uh, look, Narla, I have to say without these four, we would not be safe here.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:05]** And I know that all of you are bound up.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:08]** Uh, the Pikes Peritons did try and attack us, uh,

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:14]** But I have to say, these four here have absolutely been outstanding in saving the ship.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** They are single-handedly responsible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** Ed, we didn't kill anybody.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Yes, they didn't.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** They are all unconscious.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** Let's not overstate it.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:25]** I don't know that we're safe here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** It's a fair play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** All right.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:31]** Well, God, I see what you're saying about that headache.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:34]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:38]** Then perhaps maybe it's time for me to be unbound.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:41]** And Kaniko starts to walk over to untie Narla.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:49]** Is there any check that we can do to make sure they are still not even capable of being taken advantage of by the greys?

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:53]** As I said, we are not certain that the threat is gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:54 - 00:31:15]** and fetch and sarza l and ezra start to move their feet they start to kind of wake up and open their eyes colin steps over to narla and says hey what what do you remember over the last 48 hours hours hours hours


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:22]** I remember about to take on this gray ship, and then I screamed and blacked out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** Very, very strange.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:26]** Sorry, point to order.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** She remembers the gray ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:31]** Yes, we were talking about the gray ship.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:37]** suggested that we do a sweet flip and burn scenario.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:40]** That would have been mad sick, so I would love if we had done that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Would have been just burn.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** We don't... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** You can't flip and burn.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:47]** Still... Still sick, but yeah.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** Still like a sick move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:50]** Yeah.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:56]** Actually, there's... Thanks to Leslie for pointing out the flip and burn is actually... To stop.

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:00]** When you flip, yeah, you burn your thrusters to... And it makes sense mechanically.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:01]** Come to a stop.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** It does.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:02]** For sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:05]** It's still a bullshit misnomer, but sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** It's a burn flip burn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:08]** Sorry.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** Why...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:27]** tied up as we're talking um you were a bit homicidal not too long ago oh so uh we decided to take you out oh i'm so sorry just a precaution that's all that must be sure to control you

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:33]** Yeah, there were some greys off the ship, and they were messing with everyone's minds.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:35]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:38]** We made sure not to hurt you.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** We just brought you down safely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:41]** Doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:48]** I mean, I do have kind of some, like, you know, some wounds, and I'm kind of sore, but it's not too bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:48]** It's fresh.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:49]** It's good.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:58]** Doctor, you and I both have done a good bit of non-lethal damage on this ship.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:05]** Should we make a ship-wide communication maybe and head down to the mid-bay to offer first aid to anyone who might need it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:06]** I can.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** Yeah, I can make that.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** Not with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:18]** We are still not certain of the mechanism by which the greys took over this crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:24]** Is the ship just completely obliterated, or is it... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** It's totally... Can we do a live scan?

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** You can do a scan.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:32]** You don't need to roll a check to know that it's gone.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** Totally destroyed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:39]** It didn't do the whole green absorb thing like the... Did not.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:44]** Blown to... Can we loot anything?

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:48]** Is there any good armor or weapons?

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:52]** With the armor that you have, you ask.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** I know I'm not going to keep this armor.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:55]** I'm sure he's going to ask for it back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:55 - 00:34:01]** The real mission of Threefold is finding where you get the audacity to ask that question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:01]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:06]** There's a... Here's my thing.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** I know this is not the end of book... What book are we on?

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** Book three?

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** There's no way we're at the end of book three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:13]** Yeah, that would be surprising, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:18]** And so I know we're going to get into more combat, and I don't know when that combat's going to happen, but this armor would be helpful.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** That's all I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:26]** Here's going to remove the name tag and, like, tuck it in his... In his what, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:29]** He has pockets and shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:34]** It's a pretty, Kelly, I'm going to say it's not a name tag.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:38]** It's clearly a personalized armor set for Orgat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:46]** It's just a huge O. The father, the son, and the audacity of here's Fabricius stealing the armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** Exactly.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:53]** There's a and there's a there are prisoners here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:55]** And they would like to get out.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:57]** It's Meltaman talking.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** Thank you, Meltaman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:01]** Let's head down to the brig.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:05]** Should we get ourselves back on course first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** Yeah.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:09]** So, Gnarla, maybe you want to say something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Yes.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** Kaniko has finished untying her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:16]** I really want to sit around in gray territory if we can help it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:32]** Narlow walks over and just kind of leans over with her head, like, on one arm and puts her hand on the intercom that's in the ship and says, This is the newly awakened captain speaking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** We are...

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:37]** I believe no longer under the threat of the greys.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:40]** I repeat, we are no longer under the threat of the greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** False statement.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:44]** How can you know that for certain?

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:46]** Pushes the thing to turn off the code red.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** I mean, you did a scan.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:50]** There are no more ships in the vicinity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:56]** But I mean, that doesn't mean that the greys don't exist still and that they can't be a threat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:06]** To be clear, I was not saying that the greys have stopped existing, but I mean that in the immediate vicinity of this ship, I believe that we are no longer under the threat of greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:09]** We're not under imminent threat.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:11]** Thank you for that correction.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** I will put it in my notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** I concur with your adjustments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:15]** And I just want to give another thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:20]** We did leave a gray base to be followed by grays after blowing up their base.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:28]** And so, I mean, you know, it just stands to reason that we should still be weary about such... The very definition of f***ing around and finding out, really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** She...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:50]** turns and looks at you and dr okay and says i want to personally thank all of our omicron companions for their hard work in ensuring the safety of the void crier without you it sounds like we the crew might have attacked you and i'm deeply sorry about that so thank you for keeping everyone alive


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:55]** Some of us might have begun to awaken.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** I'm sorry, the intercom's still here, so everyone's hearing you.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** I'll talk right now.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:07]** If you are able, if there's anyone else here that needs to give an all-call or respond, then please do.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:11]** And you do hear a, I'm all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:14]** I'm a bit woozy.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:18]** I'd rather make it here, but I'm all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Or we're talking.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** He's in the room now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:24]** No, he's talking over the intercom because she didn't.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:24]** How?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** He's tied up.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** How is he getting to the intercom?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:27]** He jumped up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** And I'm wearing his armor.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** So he doesn't have a commut.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** Wearing armor doesn't mean you can't move.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** The commut is in the armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** There's a commut in the kitchen.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:40]** Oh, he's over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** Okay.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:44]** But thank you for bringing that level of realism to our show.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:44]** Right.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:49]** All I'm going to say is I'm kind of excited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:59]** What if they, what if they, um, the stewards actually try to deputize us and we become like unit Omicron or something along those lines.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** You would like that, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** I would like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:10]** Rick is like, Rick is you, you, uh, you, you kind of sit for the stewards.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** I got to say you really, really, really,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:18]** They are a valiant effort among the scourge of the universe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:24]** Look, Shay and I are going to get our ship back on course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:30]** Please, Peritons and our Omicron companions, just relax.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:32]** You are all probably hurt.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** Take some time to get yourself healed.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:37]** We will get the ship back on track.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:41]** And then we will have another update soon.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:42 - 00:39:07]** i do suggest that everyone on board undergoes some kind of medical proceed not procedure what's the word uh evaluation evaluation to make sure they are no longer under control of the grace sure we can we can set that up that's not a problem i would like to get starting on track because that guy was suspicious okay noted that orvia was suspicious


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:16]** Narla looks over at, at Hears and says, Hears, why are you wearing Orgat's armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:20]** And why is, why is Rick 19 wearing Orvir's armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** Who said this?

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** Narla.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:26]** Well, I mean, I'll just explain.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** He'll just explain the same thing that he told.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:29]** He's just going to say the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:36]** Kaniko starts to go down that road and Narla just says, you know what?

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:41]** I'm sure that there is a reason in saving the ship.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** You don't own the armor.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** You need to give it back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** But just deal with that, please.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:52]** And she sits down and closes her eyes and starts to try and, like, take inventory of what's going on with the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:56]** Dr. O'Kane and Colin lock eyes during this and start giggling with each other.

**[00:39:56 - 00:40:00]** I don't know how f***ing ridiculous the whole thing is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:05]** I will admit that I commandeered this armor for the sake of surviving.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:11]** And I was afraid that we would have to combat the greys directly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:14]** And for that... During starship combat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Sure, that's fine.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:17]** Just give it back to Orvia.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** That's all that I ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:22]** She doesn't have the emotional input.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:22]** Alright.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** I licked it.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** It's mine now.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Alright.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:34]** He cleans his armor every night with a toilet brush.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:42]** Gnarla does do another, I'll call and say, look, please make your way to the med bay.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:52]** It would be fantastic if we can confirm that no one is under any of this gray remote power ability.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:56]** Just please make your way to the med bay and we'll do a scan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** Thank you.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:03]** And Ezra and Fetch and Sarzel start to make their way down there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** Can I release the prisoners?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** No.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:08]** Not yet.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:11]** Let's get them to the prison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** They are asking to get out.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:15]** It sounds like they are back to their normal selves.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** Thank you, Meltaman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:20]** We'll be the judge of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:24]** Shay, why don't you go down and figure out what's going on with him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:30]** I'm happy to oblige a medical examination as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Okay.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:42]** So Colin starts to go down to the med bay where the other crew, you're following Ezra and Fetch and Sarzael.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:50]** Shay is walking down to following you because he's going to the brig to check on the other crew.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:53]** Okay, will you be joining me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Yeah, I will tag along.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:56]** Okay.

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:00]** If I can remember how to operate this stupid contraption.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:04]** Yeah, I think this also... Oh, is it?

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:05]** Is it the lower deck?

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** It's the middle deck.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** It's the main deck.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** Cool.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** It's the main deck.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Main deck.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:17]** I've clicked the lower deck elevator thing, but now I don't have a way to get back to...

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Do you need me to come save you?

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** Do you need a light on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:23]** Rick is really good at saving people that get stuck in ships.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:29]** I think... As we step into the elevator... So what do Rick and Hears start doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** Well, Rick is following closely with the rest of them.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:36]** He still has his gun up and... Not ready, but ready-ish.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:37]** Standby.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:39]** Okay.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:45]** And he whispers to Colin when nobody else can hear and says like...

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:50]** Would your ability to hypnotize anyone be of use now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** I expect so.

**[00:42:53 - 00:43:02]** The need for hypnotism is for recovering that 24 hours, hours, hours that everyone lost.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:09]** And based on what we've heard from Nala, these folks have lost that 24 hours as well.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:15]** And so if they want to relive it or give us some information from that period, then yeah, sure.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:18]** It's a bit of a hellscape to relive.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:24]** And so I'm going to leave it up to each individual patient to decide how they want to handle it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:33]** I will express concern that you have not performed it on anyone who was affected but not taken over by the Greys.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:37]** Specifically, Gnarla, Shay, and... No, you hypnotized Shay.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** Oh, Shay we did, yeah.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:44]** But not post the actual attempt to take over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** Well, you haven't hypnotized anyone post takeover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:48]** Aye, they were all trying to kill us.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** Right.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** As you walk down, Orvier sees you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:55]** Oh, that's one of my honor went.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:55]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** How's it feel?

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** Oh, I love it.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** It's good, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** Yeah.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** Pretty positive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:03]** He walks over to Orbeer and shakes his hand.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:11]** And he's like, I apologize for taking your armor, but I felt it was the best at the time for me to be prepared in the wear.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:18]** And he starts to unclasp the gauntlets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** Yeah, no rush on that.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:24]** Just give it back to me whenever you want, you know.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:35]** To be honest, it sounds like you've got the qualities of a parrot, and so if you ever decide that you need to jump in, I appreciate you adapting and protecting yourself.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:36]** So that's good.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** Thank you for that compliment.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:37]** Yeah.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** No rush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:40]** Just get me the armor back whenever.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** That's fine.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:42]** That's fine.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:46]** And Orbeer starts to walk in as a leader.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** Well, you know, just...

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:51]** Before we leave the ship.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** End of day.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** Before we leave the ship.

**[00:44:54 - 00:45:03]** And Orvi actually walks in first because Orvi is just being a good leader to do a quick check and scan with Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:06]** Orvi, let's have a seat on this bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:06]** Yeah.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:09]** So Orvis is down.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:15]** You start to... What are you going to be doing with them to check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** I would like to roll a medicine check.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** I'm going to take his vitals.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:23]** I'm going to check for any physical ailments first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:27]** Have you had any thoughts of harming others or yourself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:29]** No.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** Yourself or others.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** Harming yourself or others.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:38]** It's a 17 medicine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:42]** Yeah, I mean, just looking him over, he doesn't have any.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:46]** Right, like his PCP would first, just to make sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:49]** Yeah, just like taking heart.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:52]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** He seems to be fine.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:56]** Call it.

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:00]** Okay, turn your head and cough.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:14]** Meanwhile, you do hear the sound of voices down the hallway as Shay has begun to let out Ludwia, Tor, Ael, Hesper, Orgut.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:16]** They're all feeling the same.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:20]** Not feeling great, but they are clearly not in their homicidal state.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:30]** So Colin turns to him and says, there's been about one day that's been removed from everyone's memory and

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:40]** You can see the conflict on Colin's face as he's trying to decide how much to share, and says... What happened?

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:49]** It's been different for each patient, and so as we think through it, the decision is yours, because the memories are yours.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:54]** If you relive it, I can unlock them for you through hypnotism.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:59]** However, you should know that they are quite harrowing in most cases.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:09]** So if it's something that you're ready to relive and can maybe share that knowledge with the rest of the crew, I'm happy to hypnotize you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:12]** Sure, you know, I wanted to... He kind of leans in.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:17]** I wanted to come in here just to set an example for the rest of the Paratins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** I'm happy to do that with you.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:25]** Can we just all stand out to the side and make sure that everyone gets, you know...

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:27]** checked out and make sure that they're okay first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** It sounds like this might be a little while.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** So why don't you do that?

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** I'll be here with you.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** I'll make sure that my crew's okay too.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** And then we'll go from there.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** Yeah.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** All right.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:38]** Come on in.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** Who's next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** Well, hang on.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:47]** Before we invite anyone else in, are we not hypnotizing you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** Yeah, so that's what I meant.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:55]** Sure, but let's get everyone else checked out first, because they might have some injuries.

**[00:47:55 - 00:48:03]** This seems like a nice-to-have and not a need-to-have at the moment, but I'm happy to do it literally when everyone else is done.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** So I can make my escape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** Just before.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:12]** Doctor, okay, hearing sort of the stuff from... Sorry.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** Do you want to roll a sense motive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:14]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:18]** What if Orvier is the dad from the flashback scenes?

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:22]** Wasn't that guy like a Scottish accent or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** He had a northern English accent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:27]** Yeah, that's what I meant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** How is that not Scottish?

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** It's a little different.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:34]** I mean, I get that Scotland is not England.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:35]** It's very close.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:37]** And please forgive me, Scottish listeners.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:38]** I know.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:40]** We have now integrated a fifth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:44]** We can't lose another country or state.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:48]** I rolled a two for a total of 11 on a sense model.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:54]** I mean, he seems like he is – I would like to do the same with a 19.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:55]** That's fine.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:59]** Both of you seem like he is fine to undergo hypnosis.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:02]** He literally just wants other people who are injured to be seen first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:05]** Let me just interrupt.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:18]** I don't mind to look at people's injuries quickly while Cullen here takes over some of the more mental well-being issues.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:23]** so to speak, given the nature of what's happened here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:25]** Doctor, that's a great idea.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:30]** Let's set up a system where you step in and handle the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:36]** I'll be in the first room or the further room down the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** I'll step out.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:49]** This medbay appears to be well stocked for medical need and I'll step into the next room for mental need.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** All right.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** I'll follow you.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** Go on.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** And Dr. K steps in.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:59]** Start working through patients.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** Yeah.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:02]** Taking a look at them, seeing how they're doing.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** Yeah.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** And okay.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** We're writing a medical practice.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** Yeah.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:16]** First, it's... They all kind of line up.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:19]** O'Connor's and Eden Brand, medical doctors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:24]** And as they come out, they go, they see... I'm not a medical doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:29]** I'm more of a... Biologist or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:31]** Yeah, researcher.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** I love how this looks.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:37]** Everybody's like, all the people that just woke up are lined up along the wall, waiting to see Dr. Okay and then Colin.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:41]** And as they step out of the two of them, it's an okay for Rick to give them back their weapons.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:46]** As he's pulling them out from underneath the chair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:52]** It feels like all over with each, uh, with each patient you see Dr. Okay.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:57]** Like scraping some cells off the, off the skin for research purposes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:05]** I mean, I can attune chemicalizing to, I think up to five people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** Okay.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:13]** So Dr. K, you see the peritons, Orvier starts to do a hypnosis with you, Colin.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** Yeah.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:19]** And sits on the bed and you start working through people.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:23]** You guys have a good rotation going before you see everybody.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:32]** What you get from Orvier's hypnosis, I'll just say that now that things are calm and that you've done it, you're more practiced.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:35]** You're able to consistently get them in.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:39]** Maybe one of them has a bit of a like Torv.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:46]** You don't redo Torv or Orgat, but everyone does have a strange thing about them.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:51]** Maybe they're missing a nail entirely, just been pulled from a nail bed.

**[00:51:51 - 00:52:01]** Maybe there's a part where part of their nose has just been severed, cut in two, but then stitched back together, but hanging separately.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:07]** There's all these weird little things that have been taken from each of them.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:12]** Their hypnosis reveals all the same information that you knew before.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:22]** Orvier has a similar experience as Shay, where everything... It seemed like it was... Everything was dark.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** It seemed like there was a punishment.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:26]** Yeah.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:34]** Doesn't remember much else besides that, except then finding out that there must be, you know, something going on.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:40]** Gnarla's call to say, hey, we're going to keep an eye out for greys that are on board.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** There is a grey ship.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** We're going to pull a maneuver.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:45]** And Orphear was like, you know what?

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** I also need to do some dishes.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:59]** and uh like just like put on the armor and was like well i'm i'm waiting to see what happens and starts doing it and then just collapses i mean i i wash my dishes with chloroform that makes sense

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:04]** And then passes out while washing dishes with chloroform.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:19]** Everyone else has a similar experience that Torv and Orgat had where they had an experiment, then were brought into a room, were told that you all were traitors, that you were dangerous, and that they needed to take you out.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** Well, she is.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:27]** So that maybe takes the better part of probably an hour to two hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:47]** So during this whole period, Colin is writing notes in his medical journal about each of the interactions he's having with each of the Pikes Puritans and also the commonalities, just as a medical researcher would for further dissemination to his band.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:48 - 00:54:02]** Rick has no help in this case, but as a player, I want to be able to help distinguish information and be like, wait a minute, there's these common threads between the three characters that didn't become violent.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:05]** There's got to be something that we can roll for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:11]** Well, I think what Colin is probably hungry for is a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:16]** It's still the middle of the first night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:20]** I was thinking like all the people who were passed out technically got short rests, right?

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** They all got their stamina back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** I'll help investigate that.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:27]** That's a really good point on Kevin's part.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:30]** We should maybe see if there is something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** I'll start.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:34]** Can I do a perception check on everyone in the hall?

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** Just if anybody's doing something weird.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:38]** I guess that would be more of a sense motive, huh?

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** I don't know if I have sense motive.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** You might.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:45]** I do have sense motive with zero.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:46]** Okay.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** So I'll start with perception.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** I'm just going to do perception.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:55]** 13 plus 7 for 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** Yeah.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** Everyone seems tired and beat up.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:01]** You can tell that Orvier is projecting a lot of energy.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:09]** Seems like he is moving slower, but trying to get energy and be an example.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:10]** The time.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:13]** Playing the part of a leader.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:17]** Cool.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:17]** So...

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:22]** Dr. K, Colin, Rick, you are handing weapons back.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:29]** Here's as Orgat walks up and says, Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** All right.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** I see you have, I think, my armor.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** Oh, hey, Orgat.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:39]** Thanks for your help, by the way, with this whole thing.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:45]** I don't know that we would have gotten out of this situation without you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:49]** I mean, sometimes it takes a situation to resolve a situation, so I get it.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:54]** I'm really appreciative of you giving me your armor, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:54 - 00:56:02]** I didn't give you the armor, but I would like your back if you could just drop it at my room next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:05]** I'll do that next time.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:06]** Definitely.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:11]** I just need to make sure that the ship is safe.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** You know what I mean?

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:16]** So I need it on for a little bit more, and I'll


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:18]** Why don't you give me my armor back tomorrow?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:21]** Well, you... You want to get breakfast?

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** We should have breakfast.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** Oh, okay, yeah.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** We could be friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** We could talk about this a bit more.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:31]** Yeah, so bring the armor tomorrow, and we'll have some breakfast.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** What do we have?

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** Well, I mean, whatever's there.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:41]** But if you'd like something special, I do know how to make some, you know, well, some Eoxian specialties, actually.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:41]** Oh, such as?

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:45]** Well, I mean, they have a certain tongue dish that is a delicacy.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** I'll have to talk to...

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:54]** Or if your darling CFA have that, but we could synthesize something that's not as good, but we could actually do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:57]** Aren't those the zombies?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:00]** Yeah, that's the planet where they determined how to live.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:04]** If you want to know more, you got to ask more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:09]** Anyway, look, I'm pretty tired, but I'll see you at breakfast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:13]** Are you eating a steady diet of Aoxian?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:19]** Sorry, is Dr. Okay talking to me from across the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:23]** I just overheard that, and I didn't hear you disclose it in your medical history.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:31]** Well, I grew up quite young, so I mean, I have had a fair bit of delicacy for that, but if you need to... That is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:33]** Rick goes, she tried to eat my face.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:37]** Oh, goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** Oh, I'm so sorry.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:42]** Yeah, that's just one of my specialties.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:44]** I am so sorry about that.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:46]** I hope it wasn't too terrifying.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** It was pretty scary, though, right?

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** Yeah, I worked on it a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** It was very frightening, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** Okay, okay, right, yeah.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** But again, I'm so sorry.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** I'm glad that you are not hurt.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** That warms my heart that you're not hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:59]** Let's get breakfast tomorrow or God.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** I'm glad you're feeling better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:01]** I would love that.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** Thank you.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:02]** Yeah.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** All right.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:03]** Keep my armor safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:09]** I don't know what's going on, but I'm going to roll with it.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:11]** It was not a forward wing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:11]** Keep your shape.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:12]** Yeah.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** She's just being friendly.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:13]** All right.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:14]** Thanks.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:16]** Okay.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:16]** You're taken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:20]** We don't want to talk about it yet, but sure.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:28]** I wrote a background story to you, John, like three years ago.
