**[00:00:28 - 00:00:34]** Or will they be crying into the void like Ripley in a Ridley Scott film?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** It's like in the camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:36]** I think if you just reach up, just put your finger right in front of the camera out of focus and just constantly move it.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** And I think that's perfect.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Yeah, that's great.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:39]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** That won't change.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:36]** So, like, I find it funny, rather, when I look at a group of friends, usually there's, like, one or two facial hair traits that, like, the entire group subscribes to.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** We are all five of us completely different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:39]** Not completely.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:03]** Him and TC are just flying around.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Hey TC, let's get the chopper.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:12]** Yep.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** Kev's got the goatee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:17]** Kevin to me looks like a musketeer.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:20]** I like it.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** You're the beautiful D'Artagnan of the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** You could be in a Dutch painting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:27]** He's a slightly less pointy Captain Morgan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:29]** I'm working on it.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** Give me a couple months.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:33]** He does look very piratey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:35]** He does look piratey.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:35]** I like you, man.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:40]** Will's got this really glorious full chin strap goatee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:42]** I'm sorry for comparing myself to you, Will.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** You're right.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:45]** Yours is much more glorious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** It's two-tone as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:50]** Yeah, it's multi-toned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** It's stately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:53]** Ah, stately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** He looks like a statesman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** Yeah.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** Pirate gentleman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:00]** I got in a fight with my, uh, my beard trimmer today.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:08]** And so I'm like almost five o'clock shadow chin straps, some, some tight, tight, uh, tight mustache work.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:27]** i like the mustache i honestly like the tight mustache i think it works for you i think so i really do i i like the type i just knocked it down too far it's okay i grabbed the wrong guard i grabbed the same guard i usually use after i shower and it it like stays thicker but doing it dry it's just like once you start yeah you gotta finish


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** You got to finish.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:31]** I mean, I think now, Benny, you're at a point where you can choose your fighter, right?

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** Like, which hairstyle are you going with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:35]** I know.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:38]** Which of the four of you do I want to bite off of the most?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:45]** And with that, I think it's time to introduce this beautiful cast that we have.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:45]** Right here.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:48]** So, I want to get a little introduction from you.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:57]** Who you are, who your character is that you're playing, and also why we should vote for you for our senior class high school president.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** Kevin, go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** Hi, everyone.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** My name is Kevin Decker.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:08]** I am hailing from Maryland, Baltimore area.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:14]** I am 36 years old, and I don't like walks on the beach.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** Wow.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** What do you have against the beach?

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:17]** Yeah.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:18]** Yeah.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** What's wrong with the beach, man?

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** I guess the beach in Maryland is kind of meh.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** Did the beach kill your family?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** I'm pale skinned.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** We've had this conversation before.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:27]** I don't like the sun.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:31]** I'm playing the Android Rick 19.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:40]** And the reason that I should be your class president is because I will listen to your voices and amplify them to those who need to hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:41 - 00:07:10]** super political that was good yeah that was like pleasing yeah took the question seriously your time near DC has done you well who is next Kev you pick Kelly alright what are we talking about again okay my name is Kelly like Kevin I'm not in the sun too much usually but I do like the beach it's very nice

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** What was the other stuff we were talking about?

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:14]** Oh, why would I be your class president?

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:16]** Wait, also, who are you playing?

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:21]** Okay, so in Threefold Conspiracy, I play, here's Fabricius.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:26]** He's a former pirate, Shirin Technomancer.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:53]** um yeah and uh why i should be your class president is because the current class president is full of lies lies and slander and and he's dishonest and he he provides very political answers like kevin does and you shouldn't vote for kevin you need someone like fresh and new who says it like it is and that's me no no you're just like him though it's the same thing who's the incumbent i think rolu's the incumbent

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:56]** Oh, well, you know you can't trust Rolu, everyone, right?

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:58]** So, like, I'm just telling you.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:00]** I mean, the way Kelly is talking about him.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** We're backpedaling.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** Oh, wait, I'm here now.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** Oh, f***.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** You can totally trust Rolu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:10]** Like, Rolu is, like, the best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:14]** He's the kind of guy you want on your crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:20]** He's a faithful friend who will deliver rare items to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** Exactly.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:21]** Yeah.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** Save the universe.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** Probably.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:29]** Well, thank you for taking off your Thaddeus cap, putting your hair cap on.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:31]** It's hard to do.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** I gotta, I gotta put it down.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:33]** Yeah.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** Kelly, who is next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:37]** Let's have Vinny go next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** I want to hear Vinny.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:40]** I'm Vinny.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:45]** I play a character we just met eight minutes ago called Colin Edenbrand.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:54]** He's a lovely healing mystic, and I'm really excited to get to know him again.

**[00:08:56 - 00:09:01]** I would make a great senior class... I would actually make a terrible senior class president.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** Um...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** And I think that's precisely why you should vote for me.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:13]** I think I am absolutely transparent in what I'm good at and what I'm not good at.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:21]** And I'm a great ideas guy and would come up with a whole lot of ways that my successors could make this institution better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:26]** I mean, it is the job of the president to be more of an ideas guy, really, ultimately.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** So, yeah, it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:28]** Yeah.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** I also really like drinking on the beach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:40]** I feel like there's some strong Maximus Decimus Meridius vibes with you being like, I am not, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:45]** Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance in this life or the next.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:48]** That's why I should be your senior class president.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** No, so like,

**[00:09:50 - 00:10:15]** i got sunburned so bad like i'm like peeling yeah my life wait it's my entire life i've never peeled there before like is this just what happens when you get old or am i turning into kevin yeah you're i i rubbed off on you that one time we met now you have yes literally rubbed off that's it yeah yeah did you did you like chest bump each other it's like don't do that kevin did oh really oh we did

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:17]** But shirts were on, though.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:20]** I thought if you chest bump shirts off, that's when things transfer.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** I would be surprised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:24]** For all the audio listeners, when Benny was talking about that, Benny did lift up his shirt.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:29]** So I think we're in a new class of video on Twitch and on YouTube.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** Because Benny just showed some skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:32]** We definitely need to put a warning on this video.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:38]** Yeah, just pixelize when you pull up your shirt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** Pixelate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:43]** Pixelate.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** So you can't see it.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** Love it.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:52]** Only on our OnlyFans can you see that he lift up his shirt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** You gotta pay for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:57]** OnlySaves.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** And I guess I'll tap Will because he's the last one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** John has to go too.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** Don't forget.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Oh, does John have to go?

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** I already said who I was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** But I'll go.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:11]** John doesn't have to go because he already introduced himself and I shall introduce myself now.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** I am Will.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** I am... No relation.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:19]** No relation to the podcast.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:19]** Truly.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:26]** I play Dr. Contu Okatis, a Osharu biohacker.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:37]** Very interesting character who also has a briefcase bot called Bernice, a sage drone, because I'm also one level mechanic.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:49]** I would make a excellent class president because I bring a stately wisdom to this office that is unmatched by my competitors here.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:52]** And yeah, that's why I should be picked.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:56]** But that's my I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** Wow.

**[00:11:56 - 00:12:14]** bravo amazing she's sort of ron swanson the office though i feel like giving your point of view i think in your proclivities i feel like you just destroy from the inside out on purpose i would have the most efficient and lean office this high school has ever seen


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:24]** I did once successfully lead a boycott in my grade school cafeteria lunch to get healthier lunches one time, which was funny.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:24]** That's awesome.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:27]** That was back in like the 90s when nobody cared about nutrition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** See, that's right.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:30]** You're a trendsetter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** Yeah.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** It's like a slap of pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** Yeah.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** You remember the food pyramid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:37]** Yeah, I remember that.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:38]** You broke that down?

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** Yeah, wow.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:40]** You're crazy.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** I mean, I think in 1999...

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** There was no nutrition in 2000.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:46]** At all?

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:47]** Immediately.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** Y2K.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:48]** It didn't exist?

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** Boom.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** Sugar wasn't real?

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:50]** No.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:50]** No.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** It wasn't at all.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:54]** John, why do you want to be class president?

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** I already am.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:55]** It's cool.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:58]** I'm the GM for right now, so it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** It's all good.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:01]** Because Kelly is ranting against me, I'm pretty sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:05]** Well, I mean, I think we let the audience decide, you know?

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** I think they need to write in.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** First poll of book three.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:09]** Let us know.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** Let us know.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** Cool.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** Let's jump in.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:15]** Let's do a little page turn here.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** Start to move into the story.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:27]** I'm thinking maybe we talk not just about your characters, but at the end of book two, which we'll get to how we got there in a bit.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:32]** At the end of it, there was a level up.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:37]** Does anyone want to share?

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** My hands moved up really slowly.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** I was watching my screen.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:39]** It was like this.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:43]** Does anyone want to share at all?

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** what changed in their level up.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:47]** No?

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:47]** Kev?

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** Kev says no.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** Kev wants to keep it a secret.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** Kev is shaking his head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:56]** Soldiers aren't that... I know the pain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** It's all with the soldier.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:01]** I just got done playing Thaddeus, as some people know.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:08]** It's always just like, ooh, you can hit another person 1% of the time when something happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** I do get a new style of hitting people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** It's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:15]** Hitting the bots where they hurt.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** Or not bots.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** From a bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:24]** I'll share one bit of mine that I shamelessly stole from Rolu.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:33]** I really liked his spell to push people into their future and just wither them away.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:37]** Turns out that is also available to Mystics.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:39]** Nice!

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:39]** Cool!

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:41]** It's a creepy spell.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** Oh, it's super creepy.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:45]** I can't wait to describe someone's dying days to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** All right.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** I'm just going to pen that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:48]** Good lord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** That's dark.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** I have to figure out something for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:55]** It's like grave words before death, and then there's grave words afterwards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** And then afterwards, you cast grave words.

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** Okay.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** Okay.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:03]** Wait, so you have grave words?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** No.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:07]** No, I have, scrolling down, days weariness.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** Okay.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** There it is.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:10]** It's pretty cool.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:11]** Pretty cool.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** Yeah.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:12]** It's dope.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:21]** Well, Dr. I guess, I guess I'll go, uh, as your future class president, I'll take the initiative.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:25]** Um, so I, um, I got a new spell called our artificial geyser.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** Okay.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:30]** After playing Thaddeus and after just like not hitting two thirds of the time, got really annoyed.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:38]** So I just wanted to like, I think what with here is I'm just going to like pour a bunch of shit into him that like makes him hit a lot, like magic missile, uh,

**[00:15:38 - 00:16:05]** overheating an artificial geyser and you create a burst of pressurized boiling water it deals 3d8 slashing and fire damage uh and applies the burn condition for 1d6 to each character in the area and uh a successful reflex save has damage but it always does uh cause damage which is awesome so yeah yeah i'm gonna make here's my little glass cannon i see i see what you're doing there you're you're just always gonna hit so i need to change the enemy's hp i

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:10]** I don't, I, I, before I said this, I was thinking, should I say it?

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:15]** Because I don't want John to, yeah, like to nerf it later.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** All right.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:16]** This is what I want.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** I want, here's to stay alive.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:18]** Okay.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** For story reasons.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:20]** Sure.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:23]** And then like, also, uh, don't, don't change your enemy styles.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:28]** Don't be like a Kevin and like add a bunch of out of nowhere.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:28]** Don't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** Or K'fax!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:30]** No.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** Oh, it's hot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** Because we don't give a K'fax.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** Yeah.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:35]** That's cool.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:35]** That's cool.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:37]** That's cool.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** I definitely won't change the enemy's HP.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** Will, anything you want to share?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:42]** Not really.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:44]** Okay.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:45]** Will, the man of mystery.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:46]** Yeah.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:50]** My stately wisdom is telling me to just keep my mouth shut.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:52]** Oh, you do have to trust that.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** You do have to trust that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** It's probably wise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** I don't want to give...

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:00]** as was stated by my, you know, respectable colleague.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:02]** However, we disagree.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:10]** Uh, you know, I don't want to give John any, any, any, uh, inkling into what I might be doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:16]** This is why I never share my HP with John or any GM ever.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** Like, uh, you know, it's there.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:21]** It makes cheating that much tabletop.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:21]** Okay.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** Now that we're using foundry.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:24]** Yeah.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:24]** It's there.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** So yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:27]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:31]** Your Foundry is not... Plus, I guess he could look on Hero Lab.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:34]** Unless you're using Foundry, I have not put in your stats on Foundry.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:38]** Because my understanding is that we're still using Hero Lab.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** Yeah, I'm still using Hero Lab.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** But you can see Hero Lab.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** I can't.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** I can't.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** It's not really a secret.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:47]** But I try to play by the rules, so I usually don't.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Except in extreme circumstances.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** I'm a level zero on Foundry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:57]** When you buy a Formian Venom caster at level 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:04]** And you have to go in and make sure that all the things that you bought are actually above 40.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:07]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:09]** I did just pull it out in the middle of combat.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** Like, here we go.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** Yes, you did.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:14]** It was great.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** Good times.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:15]** Good times.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** I forget everything I said, John.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:18]** Never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** Yeah, no, for sure.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:21]** I am forgetting as we speak.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** So, a couple things.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:28]** One, I think we should play.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** Okay.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:32]** Yeah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** Here we go!

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** A couple things to say.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:41]** One, is that I want to make sure... I've turned off the music for this because this is very serious.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** This is very important.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** I want to make sure that everyone knows...

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:51]** who is listening and watching and everyone that is here, everyone knows the muffin man, the cast.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** Thank you.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** It's very clear.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** Thank you for sponsorship from the muffin man.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** Our only sponsor.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:05]** What I actually want to say is kind of weird, but well, you know, I mean, you take what you can get before we continue.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:10]** I do want to say we are not playing a lighthearted story.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:18]** So there may be content or scenes or circumstances or events in this book.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:25]** and throughout this adventure path that may involve some things that you might find to be disturbing.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:35]** So that might include some sort of like body horror or psychological horror or emotional manipulation, trauma, otherwise things that could be triggering.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:39]** And I think it's important that you know that that content might show up.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:45]** And if you've listened to the show, you know that we tend to blend humor and drama.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:50]** and we don't always lean on it, but nonetheless, there could be content that is disturbing.

**[00:19:50 - 00:20:01]** So I have told you four before in our session 0.3, that if there is anything that is hurtful or damaging or triggering in any way, obviously,

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:03]** If you know something beforehand, let me know.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:09]** And if it's happening live while we're recording, then you can message me.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:15]** And also, if we are in game, there is going to be an X card on Foundry.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** I appreciate that module.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:19]** I believe somebody just brought it up now that we have.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** It means we need to stop right here.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:23]** We're going to take a break.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:26]** Maybe we'll go to commercial or maybe we will do whatever we need to do in order to move through it.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:55]** and make sure that we're moving forward in a healthy way because we want everyone to be at the table we want everyone to have a good time we want everybody to feel like they are welcome and also we want to be aware that some things that may be okay with some people's boundaries are not okay with others that's it just want to recognize that now i'm going to bring you over to our splash screen and foundry while i queue up the music because we're going to do a recap whoa


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:56 - 00:21:01]** So the splash screen's coming in and it's got a loading button and it's all digitized.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** Colin.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** What is that?

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:07]** Showing like microscopic images.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** Yeah.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** There's a lot happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:10]** 44%.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:10]** 48%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** There's a lot going on here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** There's a lot going on here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** This is good work, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:18]** Thanks.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** This is dope.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Tom quality.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:23]** I am glad that you guys like it.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:25]** Good thing that we got Adobe.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** That's what that's all about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:33]** So 51% still loading, loading, loading.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:46]** This recap last week, you might've heard the incredible recap from the four of you talking on the void crier late at night, catching call and Eden brand up on what happened.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:50]** If you haven't checked that out, you should, because that was awesome.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:59]** But if you have, I'm still going to give a recap that is a little more, let's call it thorough.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:09]** And I want to say that if you haven't gone back and listened, if this is all new to you, if you've gotten through the first 15 or 20 minutes of this and you're like, this is my first time listening, thank you.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** That's awesome.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Or watching.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** That's great.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:23]** I would highly encourage you to go back and listen to our podcast from episode one and then through book one and book two and then through Unknown Treasures because I think that's the best way that you're going to get this story.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** That's how you get involved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** Did you say our recap wasn't thorough?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:33]** Question is, is it as thorough as actually listening to you playing?

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** Then you miss out on the jokes.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** You miss out on knowing who the real murder bot is.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:41]** You miss out on knowing about Thaddeus.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:41]** Rex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** It's not Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:43 - 00:23:06]** well you miss out on finding out some some backstory that may come up you know like i do recommend that like for certain characters like rolu's story is interesting and so if you you can compare and contrast like how he is in threefold versus unknown treasures and stuff there's some good things you can see by getting through our catalog proper but yeah you can start here and go back if you need to yeah

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** Highly encouraging.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:12]** At some point in the future, people will be arguing about what is the proper way to listen to our show.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:17]** If it's chronological based off of in-game timeline or if they should do it based off of time of release.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** That'd be cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:26]** We should say if you want to do it in timeline purposes, Unknown Treasures is first.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** Then book one and two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:32]** Then book three.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:34]** Our story began...

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:42]** When we were introduced to Rick 19, our android soldier fighting for a cause.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:48]** Dr. Contu Okatis, our biohacker searching for his lost mentor.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:53]** Here's Fabricius, our Sheeran technomancer on the run.

**[00:23:53 - 00:24:00]** And Nico Orion, our human, a son without a family.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:04]** And what began as a simple journey.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** Spoiler.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:14]** Through the drift, aboard the Chimera, encountered trouble as the ship's drift drive began to malfunction.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:26]** This strange event led to another trail of events that began to follow you as you begin to also explore the disappearance of a security officer.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** Algiadayom.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:40]** as well as then prevent a hostile takeover of the ship by Jyn Chiroga, the vicious Barghest and Goblin crew.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:51]** And then you eventually begin to unravel a plot to take over control of the Chimera by a pirate group called

**[00:24:52 - 00:25:05]** of astrozoans, these shape-shifting beings who killed and impersonated the captain and eventually Algiada and U-4, well, U-3.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:14]** At the apex of the mystery, about to apprehend the pirates, the crew members' eyes roll back in their head as explosions rock the ship.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:19]** You rush to an emergency pod only to discover...

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:23]** That everything that you thought you knew about where you were was wrong.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:29]** And the ship is not in space, but is located in a vast chamber.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:31]** Maybe a simulation.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:40]** You are blasted, rocketed off into the darkness with no way to control your destination.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:43]** And again, more questions than answers.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:44]** That was book one.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** That was a lot.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:46]** That was a lot.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:48]** I'm going to pause there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:51]** I think we covered all of that in our recap.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** I didn't hear what you said there, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** What was that again?

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:57]** I think we covered all of that in our recap.

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:04]** I'm really offended by that saying ours wasn't... Kev did do the recap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:04]** Is that why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:07]** Yeah, I think it's important to still do a recap here.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** It's okay.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:13]** You can just... You call me not thorough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:15]** I can't say not thorough.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:18]** I think you can just brush some of the salt off the episode here.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:20]** You're throwing a lot of salt down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:24]** But it's like over communication is better than under communication.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** I don't know.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:28]** We just want to be very thorough here too.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** I understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** All right.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:34]** I feel like we're on the edge of a ramp up, but I'll just let it go.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:34]** I know.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** It would have been good, but we should keep going.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** It would have been really good.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:37]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** Cool.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:42]** So you begin book two with a need for answers.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** Where are you?

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** What are you doing?

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:48]** What happened to everybody on the Chimera?

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:56]** And you've landed in a room designed to receive the emergency pods in some sort of probably scientific facility.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** And you begin exploring.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:01]** You begin looking through dungeon crawl style room by room.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:05]** You discover a room with dead greys in control of several experiments.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:11]** You meet one alive who wants to use your brains as resources for a computer.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:14]** And keep in mind, greys are like...

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** Top conspiracy number one.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** No one sees greys.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:30]** And in this world, the fact that you have seen a grey and that there's information that is unexplored to this extent in the world of Starfinder is pretty huge.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:35]** Several runes and a difficult fight with a gray bounder later, you begin hearing this mysterious pinging.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:41]** And then you're ambushed by three dinosaurs from a flash of green light.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** Three flashes.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:48]** And sadly, one of them kills your compatriot, Nico Orion.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** Such a stressful fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:51]** It was stressful.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** It just kept coming over and over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:54]** Yeah.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** The diamond dogs, the dinosaurs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** Everything coming out of green orbs.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:02]** We never knew how many were there and how many were going to come later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** Or where they'll come out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:07]** The worst.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:09]** You move on.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:32]** with your grief and everything there and the hardship of that fight to discover the source of the pinging, that there's a comms that is receiving the message from a stewardship that has infiltrated the base and needs your help in order to escape for you to escape and for them to escape.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:39]** So you must shut down or halt a reactor meltdown before it is too late to

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:55]** Now, you go looking for this reactor, and once you finally find the way, you discover a secret passage, and then you discover this trapped gladiator named Frog, clearly a subject of experiments by the Greys.

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:09]** Frog warns of a troll who is likely looking and near the reactor, and who nearly killed Frog, who is an Akeshti Rivener, this massive, massive individual.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** So you begin your search.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:18]** And although you didn't quite find the troll right away, you do find someone paralyzed in the bushes.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:22]** Our very own Colin Edenbrand.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:22]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:24]** Colin Edenbrand.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:32]** So now you went from just being the three of you, Dr. OK, Hears, and Rick19, to having two new friends.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:34]** And you find the way down to the troll.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** And you begin the fight.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** And from the beginning, it is deadly.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** The troll is able to teleport.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** The troll has this massive reach.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:46]** There's fluxes of radiation.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** You're in this confined space.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:52]** It is a fierce and devastating combat.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:58]** And the troll eventually takes down Frog, his nemesis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:58]** R.I.P.?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** And Frog dies.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** So sad.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** So you go into Avenger mode.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:03]** Boom.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** You take out the troll.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** You shut down the reactor.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:10]** And you're like, let's blow this popsicle stand.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:13]** This is the worst popsicle stand I've ever been to.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** You go back up.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:19]** You know that you're supposed to go meet the stewards, but I will add that you divert them.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:21]** Play a little sneaky sneak.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:28]** And you make your way up to the docking bay where you find the stewards special op ship, the Void Crier.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** Gnarla comes down.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** You meet Gnarla and Shay face to face.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:38]** And you get on the ship on its way to the Steward's base.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:45]** And as you leave, as you pull out and you're looking at this asteroid...

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:58]** Then you all start to receive these messages or communique that detail something that's important to your characters.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** And you leveled up.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:04]** And if you're curious about what those things were, some of you revealed them.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:08]** It was a little drip by drip.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** And some of you decided to share with the listeners.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:10]** Some of you didn't.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:13]** Some of you said, hey, maybe if you message me, I'll tell you what it is.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** Does that offer still stand?

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:17]** Oh, definitely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:19]** I messaged each of them, and nobody answered me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** Wow.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:22]** Oh, is that?

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:23]** Okay.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:27]** I think I might have just blocked your account.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:27]** Yeah.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** Classic.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:28]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:29]** Weird.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Yeah, I don't know why.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** Yeah, this is crazy.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** That's crazy.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** Yeah, that's wild, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:40]** Mine was a message from the Android Evolution front, and all it said was, more information to come.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:42]** Hmm.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** Anybody else want to share this moment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** I mean, I will share.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:48]** Oh, wow.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** In character, but.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** In book three.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:51]** Or do you want to wait?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** I actually don't know where it is.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:56]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** I would share.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:59]** I forgot where you sent it.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:01]** I think I sent it to you in Discord.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:04]** In our Discord, in individual chat rooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:06]** In our Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:07]** Yeah.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** That's the Discord.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:11]** How long are you going to have to scroll back to find that one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:37]** no no this was only last week when i told him the other time that i lost it anyways yeah and then i gave it to you yeah it's cool nice i would share but i was under the impression that benny didn't want to hear like because you purposely didn't listen to that part of the episode i did which like if you want to share you can you can give me like a hand signal and i will turn my headphones all the way down so i can't hear it that's fine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:44]** I think that in this case, I probably want to share with the audience just because there's a connection to something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:47]** All right, I'll turn my headphones down.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** You guys...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** Do I have to turn my headphones down?

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** It's up to you, dude.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:54]** I'm going to listen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:57]** I love this thing that y'all did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:02]** So what Hears got was he got a transmission from Rulu.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:07]** And timeline-wise, it happened right after the events of Unknown Treasures.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:16]** When, spoiler alert, he takes off into the stars to meet the... What are they called again?


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** The veil.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** The veil.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** Yeah.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:25]** He transmits a message to here is like telling him that he has something for him and that he's going to meet him.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:31]** Uh, and then that's what here's gets at this, at this part of book, uh, at the end of book two.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:31]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:38]** Is it the audio that Rolu recorded at the end of Unknown Treasures?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:40]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:40]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:44]** And that is where that leads up to.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:45]** Sorry.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:53]** Basically, that's where like here's the message is regarding like here's and Rolu's meetup at the beginning of book one, right, John?

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** Or another meetup.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:58]** Because like I was going to say, otherwise you got that transmission late.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** Or John's not going to tell me.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** Ooh.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** All right, cool.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** So John's not telling me.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:06]** Anyway, it's, it's the message that was like transmitted after UT.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:07]** That's all.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:08]** Yeah.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:08]** Done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:16]** It just, it's, it sucks for the listener because like John's poker face, you can't see it, but he just looks straight at the camera blankly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:19]** Maybe I have a theory about what it is.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:26]** I have a feeling like if this is another meeting in the future, I think I know what's going on, but I don't want to say, I was just a guess.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:27]** So.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:29]** Well, Rolo was a precog, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** He would know.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:32]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** You can come back, Vinny.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** Vinny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:38]** Vinny, we are beckoning you in to come back in.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** Yes.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** You can put the headphone jack.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:41]** Click.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** He puts it back in.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** Yeah.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:44]** He puts it back in.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:45]** In the basket.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:49]** And immediately Black Sabbath starts to play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:51 - 00:35:17]** yeah i was thinking that too all right anybody else want to say anything no yes gonna hit me up on discord i'll tell you okay i mean are we are we where are we on the ship are we like in quarters i haven't even gotten there yet so i wanted to do it yeah then let me continue and there and there will be that moment


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:31]** So, after these communique come in, then the asteroid blows up, first with typical colors of explosion, and then with this green hue to the explosions.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:35]** Blows up to a point, and then reverses in on itself.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:39]** Hopefully that sounded cooler than it did in my head.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:42]** And vanishes into a bright green flash of light.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:46]** Big bada-boom, and then it was a move.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** Bing bada boom.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Boom bada bing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:51]** Oh, move.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** I get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:52]** Nice.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** And then a move.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:54]** Sorry.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** It's Moog.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** It's Moog.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** It's not.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:58]** It's Moog.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Moog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** Moog.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:03]** It's Moog.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:03]** Moog.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:04]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:05]** What is?

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** I don't get this.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:07]** It's cool.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** It's a company.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:10]** And so we returned.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:13]** To our survivors.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:21]** I think you all are survivors who have escaped a house of space horrors called Outpost Omicron.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** We're thrivers.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** You're thrivers.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:26]** Tell me more about that in the episode.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:29]** There has to be a lot of internal trauma and feelings you guys are going through.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:30]** Are you thriving?

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** Are you surviving?

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** How is it feeling?

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:36]** Let's jump back to...

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:52]** The bridge of the Void Crier, where finally, after two books, two books, finally, you are about to enter the drift.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:53]** And we ended.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:55]** Loading the Void Crier.

**[00:36:56 - 00:37:00]** With Gnarla saying, well, that's that.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:04]** Let's get the fuck out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:07]** Ezra, punch it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:20]** And there is a multicolored rainbow slice of space that you see on the view screen that begins to unravel and is cut in front of you, right in front of the bow of the ship.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:32]** And meters on the adjacent panels around you begin to slide upwards as all of these signals are being detected as the signature double-tone hum of...

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:48]** of a drift drive cascades through the floors and the walls and you can feel it and hear it and the cosmic color drift almost begins to spill out of this planar gash as the void crier

**[00:37:48 - 00:38:17]** starts to rocket forward and your grip on the seat or station where you're standing there on the bridge with narla and shay and three other individuals your grip tightens against the g forces as you begin to move forward there's a final brief stop right near the barrier almost like a tug on the ship and then you slide through the barrier between the material plane and the drift

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:35]** There are these multicolored hues that fill out the viewport and paint colors across the floor of the bridge like light through a stained glass window.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:45]** The drift begins to darken once you move past that barrier, begins to darken as your eyes adjust and you leave the entrance behind.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:55]** Perhaps Dr. OK, I was thinking about this, perhaps Dr. OK and Hears and Rick, maybe you see colors that Colin's human eye wouldn't see, right?

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:58]** Like your tetrachromats, like you are seeing some things.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:02]** Colin is seeing a kaleidoscope.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** And you're seeing even more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:06]** I'm seeing things that I can't even describe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** Here's this like, ah, Rolly.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** Rolly would love to paint something like this.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:14]** Actually, second thought, maybe not.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:17]** There's not enough stars in it, but I feel like he'd still enjoy it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:21]** Is this an ordinary description of the drift?

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:28]** Okay, so it's not like we're seeing something new then if we've entered Tribal before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:32]** You think back and you're like, this feels right.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** This feels like what we see.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:44]** You see that there is somebody who is sitting on, I'm going to ping them here on Foundry.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** Did you see that ping?

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:45]** Yep.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** This is the first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** Sweet.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:48]** Yeah.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:51]** So we're on the bridge of the Void Crier.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** It's a, what is it?

**[00:39:53 - 00:40:04]** 30 by 20 foot weird oval like shape it's like an egg yeah it's like an egg with a square bottom

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:20]** And there's a captain's seat right smack in the middle, and then you have four of Void Cry crew members sitting around the panels, and then all of us, the four of us plus Bernice, are kind of in the back of that area.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:28]** So you ping the front and to the right forward starboard crew member.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** A Kasathan.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:34]** Narla Yalamis is sitting in the captain's chair.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:37]** Shay is sitting in the furthest left.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:40]** Then there is a Lashunta sitting next to them to the right.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** Then a Kasathan sitting on the front right.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:51]** And then there is also a Yasoki who is sitting on the fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:54]** A gray-furred, purple-haired Yasoki.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** Yeah.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** They're fun.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** They're fun.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** You see the

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:03]** Uh, Cassathan actually.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:24]** Begin to take controls and start to dial in some auto navigation because in the drift in front of you, right, you're trying to avoid the spontaneous dislodged material plane debris, right?

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:30]** Because every time that you enter the drift, the theory is that you have pulled something out of the material plane into the drift as well.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:40]** So you see land, maybe see globules of water floating off, and you see buildings floating through this drift medium.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:47]** There's a sign that you can make out that reads, like, Leovara is for lovers, paid for by the Berthedon Travel Agency.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:49]** There's, like, an LED billboard.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:52]** You can see off to your right, there's a small Abadar Corp.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:57]** There's, like, a corner of what appears to be, like, a headquarters sign, but it's covered in this green goo.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** And you're like...

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** That's weird.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:04]** And then it starts to quickly move past you as the Kasathan is piloting forward.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:10]** Gnarla, Gnarla's voice interrupts your thinking.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:14]** Both you hear locally and over the intercom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:18]** Attention all crew.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:26]** It is roughly 1800 and we have now entered drift space.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:31]** and are currently on course to Varos.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:37]** Paragens or Veer will have your orders once we arrive.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:44]** Until then, you have the next five or so days to yourselves for free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:52]** Now, as lead for this operation, I do want to commend you all on a successful mission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:58]** We truly acted as a team, and that does not happen easily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:02]** It takes discipline, and it takes trust.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** And Weyden guided our way.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:10]** But our team is not without loss, however, and I don't know...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:27]** How other outfits that you've been with handle death, but we the stewards recognize its impact on all faiths, cultures, and those who remain behind.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:38]** So there will be a designated place and a separate designated time for an event to remember those who are not making this journey back with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:48]** Additionally, tonight at the event that I'm sure everyone is excited for, we will be sharing a toast in their honor.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:53]** Now, a few other things.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** Actually, one last thing.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:54]** Sorry.

**[00:43:55 - 00:44:00]** Finally, we have some looks at the four of you.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:06]** civilian guests with us, survivors rescued from the base.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:11]** They were integral and instrumental in making sure that everyone got out of there alive.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:15]** So, please, be friendly.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:20]** Be the cool people that you are, that I know all of you to be.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:25]** And if you're not, I won't need waiting to find out which one of you was rude.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:30]** Unless, of course, maybe one of the four of you is a red

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:49]** sonic fan right and then like maybe a few of the people sitting in front kind of chuckle that's all for now and then she turns to the four of you sorry do you not know who the red sonics are do you watch brutaris


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** I can't say I'm familiar.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:54]** Is it a racing group or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:57]** Yeah, I don't think we get that station on Pabek.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Oh, okay.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** Okay, well, that's a thing.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** That's fine.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** Well, Brutaris is a game.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** You should watch it.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:11]** Orvere and the Peritons, they are really into it.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Shay's also really into it.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** And Shay's about to say something.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** She's like, hold on, hold on, though.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:15]** Look...

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** we are about to be busy.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:19]** We are now underway on an operating ship.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:28]** So, uh, I do need the four of you to do your best to just relax, get to know everyone.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:32]** You'll get a chance to watch some Brutaris and relax.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:35]** Uh, Shay can show you the ropes.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:40]** Also brief you on Brutaris because, well, it's pretty popular.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:44]** So if you want to watch, if you're into sports, that's fine.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:45]** Now,

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:57]** If you can pry him away from this drone that he has, then he'll tell you even more about Brutaris.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:01]** I can't say that I'm super interested.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** I'm sorry.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** He doesn't actually say that out loud.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** I should say he's just thinking out of his head.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** Well, that was super rude of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** Hears, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** No, I'm totally into whatever sport that is.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** Oh, that's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:13]** Nice.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:14]** Okay.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** I'd love to check it out.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:17]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:17]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:21]** So, just so you know, like I said, they are the mercenaries.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:22]** That's Pyke's Peritons.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:25]** Orvir Pyke is their commander.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:25]** They're friendly enough.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:31]** Like I mentioned, they did lose two of their mercenaries on Omicron.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** One was wounded there in the Med Bay.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:41]** So, we'll get them patched up on Varos, but they're relaxing there, too.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** They're all nice.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** They're all great.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** They're all here, too, as well.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** They've been kind enough.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:48]** And you see the Kasathan turn around and wave.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:57]** And the Yosuke just lifts up both hands but doesn't look at you and does this move, trying to move both hands and waves.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:01]** And the purple hair moves back and forth.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:05]** The Lushenta just kind of nods off to the side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:08]** The Ahsoka, by the way, amazing look.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** It's cool art.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:10]** It's cool art.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** The purple hair.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** Incredible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** Are the Pikes, you said Pikes Periton?

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** Are they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** Pikes Peritons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:21]** Are they also stewards, or are they a separate mercenary group?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:25]** They are a mercenary group that we contract out with.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:30]** They tend to be one of the shortlist that we have set up to work with.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:37]** We have verified that they are safe to work on, let's call them sensitive missions, such as this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:40]** Copy that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** Interesting.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** Yes.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:44]** You can.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:48]** We do have some bunks for you on the lower deck.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:50]** There is food in the galley.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** You are welcome to move around.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:57]** Shay, can you take them down and just make yourselves at home?

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:00]** Anything else before you all leave the bridge?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:09]** May I speak with the galley chef in order to communicate some dietary restrictions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** Oh, sure.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:10]** Of course.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:13]** So we actually don't have a dedicated chef.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:18]** I think, honestly, Orvier does like to cook sometimes, but a lot of it is available.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** I mean, I can cook for myself.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** Sure, yeah.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:28]** And we'll put some things out, and I'll make sure just to note to the people who are organizing for any meals together, any family meals.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** Well, thank you so much.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** I'm more than happy to help.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:34]** Anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:42]** Captain, I want to thank you very much for getting us off of that outpost prior to the explosion.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:49]** Everything that the stewards have done for us, we can't thank you enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** It is I who have to thank you as well.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:56]** Without the four of you, we would not also be able to get off.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** We are always happy.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** We are always here to help.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** Thank you.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** Rick, right?

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:02]** Rick19?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:03]** Yes, sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:04]** Yes.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** Thank you.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** And thank you for saying thank you.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** No one says thank you anymore.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** I appreciate that.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** That was very nice.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** That was very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** All right, let's go.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:20]** I really want to roll a sense motive on everybody here, but I know Rick wouldn't, so... I'll do that.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** Here's who's going to roll a sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** Here's who's going to roll a sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** On who?

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** On her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** It isn't her, is it?

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:28]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** Narla Yalamis.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** Narla Yalamis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:32]** Narla Yalamis.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** Or Yasoki.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** Or way too giddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:41]** So, Kelly, what did you get?

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** It's only a 14, though.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:46]** Yeah, I'm probably definitely going to need some assistance.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** I mean, I would roll.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** Sure.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:51]** Separately.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:52]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:57]** I don't think you can assist unless you guys are communicating that you're assisting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** Hey, what do you think she means?

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** She's like, very funny.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:02]** Hey, you think she's cool?

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:08]** I don't even know if a b***h can do this, but if he had eyelids, they would be really narrow right now.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** And they'd be looking into her soul.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** But are they horizontal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** Where it's just like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:37]** they're flies eyes so it's just like a thousand eyes it's like a lot of a million little islands just like you know narrow each little like excel or whatever yeah yeah yeah i rolled doctor okay 22 to detect deception what what do we what do we get separately john at a 14 and 22


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:47]** I mean, I would say that hears you seem like Gnarla is just talking as a captain would to wrap up and move things forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:51]** As a former captain, seems pretty in character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** Yeah.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:53]** Dr.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:58]** O.K., you can tell that she is a little...

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:14]** hurried like she's happy to talk and do her role but also she like has some things to do i don't think you detect any deception other than that the deception when you're talking to somebody who's busy and you can tell like there's a certain point where they're like okay like i i might maybe need to get going


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:40]** here so she's great she's like yeah yeah so that's crazy specifically i guess what i'm trying to detect would be like about uh the mercenaries that she mentioned because my like spidey sense yep you know kind of went off um i think you would need to talk to them they everything that she said about them being hired by the stewards seems to be true


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:47]** I will actually do a... Wow, the first rolls of book three are sense motive rolls.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:49]** That's not an indication of how things are going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:52]** We're right back in the paranormal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:54]** We are back in three-fold.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** That is for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:57]** I think it's going to be a culture check, right?

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:06]** But I do have a minus five DC for culture profession checks related to law enforcement or a current mark.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:10]** I feel like mercenaries would be a level of law enforcement, right?

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** Especially if we're into the stewards.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:16]** What are you trying to do?

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:19]** Just whether or not I recognize the name and if I know anything of them.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:22]** And I'm going to do a culture check on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** Of the Pykes Paratons?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** Wow, that's an absolute waste of time.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:28]** That's a four?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** Yeah.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:39]** You think, would the stewards put their short list of the contractors that they use for sensitive missions and things out in the InfoSphere?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** They don't want to get their hands dirty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** Yeah.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:46]** That's probably what it was, actually.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:51]** He's running through his brain if he's ever heard of Pykes Paradon, and it doesn't show up.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:54]** And he's like, of course the stewards wouldn't post this.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** It makes sense that this is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:21]** yeah there would be a problem if you had heard of them right kevin's a professional killer would would correct i don't think that was the aspect i was that was yeah that was dead on kelly that was really good that was great he knows he knows what's up all right one day i'll escape this one day one day shay uh steps steps back pushes back stands up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:26]** All right, let's show you all a little bit around the ship.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** Do a quick tour.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:32]** By the way, the Peritons here that you know, they're great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** We got Hesper here.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** This is Hesper Valdez.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:36]** Points to the Lushinta again.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:36]** What's going on?

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:39]** She kind of does a slow, hello, hello.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:44]** And then we have Ezra right here.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** Points to the Kasothan.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** Just turns.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** Give me a pound.

**[00:53:49 - 00:54:08]** two arms come up and both pound lower and upper on your tentacle does your tentacle look like a fist when you do that or is it just the end of the tentacle that's wet yeah it's sort of like just this coiled slob gross

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:10]** One fist is enthusiastic.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:13]** The other one's a little tentative.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** Like, oh, okay.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:21]** And then Shay points to the Yosuke and says, and that's fetch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:24]** You're definitely my favorite guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** I like you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Well, thank you.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** That is just so nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** Thank you.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:31]** Do you have a septum piercing?

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:32]** Do I see?

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** One second.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:40]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:46]** So in Foundry right now, I'm going to see if I can do a neat module that I found where I do...

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** What am I missing?

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** You can't see it in Foundry?

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** You can't see it in Foundry?

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** Did it pop up?

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** Yeah, man.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:21]** It was like a dope little slide in.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:27]** For anyone listening, there's a nose piercing and three piercings in the left ear.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:30]** And there's probably some equivalent amount in the right.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:32]** There's one in the right.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:33]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:35]** Kind of looks like a rockabilly kind of aesthetic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:42]** Yeah, it's Yosuke with grayish hair and then a purple mohawk, all these piercings, and they have a popped collar on their uniform.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** Oh, they're so cool.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Purple and gray uniform.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** This is our new friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:46]** For sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:49]** Fetch sparkles go button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** Hey, Fetch.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:53]** Is it a he, a she, they?

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** What is Fetch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:58]** Fetch is pronounced, actually, she, her.

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** She, her.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:00]** Okay.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** Got it.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:06]** Hello, yes, I'm Hezbo Veldiz.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** This is the Lushinta.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** My pronouns are they, them.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** Thank you.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** And then just turns around.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:15]** Doesn't really want to talk to you too much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:17]** I like your saw that you got going on.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** Your electric saw, whatever that is.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:20]** It's a cool weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:23]** It is interesting that you carry that with you while piloting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:26]** Yeah, it's a little... I kind of get it, though.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:29]** I had a crewmate of mine once have one of those.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** They were really awesome.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:32]** Cut through flesh real quick.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Rick probably knows.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** Ask him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:47]** Actually, there's actually a strong case if you read some studies that using your weapon while actually sitting at the command console enhances your brain's ability to comprehend some of the information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** So thank you for that.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:55]** I would like to know this peer-reviewed BuzzFeed article that you're referring to.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** Sounds super legit.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:15]** sure i'll definitely find time in the next five days to send it to you yeah no i definitely will yeah just uh don't tell me your email and i'll ask it for i'll ask you for it later it's fine fax it to me you're comparatively boring to sparkles though so who's who's next


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** Oh, wow.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** It's fine.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** Bye.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:19]** Goodbye.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** So rude.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:23]** Yes, hi.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** I am Ezra.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:28]** Is there something that you want to ask me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:33]** Do you spend much time composing poetry?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:36]** No.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:40]** Ezra looks like they're out of Assassin's Creed for sure.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:45]** They got like four knives, one in each hand.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** Yeah, they're like a ninja mask.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** Oh, it's like a saw.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** Of course they do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:56]** You know, I'm happy to tell you about some of the finer details of the history of the ship.

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:01]** I was actually a Voidrunner, but I won't enthrall you right now.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:03]** I'll save that entertainment for later, if you'd like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:07]** Are you familiar with the ship's design, or this ship in particular?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:09]** You are asking the good question.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:11]** Sorry, what was your name again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:12]** I go by Rick.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:13]** Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:15]** Hello, Rick.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** I am Ezra.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:19]** So, you were asking about the ship.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:24]** Well, there are two schools of thought about the ship's design, really.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:27]** Which one would you like me to tell you about first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:34]** Would it be possible to get a breakdown of both so I can decide which would be the one I am most interested in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:37]** I see what your perspective is about this.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:43]** There are some things that I'm thinking about that might require my attention more before I can actually tell you about that.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:46]** Is there anything else that you want to know?

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:48]** I don't think I can give you that answer right now at this moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** No, thank you.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** I will return for those answers later.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** I appreciate your time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** I appreciate your time.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:02]** Is there anybody else who had a question before I pilot the ship continuously throughout the drift?

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:04]** Before sending it on autopilot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** All right, let's go.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** Shay just cuts off Ezra.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** So here's the thing about Foundry.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:13]** It's really cool.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:14]** I love it.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:19]** I also love that I have added in these elevator abilities.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:30]** So if you're looking on Foundry, you need to put your token into one of the four squares that is surrounding the small shield token, right?

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Oh, there it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:37]** Or being one of the four.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** Four.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:40]** Oh, there's like a turret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:40]** Oh, cool.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:43]** Can you take us and show us around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:44]** This is great.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:46]** Lower deck.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** No, so one sec.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:51]** Let me just show you through each thing here.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:59]** So if we go to the turret, then you need to be in one of the squares next to the shield and go ahead and jump.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** Super exciting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:06]** Yeah, this is just important to know that it's here.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:11]** There will be somebody who mans it, but in case you need to move to some safe space, this is the place that you can be.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:11]** So nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:15]** I am probably going to be the one to man this if needed.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** I am the best shot of our group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** We have people who have done this all their lives.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** They might do it before you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:21]** No offense, Rick.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:23]** I'm probably comparable to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** Is there going to be a kill?

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:28]** Don't doubt this bot's murder ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:30]** Do you want to have an arm wrestle about it?

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:31]** Or a shoot-off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:34]** I think they should get in a cage match.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** I think so, too.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:36]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:37]** All right.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** Hey, let's keep going.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:38]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:40]** So we're going to go down to the main deck.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:40]** All right.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** So there was the turret.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** This is fine.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** The turret looks very utilitarian.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:50]** Looks like it is a totally tactical space meant for literally doing one job, and that is to fire the guns.

**[01:00:50 - 01:01:01]** You move into the main deck, and as the elevator comes down, you see that there is off to your right, there are double doors that lead to probably the engine.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:04]** There seems to be a large flashing blue light in there.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:10]** And then to the left, you see a small little lounge area, a couple chairs.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** There are two figures there.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:14]** One is an orc.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** Is that an orc?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** Yes, I was going to say.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:16]** It's an orc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** Yeah, there is a half-orc.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:18]** Oh, my God.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:18]** Sorry.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:20]** There is a half-orc here.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:20]** Oh, okay.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:27]** And then next to that half-orc, the half-orc is just sitting, reading, looks over at you, smiles, and looks back.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:31]** And next to that half-orc seems to be this squat red robot.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:39]** And as soon as the elevator comes down, the robot turns to Shay and goes, I will save you, citizen!

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** And then walks over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:42]** It's like a Fallout robot.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** It's just like really, really weird AI.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:44]** Yeah.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:06]** All right.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:08]** And what was your name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:08]** Does it melt men?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:13]** No, but if you watch the show, I mean, it saves kids, right?

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** It saves families.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:17]** It saves the government sometimes.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:20]** Those episodes were cut some places.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:23]** Impressive resume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:25]** Yeah.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:27]** And can you please introduce yourself?

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:27]** I'm Shay.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** We've met.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:31]** Oh, I thought this was the half-arc talking.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:34]** Does this sound like half-orc talking?

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:34]** This is Shay.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:36]** You're looking at me.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:37]** Are you okay?

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:45]** The medbay is right through this door and points past the spine gentleman that we're completely ignoring, but whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:46]** All right.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:46]** Medbay.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** Fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:49]** I feel bad for the half-orc.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:51]** It's like, oh, check out this cool robot.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:52]** Ignore that guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:53]** Yeah.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]** Do you want to talk to the half-orc?

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:57]** I just want to know his name.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** For sure.


## Speaker_0

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:01]** What you reading there, friend?

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:02]** What's going on, guy?

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** You walk over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:05]** Horky.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:07]** It's kind of rare, I feel, to see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:08]** How you doing?

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:08]** Yeah, what's up?

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:14]** Sorry, did you just say it's kind of rare to see a half-orc?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:21]** I've met all kinds of sorts, but to be honest, it's not common that I come across an orc of any sort, half or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:25]** She looks at Shay, just like, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:31]** You are the first half-orc that we have run into during our time of playing Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:31]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:34]** Holy fourth wall break, Batman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:38]** I don't know what you're talking about there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:39]** What's your name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** My name's Orgat.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:43]** Orgat.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:44]** What's your name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:45]** My name is Hears.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** What are you reading?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:48]** Oh, hey, years.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:58]** Well, you know, the thing is that I really... I mean, if you have not followed Phrasma, then, uh, I don't know.

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:13]** I think it's very important that given that we just lost two of our crewmates, I thought now would be a good time to ground myself in the teachings of embracing death and the warmth of joining Phrasma.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:16]** So I am in some ways...

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:16]** morning.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:20]** In other ways, I am celebrating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:23]** Are you a member of the stewards or of the Pike's Puritan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:25]** I don't think the stewards would like me.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:28]** No, I'm with Pike.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:29]** I'm with Orphear.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** Is somebody opening a door?

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:33]** I kept hearing a door open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:39]** Is there a bathroom around here that I can deposit some fluids?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:41]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:42]** Hold on one second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:44]** I've been holding it since...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:46]** It's nice to meet you.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:47]** Yeah, no, I totally get it.

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:49]** I don't know how that works, but it's totally good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:51]** We had to breeze the bathroom humor somewhere.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:53]** It's to get really slim in here very quickly.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:54]** Yeah, definitely, for sure.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:58]** This is so willful of us to just be bullshitting around.

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:58]** I know.

**[01:04:59 - 01:04:59]** Nothing I love.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:01]** 100%.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:03]** Nothing meaningful happens.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:08]** Everyone listening and watching, just budget, I don't know, one year for this book.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** Yeah, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:11]** Because it's going to be a lot of talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:13]** It's a lot of talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:15]** Alright, look, so that's the medbay.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:18]** That's the medbay.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:21]** Kaniko's in there, so if you go in there, just be quiet.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:22]** She's trying to rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:24]** We'll see you later.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:30]** And then you can see that some of the other... So the door to the left is the one into the medbay corridor.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:38]** The doors right immediately around this section are the main crew corridors for some of the more senior crew here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:41]** Is the restroom here...

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:46]** No, that would be gnarliest quarters if you're looking at the one on the bottom right.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:48]** Please don't go.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:49]** Here, I'll show you where.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:50]** It's fine.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:50]** It's okay.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:51]** Don't worry about it.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:52]** Don't worry about it.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:52]** It's fine.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:53]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:54]** Should I just open all the doors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:55]** Yes.

**[01:05:55 - 01:06:03]** Actually, I think we want to bring in a lot of passive ventilation in the ship, so I'm going to open up that window outside, and then we'll open up the doors.


## Speaker_0

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:06]** And that's the best way, I think, to cool a starship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:08]** To compress the starship in the drift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:09]** Yeah, no, that's cool.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:10]** That's good.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:13]** All right, let's go down to the lower deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:14]** Okay.

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:17]** You go down to the lower deck.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:20]** Jump in through your cool foundry module.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:24]** Also, shout out, by the way, to Leslie for helping to set that up.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:25]** That was super helpful.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:27]** Thank you, Leslie.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:28]** Thanks, Liz.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:29]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:32]** We are in another hallway full of doors.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:34]** Yeah, so here's the thing.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:36]** I'm getting flashbacks to Omicron.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** Okay, all right.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:39]** I mean, it was intense.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:40]** I'm not trying to do that.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:42]** Oh, God, yeah, true.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:43]** PTSD for real.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:45]** Maybe the four of you take some time.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:46]** So here's the thing.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:52]** I know for a fact that Gnarla had some reports to write.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:54]** So I think everyone's going to be a little busy.

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:58]** There is going to be an event.

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:23]** later watching rutaris right so we're gonna get that download it's gonna hit us at around maybe 11 10 30 i'm not sure which and so a couple of us are gonna be watching that over in the galley and points to the end of the hallway uh where there's a door that goes into the galley and that door is open should have been open

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:24]** So here's the thing.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** These are going to be your rooms.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:28]** Dr. OK, are you just wandering off?

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:28]** Come on back.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:29]** Come on back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:33]** Make sure that the dietary restrictions were followed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:34]** Sure.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:35]** Yeah, I understand that.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:37]** Just and then as as you walk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:42]** But I really do need to find a place, a water closet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:42 - 01:08:12]** oh sure sure sure yeah okay that that is actually going to be over here and points to the door next to the galley conveniently and so all right well look while dr okay is uh doing their thing and bernice is following it's a little weird does the melted man doesn't come to the bathroom with me but i guess he goes into the bathroom and dr okay that's fine i don't know how to deselect her all right we'll figure that out i don't know how to tell bernice stop like all uh amazing

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:16]** All right, so, yeah, so like I said, there's going to be a Brutaris match.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:19]** So if you guys, if you all want, you can come and hang out.

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:22]** It might be kind of nice to just commune with some people.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:28]** I don't know who else you met down there, but it might be nice to just talk, just have some camaraderie and relax.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:33]** It's now maybe, I guess, 1830.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:35]** Oh, good.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:36]** You're back, Doctor.

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:36]** Okay, great.


## Speaker_0

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:37]** Cool.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:35]** I mean, like, are you just doing a sort of... Just, like, looking you up and down to see if you're, like, if you've got any shakes or, like, if there's an extraordinary amount of excrement coming out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:45]** No, I think at this point now, having used the water closet briefly, he seems more composed.


## Speaker_0

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:49]** but before he was definitely tiptoeing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:50]** He was doing the pee pee dance.

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:51]** Dope.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:52]** Yeah.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:54]** That was a, that was a 28 medicine check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:54 - 01:09:55]** Yeah.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:55]** Yeah.

**[01:09:55 - 01:10:00]** You totally notice, uh, a sign of relief on his face.

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:01]** Got it.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:01]** Nice.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:05]** Like he's been driving around for six hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:10]** Colin, do you like put your finger in the, in like the ooze from Dr. Okay.

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:13]** You just kind of make sure you're good.

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:15]** You're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:18]** All right, so look, these are going to be your rooms here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:21]** Walks to the east end of the hall, opens up two doors.

**[01:10:22 - 01:10:25]** And inside, the rooms are pretty Spartan.

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:28]** There's a blue... There's two to a room.

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:30]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:10:31 - 01:10:32]** These are a little tighter here.

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:36]** These ships are not made for the most comfort.

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:38]** The room seems Spartan.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:43]** There's just a closet and a sink, two in one, in the back.

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:45]** And then there are two beds.

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:49]** Both the beds, again, blue, steward blue blankets.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:53]** And the pillow's pretty natural.

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:55]** Everything's pretty bare.

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:58]** But it's cozy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:58 - 01:11:02]** Well, Doctor, would you like to bump together as men of medicine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:04]** Ooh, why not?

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:05]** Sorry, uh...

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:06]** Oh, sorry.

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:08]** Are you just going and just opening doors?

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:09]** Yeah, I kind of was.

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:10]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:12]** Yeah, that's just people's rooms, so it's fine.

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:17]** And that last one that you opened, you actually looked in there.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:22]** And, yeah, there was somebody in there.

**[01:11:23 - 01:11:24]** Yeah, it's okay.

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:28]** They don't get a chance to say anything to you because you shut the door.

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:31]** It was just a human male sitting on the bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:35]** All right, look, so...

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:37]** What's going to happen is this.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:38]** Yeah, we got that Protaris match.

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:43]** Like Gnarla said, there will be a funeral set up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:46]** Shay's voice is really hard.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:47]** My voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:50]** And then, oh, one last thing.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:52]** Not many people know about this.

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:54]** Do any of you like Strawberry Machine Cake?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:56 - 01:11:57]** I. Does it have any salt?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:59]** No, no, no.

**[01:11:59 - 01:11:59]** The band.

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:01]** Clearly, maybe you don't know.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:02]** Strawberry Machine Cake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:05]** No, I'm afraid I don't.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:10]** Would I know a kind of culture?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:16]** You might know them being contemporary of Panic at the Disco or The Killers.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:19]** A little punk, a little emo.

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:21]** But we've heard of them before, right?

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:23]** Yeah, you're like, oh, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:27]** I'm a 20 on my culture tech, so I'll probably listen to them.

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:31]** I have been invited on them a few times.

**[01:12:32 - 01:12:33]** I do enjoy them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:35]** Okay, yeah.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:36]** Yeah, they're fucking great.

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:37]** Anyway, so here's the thing.

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:42]** We actually, they're single, coincidentally, also coming out, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:52]** And just to piss Gnar off, I said it, so when it hits our servers, it's just going to start playing really loudly.

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:56]** So just be prepared around, like, you know, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:56 - 01:12:59]** This is quite the ship you get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:03]** Well, you know, look, you have to balance out these sensitive missions sometimes, right?

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:05]** You know, it's like Gnarl is the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:07]** I appreciate your candor and the warning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:09]** Yeah, so it might be a little loud.

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:15]** If you want, I can set it so it doesn't go off in these rooms here in case you guys yell here.

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:16]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:17]** I would appreciate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:23]** Yeah, I'd also appreciate it, but I think that's good on you about your plan.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:24]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:26]** Well, you know, pranks just kind of ease the levity.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:29]** You know, it's good to have some levity aboard a ship.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:31]** Anyway, Melt the Man, make sure you, uh, you, oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:32 - 01:13:35]** Melty Man starts to shout it really loud, and then it's like, that's fine.

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:38]** It realizes Melty Man is not there, and I'll take care of it.

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:38]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:39]** All right.

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:39]** I'm going to go.

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:40]** I have some things to do.

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:41]** Relax.

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:42]** Enjoy yourself.

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:43]** There is a gym, by the way.

**[01:13:43 - 01:13:49]** There is also a faith center if you want to take some time to pray or do whatever you need.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:51]** And then you can also read.

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:54]** There's a bunch of books in the lounge where Orgat was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:54 - 01:14:01]** And, yeah, if you have any questions, just – Where is the gym and the faith center?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:03]** Yeah, they're actually down at the other end of the hall.

**[01:14:03 - 01:14:05]** Next to the restroom?

**[01:14:05 - 01:14:10]** Yeah, so the gym is right next to the restroom, and then the Faith Center is right across the hall from that.

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:10]** Oh.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:11]** Splendid.

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:12]** Thank you.

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:15]** Bill, you are more than welcome.

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:16]** Don't even worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:19]** It looks like you and I are going to have to bunk together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:20]** All right, bye.

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:21]** And Shay walks with you, Shay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:22]** Looks like it.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:23]** Bye.

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:23]** Bye, Shay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:30]** All right, here's a sleep with a couple of the honeycombs of his eyes open.

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:32]** Okay.

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:32]** It will be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:37]** Yeah, so you all have the space on the lower deck to yourselves, and you can wander around.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:40]** It's probably about 1845 right now.

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:43]** You've been walking, talking, using the bathroom.

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:45]** I want to encourage you.

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:48]** This is a little unconstructed time.

**[01:14:48 - 01:14:50]** This is time for you to do what you're thinking.

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:54]** So we can go around if you all want to do something together.

**[01:14:54 - 01:15:02]** I'm handing it over to you all or we can go one by one and see what you all are doing for the next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:03]** Yeah.

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:04]** What's up?

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:12]** So I think I think Colin is probably like he's so rattled right now.

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:28]** Or has been so rattled for the last eight or ten hours between fighting a radioactive troll and discovering that he's on some sort of asteroid gray ship and fighting for his life and meeting all these new people.

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:33]** That adrenaline rush has just tanked.

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:35]** And so he is asleep on his feet.

**[01:15:35 - 01:15:42]** The first thing he's going to do is crawl into whatever flat surface is nearest and take him a good long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:43 - 01:15:45]** I'll agree to that.

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:46]** I think Rick is kind of feeling the same thing.

**[01:15:46 - 01:15:50]** This is the first time they've been able to actually relax.

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:56]** And so he does... He wants to go straight into the room, but he can't because Hears is in the way.

**[01:15:57 - 01:16:03]** Hears takes one mandible and flips him off.

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:05]** Oh, I still can't go in there.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:05]** You can do it now, Rick.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:06]** It's fine.

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:11]** So, yeah, Rick goes in and lays down on a bed, or sits down on the bed.

**[01:16:12 - 01:16:13]** He takes off his jacket.

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:24]** He starts unloading all the weapons and all the gear that they have, tucks it aside, and he finally can just, like, decompress on everything that has happened over the last two books.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:25 - 01:16:30]** Uh, here's just going to go to the, the prayer room essentially.

**[01:16:30 - 01:16:31]** Okay.

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:35]** Um, so that's up over, he goes to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:36]** Yeah.

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:36]** Yeah.

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:37]** So it's, so it's to the right.

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:41]** It's, it's the last door on the right before you get to the galley.

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:50]** And as, as you're about to go in, you hear a couple of voices talking in the galley, but as soon as you walk into the face center, it's quiet.


## Speaker_0

**[01:16:50 - 01:16:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:50 - 01:16:53]** This is it right here with this purple and blue ambient lighting.

**[01:16:53 - 01:16:54]** That's really pretty.

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:56]** What's with these three machines?

**[01:16:56 - 01:16:58]** Is it per religion or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:02]** There are a bunch of different tiers and altars.

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:15]** It seems like it's pretty, again, Spartan, but set up so that way every major, let's call it, religion has some sort of a shelf where there is probably a symbol or an emblem, right?

**[01:17:15 - 01:17:16]** Fun fact.

**[01:17:16 - 01:17:16]** Yeah.

**[01:17:16 - 01:17:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:20]** Starfinder religions are a lot like gambling and casinos.

**[01:17:22 - 01:17:25]** So every religion has their own slot machine.

**[01:17:25 - 01:17:29]** So anytime you find an established casino... Ding, ding!

**[01:17:30 - 01:17:31]** That's what you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:34]** And then you get checked.

**[01:17:34 - 01:17:37]** And then Meltaman comes by and says, like, you've won, citizen.

**[01:17:37 - 01:17:38]** And then hands you a bunch of chips.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:39 - 01:17:39]** Oh, my God.

**[01:17:40 - 01:17:42]** The prospect of all of this is really annoying.

**[01:17:42 - 01:17:43]** He's going to lock the door behind him for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:54]** I think my favorite mental picture is that is of Meltaman handing them chips, but not like poker casino chips, but like fried potato.

**[01:17:55 - 01:17:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:57 - 01:17:59]** You've won, citizen.

**[01:17:59 - 01:17:59]** Delicious.

**[01:17:59 - 01:18:01]** You've won some chips, citizen.

**[01:18:01 - 01:18:09]** Yeah, so there's like an Abadar self, Demortosh, Desna, Hylak, Siyomide, Phrasma, Sarenrae, Triune, Waden, and Yara Issa.

**[01:18:10 - 01:18:11]** No Besmaro.

**[01:18:11 - 01:18:15]** And also, there is on the top, Ibra as well.

**[01:18:15 - 01:18:17]** It seemed like that was added in later.

**[01:18:17 - 01:18:19]** Yeah, Ibra.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:46]** what did you just call me bruh ebra oh what is that ebra bruv it's another yeah it's yeah it's another god is it a shadow of besmara oh okay it's just with him do you want to do a starfinder story time so is that what you're trying to do we can do a starfinder story time if you want to explain no no no it's okay oh yeah all right yeah it's okay no starfinder story time then all right cool yeah um well so what's going on in there

**[01:18:47 - 01:18:52]** Well, uh, here's is going to take a position of, of prayer, just kind of like leans down.

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:55]** Cause you can't find a Besmara idol or that's unclear to him, I guess.

**[01:18:56 - 01:19:07]** So then he's just going to like, uh, you know, kind of like look at the floor and through his mind flashes, like Rolu and the whole scenario that he's going through.

**[01:19:07 - 01:19:15]** And then he like leans forward and he's like, Besmara, it's very rare that I call on you.

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:19]** I don't like to, uh, I don't like to ask too much.

**[01:19:21 - 01:19:22]** But.

**[01:19:24 - 01:19:26]** And then you just like, it just trails out.

**[01:19:28 - 01:19:31]** Cause you don't get to hear what he's asking, but he is praying.

**[01:19:34 - 01:19:34]** Okay.

**[01:19:34 - 01:19:35]** He finishes up.

**[01:19:36 - 01:19:37]** And then he leaves.

**[01:19:38 - 01:19:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:41 - 01:19:50]** and doctor oh yeah that's it yeah doctor okay that's it yeah or colin colin went to bed rick 19 went to bed


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:51 - 01:19:53]** So Rick is in his room.

**[01:19:53 - 01:19:57]** He's actually taking off his armor and everything, too.

**[01:19:57 - 01:19:59]** He feels that comfortable on the ship.

**[01:19:59 - 01:20:08]** Knowing that they're the stewards, he looks up to the stewards and admires them, so he feels comfortable being within their protection.

**[01:20:09 - 01:20:13]** And so for that, he starts to take off everything and sets it aside and puts it in the locker next to his bed.

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:19]** And he's going to set an alarm for, what is it, 10 p.m.

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:19]** ?

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:22]** You said they were going to do the ceremony.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:23]** The start of the Brutaris match?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:24]** Yes.

**[01:20:25 - 01:20:27]** Well, I think he would try to attend the ceremony as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:28]** Yeah.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:30]** So the ceremony doesn't seem like it'll be today.

**[01:20:30 - 01:20:31]** There weren't specifics.

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:32]** Okay.

**[01:20:32 - 01:20:33]** Gnarla just said there will be time.

**[01:20:34 - 01:20:34]** Yeah.

**[01:20:34 - 01:20:35]** For that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:38]** And I'm going to take off my armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:38 - 01:20:40]** Oh, wow.

**[01:20:41 - 01:20:43]** You're going full Monty here.

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:44]** Just really going for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:44 - 01:20:45]** No, he's still wearing clothes.

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:46]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:20:48 - 01:20:48]** Okay.

**[01:20:48 - 01:20:50]** This ain't, this ain't only fans.

**[01:20:51 - 01:20:52]** This ain't only saves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:58]** Only saves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:58 - 01:20:59]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:59 - 01:20:59]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:21:00 - 01:21:24]** um and dr okay while bernice is outside um chilling you know kind of just standing watch looking like an inanimate briefcase of course against the door of course and uh i assume colin is just like beat tired he just goes straight hits the hits the pillow and he's asleep before his head hits the pillow yeah

**[01:21:24 - 01:21:52]** yeah yeah and um before dr okay uh kind of put gets in some rest he uh he opens up his data pad and he looks at the message that i believe it was shay handed to him yep and uh he sort of revealing to the listener now uh says on do you want us to take off our headphones or uh you can if you want it's not that important to me

**[01:21:52 - 01:21:54]** Okay.

**[01:21:54 - 01:22:06]** It says, on inducing Osharu genetic gain of function through gene modification, Bushdakis, Navinsti, and others, or et al.

**[01:22:08 - 01:22:20]** And Dr. O'Key sort of mumbles quietly to himself, Bushdakis, what have you done?

**[01:22:20 - 01:22:20]** Hmm.

**[01:22:21 - 01:22:31]** And he starts to sort of reason and call upon Yarisa in his pondering.

**[01:22:31 - 01:22:32]** What have you done?

**[01:22:32 - 01:22:38]** What is the extent of this gain-of-function research?

**[01:22:39 - 01:22:43]** What terrible, terrifying thing could this possibly be?

**[01:22:45 - 01:22:48]** What motives in that?

**[01:22:50 - 01:23:02]** Seeking sort of some sort of wisdom to to understand what what is what he's seeing in front of his face or, you know, what he's reading, you know, trying to understand his colleague, what he's got himself into.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:23:03 - 01:23:06]** I love that you are.

**[01:23:07 - 01:23:11]** It's it's almost like you're meditating in the scientific way because you're probably also ideating.

**[01:23:12 - 01:23:12]** Right?

**[01:23:12 - 01:23:13]** Yeah.

**[01:23:13 - 01:23:18]** You're thinking, you're like, what could gain of function mean if I take it from this route?

**[01:23:18 - 01:23:23]** If I think about the gain of function from like in the lens of biology, right?

**[01:23:23 - 01:23:25]** Is there function like physically or mentally?

**[01:23:25 - 01:23:26]** What genes are we changing?

**[01:23:26 - 01:23:26]** Right.

**[01:23:27 - 01:23:29]** And I imagine it a little bit like that.

**[01:23:29 - 01:23:57]** netflix show that there was like chess where like you're looking at the ceiling you can you can see that the chess on the ceiling you can gambit queen's gambit you start to maybe see around you admit but you don't think of it as like a like oh goodness it just makes sense you're like well i kind of see what i'm thinking and if i draw this out here and it's it comes from this place of like in your mind you have this whiteboard that you're drawing on and then it

**[01:23:57 - 01:24:00]** begins to visually appear at least before your eyes.

**[01:24:01 - 01:24:07]** And you, you think that maybe Yara Isa, who is supposed to be a mortal scientist who ascended, right.

**[01:24:07 - 01:24:13]** By mastering all this knowledge, you think maybe there's, I'm starting to get somewhere.

**[01:24:13 - 01:24:20]** And I think there's, there's like an inkling of this connection that transcends the,

**[01:24:20 - 01:24:42]** where you are in the drift it transcends all these other planes and for a minute you are pulling down this divine inspiration yeah yeah so you get a plus two to all your saving throws i get connection inkling as a feat yeah something that i added boom i like it yeah

**[01:24:42 - 01:24:50]** I really like this idea that Colin is like, but I'm drawing mental pictures on the ceiling.

**[01:24:50 - 01:24:51]** Why?

**[01:24:51 - 01:24:51]** Why die?

**[01:24:52 - 01:25:00]** Just like taking in this fire hose of information and understanding as you are gaining these, this feet.

**[01:25:00 - 01:25:25]** cool so that that probably i mean between here's praying rick is there anything that you want to add because i'm i'm thinking now we're we're moving into maybe the the what is it the 1920 hour i i don't know how to say all this military time but i'm trying that's seven o'clock yeah so like seven eight o'clock p.m yeah right here's yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:25 - 01:25:37]** He just wants to go in the galley before he sleeps and he sees like three, it's not necessarily going to super engage, but he sees three, by the way, incredibly looking awesome NPCs.

**[01:25:39 - 01:25:39]** They look amazing.

**[01:25:40 - 01:25:41]** I'm going to save description.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:25:41 - 01:25:44]** I have no idea where you're at on this map, so I feel like a listener at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:44 - 01:25:44]** He's going to come back.

**[01:25:45 - 01:25:48]** He's going to come back with everyone and we can describe them together, I think, if you're down.

**[01:25:48 - 01:25:50]** But this is the food.

**[01:25:51 - 01:25:52]** This is like the kitchen, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:25:53 - 01:25:54]** Yeah, this is the galley.

**[01:25:54 - 01:25:56]** Yeah, it seems like the galley.

**[01:25:56 - 01:25:58]** This is where the recap took place, right?

**[01:25:58 - 01:26:01]** Or will take place.

**[01:26:01 - 01:26:10]** And it seems like off to the right, there is a bar slash table area with some stools.

**[01:26:10 - 01:26:14]** And the light outside from the drift illuminates this area.

**[01:26:14 - 01:26:18]** And you can tell that other than the recessed running lights, it's pretty cozy.

**[01:26:18 - 01:26:18]** It's a little small.

**[01:26:19 - 01:26:21]** There are a couple TVs on the right wall.

**[01:26:21 - 01:26:23]** And there's a bar kitchen.

**[01:26:23 - 01:26:33]** And the large bay windows, the three of them at the front, really bring in a lot of light and give this space a nice homey feel.

**[01:26:33 - 01:26:35]** And when you walk in, yeah, there are three characters.

**[01:26:35 - 01:26:41]** There is a dwarf who is standing there, a little older.

**[01:26:41 - 01:26:43]** There is an elf.

**[01:26:43 - 01:26:46]** And then there is a large human male.

**[01:26:47 - 01:26:51]** And when you walk in, the human male looks over.

**[01:26:51 - 01:26:52]** First, the dwarf and the elf look over.

**[01:26:53 - 01:26:58]** And then the human male looks over and says, Oi!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:26:59 - 01:27:00]** How are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:27:01 - 01:27:02]** Hey, what's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:27:03 - 01:27:08]** You must be one of the survivors.

**[01:27:09 - 01:27:09]** Is that right?

**[01:27:10 - 01:27:11]** Says the word trepidatiously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:12 - 01:27:14]** Yeah, I'm a survivor.

**[01:27:15 - 01:27:17]** Or as we like to say in my little group, Thriver.

**[01:27:17 - 01:27:18]** Yeah, we made it out of there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:27:19 - 01:27:19]** Thriver.

**[01:27:20 - 01:27:20]** That's nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:21 - 01:27:21]** I'm over here.

**[01:27:23 - 01:27:26]** Ah, here's pleasure to meet you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:27:26 - 01:27:29]** I run this misfits right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:29 - 01:27:31]** Ah, you're the big boss, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:27:31 - 01:27:33]** Yep, I'm the big boss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:27:33 - 01:27:35]** This is SARS-L, points to the elf.

**[01:27:35 - 01:27:36]** Ah, pleasure.

**[01:27:36 - 01:27:37]** The SARS-L, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:27:37 - 01:27:38]** Hi.

**[01:27:38 - 01:27:38]** How you doing?

**[01:27:39 - 01:27:39]** How's it going?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:40 - 01:27:40]** Shakes her hand.

**[01:27:41 - 01:27:42]** It's a great pleasure.

**[01:27:42 - 01:27:46]** It almost looks like you have an invisibility cloak on, or what is that right there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:27:48 - 01:27:49]** I don't know that I'll quite say it.

**[01:27:49 - 01:27:51]** I mean, shawl is a generous term.

**[01:27:51 - 01:27:53]** It is very nice, I have to say.

**[01:27:53 - 01:27:56]** It is not an invisibility cloak, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:27:56 - 01:27:59]** But, I mean, I can tell you made it if you're trying to get one, you know.

**[01:27:59 - 01:28:04]** And then just out of nowhere, the dwarf leans over and goes, Hey, I'm dwarf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:28:04 - 01:28:05]** How you doing?

**[01:28:05 - 01:28:06]** Oh, I didn't see you there.

**[01:28:06 - 01:28:08]** He just like kind of like turns around.

**[01:28:08 - 01:28:08]** That's kind of rude.

**[01:28:08 - 01:28:09]** He's like a dwarf.

**[01:28:09 - 01:28:12]** Oh, no, I didn't mean it as an insult, just being literal.

**[01:28:13 - 01:28:13]** Apologies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:28:13 - 01:28:15]** I also wasn't taking it as an insult.

**[01:28:15 - 01:28:18]** I was just saying that might be kind of rude just as a note, but just a point of fact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:28:18 - 01:28:19]** I'll keep it in mind for the future.

**[01:28:19 - 01:28:25]** He kind of like reaches around the elf, but like the dwarf's arms are really short, so it's going to take a lot here.

**[01:28:25 - 01:28:26]** All right.

**[01:28:26 - 01:28:27]** He reaches way forward.

**[01:28:28 - 01:28:28]** How's it going?

**[01:28:29 - 01:28:30]** I'm just going to come over here and meet you.

**[01:28:30 - 01:28:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[01:28:31 - 01:28:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:28:32 - 01:28:33]** Yeah, it's good.

**[01:28:33 - 01:28:33]** It's good.

**[01:28:33 - 01:28:37]** Actually, we were just actually talking about probably the best way, right?

**[01:28:37 - 01:28:40]** So if you are a Red Sonic fan, right?

**[01:28:40 - 01:28:44]** And then if you are actually going to be a Blaze fan, right?

**[01:28:44 - 01:28:50]** Then the question is, once the Red Sonic, given their history, once they get the ball, right?

**[01:28:50 - 01:28:53]** Will they actually be able to get it in the goal?

**[01:28:54 - 01:28:55]** Because typically, right?

**[01:28:55 - 01:28:59]** Usually you have your forwards that are just... They have just gotten the worst people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:29:00 - 01:29:01]** And then Orvier kind of just says, well...

**[01:29:03 - 01:29:04]** Here's, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:29:05 - 01:29:07]** Are... Do you know what we're talking about?

**[01:29:08 - 01:29:12]** Shirin, like, can't... Their eyes can't really glaze over, but you do see, like, the reflection sort of dull.

**[01:29:13 - 01:29:15]** Because, like, yeah, yours is no clue what's going on.

**[01:29:16 - 01:29:18]** So, I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:29:18 - 01:29:23]** I think it might be a little beyond their depth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:29:23 - 01:29:33]** I have to say, I'm not too familiar, but we can maybe watch a game in the galley sometime or wherever you have your display units or whatever.

**[01:29:33 - 01:29:34]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:29:34 - 01:29:36]** We'll be watching the game actually tonight.

**[01:29:37 - 01:29:39]** So you should join.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:29:39 - 01:29:39]** I'll think about it.

**[01:29:39 - 01:29:42]** We might have to turn in early after everything we went through.

**[01:29:42 - 01:29:44]** But if I'm still awake, I'll join you.

**[01:29:47 - 01:29:47]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:29:48 - 01:29:52]** Definitely sleep through just the most intense moments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:29:52 - 01:30:19]** game of brutal rs that there is but it's fine it's fine don't worry it's all right you're really you're really selling it um i mean this is why my crew likes me you know i really push him so i'm just it's fine it's fine here's just starts to back away towards like where the drinks are he's like yeah yeah yeah he's just like backing up like his arms behind him he's gonna take like a couple waters does rick drink water kevin or like oil or blood or what does he drink like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:30:19 - 01:30:21]** Definitely blood.

**[01:30:21 - 01:30:32]** I do love the fact that this big sports event probably already happened, and they're getting the recorded version eight days later.

**[01:30:33 - 01:30:38]** And I feel like one of them probably already knows the outcome and is using that to bet against everyone else.

**[01:30:38 - 01:30:43]** They got a text message from their best friend saying, hey, I can't believe the Red Sonics won.

**[01:30:44 - 01:30:46]** Is that what you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:30:46 - 01:30:48]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:30:48 - 01:30:52]** They would actually send us video of the Super Bowl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:30:54 - 01:30:57]** I definitely didn't use this to hustle people, but if I did...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:30:57 - 01:30:57]** Yeah.

**[01:30:58 - 01:30:58]** Yeah.

**[01:30:58 - 01:30:59]** But if I should have.

**[01:30:59 - 01:31:00]** I should have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:31:00 - 01:31:00]** Yeah.

**[01:31:00 - 01:31:00]** Yeah.

**[01:31:00 - 01:31:02]** It's fine.

**[01:31:02 - 01:31:05]** Kelly, you get the sense that they are very friendly and nice.

**[01:31:05 - 01:31:07]** They're warm and welcoming.

**[01:31:08 - 01:31:08]** Yeah.

**[01:31:08 - 01:31:08]** Yeah.

**[01:31:09 - 01:31:13]** So, I mean, you are welcome to stay and continue to talk to them or if you're going to head out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:14 - 01:31:15]** Well.

**[01:31:16 - 01:31:18]** Okay, first of all, I just want to make a comment.

**[01:31:18 - 01:31:22]** Jon, I really appreciate that there's elves and dwarves and orcs.

**[01:31:23 - 01:31:27]** Like, the old world is here, which I don't really see in Starfinder very often.

**[01:31:27 - 01:31:28]** So it's really cool to see old world races.

**[01:31:29 - 01:31:30]** So thank you for incorporating them.

**[01:31:30 - 01:31:32]** They're awesome.

**[01:31:32 - 01:31:35]** Also, their leader looks like he's from Star Wars or something.

**[01:31:35 - 01:31:38]** But anyway, he's going to bring the waters back and drop one off for Kevin.

**[01:31:38 - 01:31:41]** And then I think he will...

**[01:31:41 - 01:31:44]** rest next to Kevin and be like, I'll talk to you guys tomorrow then, eh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:31:46 - 01:31:49]** We're new to Foundry and I love that I can see where the mouse is, but I can't see Hears.

**[01:31:50 - 01:31:54]** So I think I see him moving the hallway and then, oh, there's Hears.

**[01:31:54 - 01:31:55]** Now that he's in my view.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:31:55 - 01:31:56]** There's Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:31:56 - 01:32:01]** I think when you come in, Rick is actually asleep at this point.

**[01:32:01 - 01:32:02]** He's trying to rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:32:02 - 01:32:09]** He leaves it next to your sleeping body on the little console and closes his eyes.

**[01:32:10 - 01:32:12]** His suit glowing blue.

**[01:32:13 - 01:32:13]** Yeah.

**[01:32:15 - 01:32:15]** Fun to talk.

**[01:32:16 - 01:32:18]** Sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you.

**[01:32:18 - 01:32:18]** Go ahead.

**[01:32:19 - 01:32:19]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:32:19 - 01:32:20]** I'm done, man.

**[01:32:22 - 01:32:23]** So it's around 8.

**[01:32:24 - 01:32:25]** Time passes.

**[01:32:26 - 01:32:26]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:32:27 - 01:32:30]** Do you continue researching?

**[01:32:30 - 01:32:30]** Yeah.

**[01:32:30 - 01:32:33]** You, you, your eyes also become heavy.

**[01:32:33 - 01:32:35]** You, you start studying the inside of your eyes.

**[01:32:35 - 01:32:38]** It feels easier to think maybe when your eyes are closed, right?

**[01:32:38 - 01:32:40]** You're like, ah, yeah.

**[01:32:40 - 01:32:42]** And then you fall asleep before you fall asleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:43 - 01:32:44]** And now the explosion.

**[01:32:44 - 01:32:46]** This is, this is what I feel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:32:46 - 01:32:47]** Everyone just falls over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:32:47 - 01:32:51]** This is what I feel like John sets us up for whatever catastrophe, uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:54 - 01:32:56]** Rick actually goes and sleeps in the gunner's chair.

**[01:32:57 - 01:32:59]** You sleep in the gunner's chair, really?

**[01:32:59 - 01:33:00]** Right.

**[01:33:00 - 01:33:02]** Hands on the controls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:33:03 - 01:33:03]** Amazing.

**[01:33:05 - 01:33:05]** Okay.

**[01:33:05 - 01:33:06]** So, yeah, it's about 8, 9.

**[01:33:08 - 01:33:12]** Rick, were you the only person who set an alarm to wake up around 10?

**[01:33:15 - 01:33:16]** Does anybody else want to wake up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:33:16 - 01:33:17]** I throw my hands up.

**[01:33:17 - 01:33:18]** I don't know who else set their alarms.

**[01:33:18 - 01:33:20]** I know I set one, but yes, I set one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:33:20 - 01:33:24]** Do we have enough time to rest long before this game?

**[01:33:25 - 01:33:29]** You can't get a long rest in because you boarded around 6 p.m.

**[01:33:30 - 01:33:35]** or so, and you got a little tour, kind of got all cozy for yourself.

**[01:33:35 - 01:33:39]** You know, when you have a guest over, at some point you have to be like, you do your thing, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:33:40 - 01:33:43]** I think I got four hours of a full rest, so I'll take the other four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:33:44 - 01:33:48]** Each match is maybe one to two hours.

**[01:33:48 - 01:33:49]** Maybe it goes a little over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:33:49 - 01:33:56]** That's also normal to wake up in the middle of the night just to watch a movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:33:56 - 01:33:57]** Are we jet lagged?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:33:58 - 01:33:58]** We don't get a full rest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:33:59 - 01:34:05]** If you wake up and watch the game, you don't get a full rest before whatever happens at 8 p.m.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:34:05 - 01:34:06]** Yeah, before the explosions.

**[01:34:07 - 01:34:11]** Before there's a riot on this ship and over the Brutaris game.

**[01:34:11 - 01:34:13]** Here's his attempt to take a full rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:34:14 - 01:34:15]** Okay, so here's going to sleep through.

**[01:34:15 - 01:34:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:34:17 - 01:34:20]** So we are now, the alarms are going off, so Rick is going to get up.

**[01:34:21 - 01:34:26]** He is not going to wear his armor or bring any weapons with him because, again, he feels comfortable on the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:34:28 - 01:34:28]** Okay.

**[01:34:29 - 01:34:35]** Bernice is in the hallway just in case something goes awry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:34:35 - 01:35:02]** and on you know maybe overhearing and chat gpt summary of uh what what she can overhear from the galley okay rick rick steps out of his room where he's sharing that he's sharing with hears and he sees bernice like almost leaned up against the door uh and she doesn't have a knife out but he he nods at her and says good evening and then walks away from her does bernice say anything

## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:35:31 - 01:35:36]** We went into night mode on Foundry because it's getting later at night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:35:36 - 01:35:38]** This is what happens when you're in Delta One.

**[01:35:39 - 01:35:39]** The lights dim.

**[01:35:40 - 01:35:40]** Purple.

**[01:35:41 - 01:35:41]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:35:41 - 01:35:42]** Yeah.

**[01:35:43 - 01:35:44]** So the lights are lower.

**[01:35:45 - 01:35:50]** There seems to be like a blue and purple kind of running light along the main corridors.

**[01:35:50 - 01:35:58]** And what you're seeing in the gallery is pretty lit.

**[01:35:58 - 01:36:00]** And as you approach, Rick, the door was closed.

**[01:36:00 - 01:36:01]** And you can hear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:36:01 - 01:36:28]** there's some like reverie seems like folks have been talking you know it's not too loud you're pretty far from the quarters you walk in there's a large i think rick would yeah like open the door and as little as possible you know squeeze through because he realizes it's dark in there and they're watching the game so he'll he's trying to sneak in even though it's like before the game started oh but come on in you must be one of the other or veer who you just i i'm out of here come on in

**[01:36:29 - 01:36:30]** I'm Rick, Rick 19.

**[01:36:31 - 01:36:36]** And he goes and he's going to sit down right between Shay and whoever is next to Shay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:36:36 - 01:36:37]** Yeah, so there's an elf.

**[01:36:37 - 01:36:38]** And that is Sarza El.

**[01:36:39 - 01:36:42]** And you are right in front of Torv.

**[01:36:42 - 01:36:43]** who is a little rude.

**[01:36:43 - 01:36:44]** They're a dwarf, but it's fine.

**[01:36:44 - 01:36:44]** It's okay.

**[01:36:45 - 01:36:46]** So they can't see it as well.

**[01:36:46 - 01:36:46]** It's fine.

**[01:36:47 - 01:36:47]** Classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:36:48 - 01:36:49]** He stands up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:36:49 - 01:36:49]** I know.

**[01:36:49 - 01:36:50]** I'm joking.

**[01:36:50 - 01:36:50]** Judge me.

**[01:36:51 - 01:36:52]** Torb is sitting next to Ezra.

**[01:36:53 - 01:36:58]** Oh, I didn't even show you the little cue-in of all these people.

**[01:36:58 - 01:37:04]** Let's see if I can just get that going while you are walking in.

**[01:37:04 - 01:37:07]** Everyone seems to be... The game is going on.

**[01:37:07 - 01:37:10]** Everyone does seem to be pretty intently focused.

**[01:37:11 - 01:37:12]** Oh!

**[01:37:12 - 01:37:16]** They're really getting into the game here.

**[01:37:18 - 01:37:20]** Here is Orvier Pyke on the screen.

**[01:37:21 - 01:37:24]** And then here is also Sarzael on the screen as well.

**[01:37:24 - 01:37:24]** Is it his company?

**[01:37:25 - 01:37:25]** Yeah.

**[01:37:25 - 01:37:30]** So you realize that Sarzael, Torv, Ezra, they are all in.

**[01:37:30 - 01:37:32]** They are mercs in Pyke's Paratons.

**[01:37:32 - 01:37:35]** And Orvier Pyke is the leader of Pyke's Paratons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:37:35 - 01:37:37]** I was so close on the spelling for Sarzal.

**[01:37:38 - 01:37:39]** I missed an A. Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:37:39 - 01:37:50]** And then this is actually a good foundry thing that I should leave everybody in the stage so then that way I can quickly show them actually when they're talking.

**[01:37:51 - 01:37:56]** And then this is Torv, who's just a super intense older dwarf.

**[01:37:56 - 01:37:57]** Torv Greycrag.

**[01:37:57 - 01:37:58]** Such a great dwarf name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:37:59 - 01:38:00]** I can't see him very well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:38:01 - 01:38:03]** Would you throw up that second one, please?

**[01:38:04 - 01:38:07]** The second one, meaning... That one, yep.

**[01:38:07 - 01:38:09]** Orvier and Sarzo.

**[01:38:09 - 01:38:11]** Yeah, they look so amazing.

**[01:38:11 - 01:38:12]** Good Lord.

**[01:38:12 - 01:38:12]** Yeah, it does look dope.

**[01:38:13 - 01:38:14]** Yeah, they're...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:38:17 - 01:38:46]** sniper rifle on Sarzell yeah Sarzell is like dope yeah so cool they are and Orvin uh Orvir we should we should describe them pretty dope you know yeah yeah he has his face has like metal uh bars kind of protruding up around his cheekbones and over his forehead like he's he's just heavily armored clearly and he has tattoos kind of matching almost like uh like Drax yeah I would say yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:38:46 - 01:38:47]** Lil Draxy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:38:48 - 01:38:48]** Draxy.

**[01:38:49 - 01:38:50]** He's Lil Draxy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:38:50 - 01:38:55]** I imagine Sarzel's almost like a Legolas-type figure.

**[01:38:56 - 01:38:56]** Yeah.

**[01:38:56 - 01:39:02]** Almost looks just sort of composed and balanced very well.

**[01:39:02 - 01:39:04]** Wearing a cape with a...

**[01:39:04 - 01:39:07]** shapes, patterns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:39:07 - 01:39:10]** She's, she's really into this game though.

**[01:39:10 - 01:39:11]** Cause her pistol is smoking.

**[01:39:11 - 01:39:13]** So she was like, he, he is.

**[01:39:13 - 01:39:14]** So I can't see their face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:39:14 - 01:39:15]** It's okay.

**[01:39:15 - 01:39:19]** I, I will add their pronouns to the name here.

**[01:39:19 - 01:39:22]** So, you know, cause there are a lot of people.

**[01:39:23 - 01:39:45]** is sarzel an elf sarzel is an elf uh identifies he him yep and then narla is there yeah good probably um a wood elf fear i don't know actually i don't know what the elven yeah we can get to it there's some there's some interesting times i think there should be like a story time about that yeah

**[01:39:46 - 01:40:08]** okay rick when when you walk past you recognize the vest that you met i believe you you y'all met a vest when you were first about to board right like yeah down on okay yep fire spitter that's that's her fire spitter i remember super nice not kind of quiet but super nice

**[01:40:09 - 01:40:10]** So it's like 10.

**[01:40:11 - 01:40:12]** They're watching the match.

**[01:40:12 - 01:40:13]** 10.30.

**[01:40:13 - 01:40:14]** Match is going on.

**[01:40:14 - 01:40:17]** It's getting pretty close.

**[01:40:18 - 01:40:20]** But we're getting to around 10.45.

**[01:40:22 - 01:40:23]** Half the match is over.

**[01:40:23 - 01:40:24]** It's halftime.

**[01:40:24 - 01:40:25]** You all start talking.

**[01:40:25 - 01:40:30]** We can go into it if you want, but what is your conversation like with them?

**[01:40:30 - 01:40:32]** Are you trying to get to know them?

**[01:40:32 - 01:40:33]** Are you trying to...

**[01:40:33 - 01:40:56]** like talk rick yeah i mean they're coming up to you to to to talk are i don't during the game i don't think so i think they would have been during like halftime and like oh yeah sure and maybe maybe like ezra and torv they are they're into it but they're also there for the social aspect to just kind of relax a little bit from the stress of the past


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:40:56 - 01:40:58]** How do I clear them from my screen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:40:59 - 01:41:00]** Oh, I'll take them off.

**[01:41:00 - 01:41:01]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:41:01 - 01:41:02]** Or if you're a pike staring at me.

**[01:41:03 - 01:41:05]** So yeah, he's sitting, he's kind of sitting in the middle of all of them.

**[01:41:05 - 01:41:10]** Cause that was the only seat that was open and like right in front of the big screen, I think.

**[01:41:10 - 01:41:14]** And you know, they're handing them food and drinks and he's like, Oh, thank you.

**[01:41:14 - 01:41:16]** And he's kind of just like a little overwhelmed by everything that's happening.

**[01:41:17 - 01:41:26]** And whichever one you want to speak to me, I think I'll respond to, but I'm not going to reach out and communicate directly with anyone purposely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:41:26 - 01:41:36]** I think with that direction from you, I think Orvier at some point, maybe Torv gets a little... Torv and Ezra start talking about some pretty technical things.

**[01:41:36 - 01:41:39]** And Orvier senses that.

**[01:41:40 - 01:41:43]** You can sense that Orvier knows how social things go.

**[01:41:43 - 01:41:44]** He's the leader of Mercs.

**[01:41:44 - 01:41:46]** He knows how to make things flow.

**[01:41:46 - 01:41:49]** So he is like, you know, oh, the game's going to get ready to start.

**[01:41:50 - 01:41:51]** Just let Rick...

**[01:41:51 - 01:41:56]** relax and just ask you one or two questions just to kind of ease you out of that conversation.

**[01:41:56 - 01:41:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:41:57 - 01:41:59]** Sure, yeah.

**[01:41:59 - 01:41:59]** Thank you.

**[01:41:59 - 01:42:00]** I appreciate that.

**[01:42:00 - 01:42:04]** I've actually never watched a game of this type of sport.

**[01:42:05 - 01:42:08]** It is quite interesting, but I have no idea what is going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:42:08 - 01:42:09]** That's all right.

**[01:42:10 - 01:42:19]** I'll try and point out some of the more interesting things, but you are in for the first match that you watch.

**[01:42:20 - 01:42:21]** You got lucky.

**[01:42:21 - 01:42:22]** This is a good one.

**[01:42:22 - 01:42:23]** This is a real good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:42:26 - 01:42:28]** Match comes back on.

**[01:42:28 - 01:42:29]** People are cheering.

**[01:42:29 - 01:42:31]** There's clearly an underdog.

**[01:42:32 - 01:42:34]** You're really getting to it.

**[01:42:36 - 01:42:39]** And it's maybe 11, 11.15.

**[01:42:40 - 01:42:42]** Starts to get to around 11.30.

**[01:42:45 - 01:42:55]** And suddenly, of course, Gnarla says, what the

**[01:42:58 - 01:43:07]** And then out of nowhere, Strawberry Machine Cake just starts blaring out of nowhere.

**[01:43:07 - 01:43:09]** And this loud music.

**[01:43:09 - 01:43:22]** And I think Dr. OK and Colin and Hears, if you think you might be woken up by that, even though it's not in your room but it's outside, then definitely roll a perception check to see if you even would wake up.

**[01:43:23 - 01:43:24]** If you think you're too far asleep, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:43:24 - 01:43:25]** That's okay.

**[01:43:25 - 01:43:31]** I mean, if it's going to interrupt my full rest, I don't want to wake up for it.

**[01:43:31 - 01:43:31]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:43:32 - 01:43:34]** I mean, no, no.

**[01:43:34 - 01:43:36]** It's not mechanically going to stop your full rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:43:36 - 01:43:44]** The camera cuts over to Colin, and you see a big glob of drool just like... Slurp it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:43:45 - 01:43:53]** Dr. O'Key rolled a 25 perception, so I'm assuming... Definitely hears it.

**[01:43:53 - 01:43:53]** Yeah.

**[01:43:53 - 01:43:54]** And...

**[01:43:55 - 01:44:02]** And then puts his tentacles kind of in his ear holes a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:44:02 - 01:44:08]** I think maybe you also woke up because Bernice got scared and was like, Dr. O'Kane, Dr. O'Kane.

**[01:44:08 - 01:44:08]** And you're like, it's cool.

**[01:44:10 - 01:44:11]** That's fine.

**[01:44:11 - 01:44:14]** You put these squishy tentacles in your ears.

**[01:44:14 - 01:44:17]** And Rick, it's like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:44:17 - 01:44:19]** Rick, Rick expected it.

**[01:44:19 - 01:44:23]** And he does listen to a strawberry shortcake, strawberry machine cake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:44:24 - 01:44:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:44:24 - 01:44:25]** That's what I said.

**[01:44:25 - 01:44:26]** Yeah.

**[01:44:26 - 01:44:34]** And so like when it happens, he notices that the captain is kind of upset by it, but, but he, he's kind of bobbing his head just a little bit too.

**[01:44:34 - 01:44:35]** Like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:44:35 - 01:44:39]** Like, he hears, like, doesn't wake up, but it just, like, pervades his dreams.

**[01:44:40 - 01:44:44]** And then you see his, like, mandibles start to, like, rock out, you know, as he listens to it.

**[01:44:44 - 01:44:48]** You said that this is sort of like, what was it, Avenged Sevenfold?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:44:48 - 01:44:52]** Sure, yeah, it's just like pop-punk, emo, kind of, you know.

**[01:44:52 - 01:44:55]** And the name of the song, yeah, Panic!

**[01:44:55 - 01:44:56]** Let Us Go, Killers.

**[01:44:57 - 01:45:01]** The name of the song is My Code Will Go On, and it seems to be just a really intense...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:45:01 - 01:45:22]** so yeah he thinks back to his like emo days with his like skinny jeans like in his like bangs yeah you know that he like wore on a wig yeah and you know he smiles that's all just in his dream rick 19 roll a perception check oh gosh i don't like this no no no no no no no


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:45:24 - 01:45:35]** Uh, where's my perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:45:35 - 01:45:35]** 14.

**[01:45:35 - 01:45:35]** 14.

**[01:45:36 - 01:45:36]** Okay.

**[01:45:38 - 01:45:39]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:45:40 - 01:45:41]** Your perception woke you up.

**[01:45:44 - 01:45:50]** And when it did, you put your tentacles in your ears.

**[01:45:51 - 01:45:55]** But maybe you open your eyes as you're rolling over, getting comfy.

**[01:45:56 - 01:46:02]** And when you did, you saw that your data pad, maybe you forgot to plug it in.

**[01:46:05 - 01:46:06]** It's on low battery.

**[01:46:07 - 01:46:10]** Brick 19, as the song came on.

**[01:46:12 - 01:46:18]** And you realize that right before the song came on, Gnarla said, what the fuck?

**[01:46:18 - 01:46:19]** And then the song came on.

**[01:46:19 - 01:46:22]** And then the TV lights went out.

**[01:46:22 - 01:46:23]** All three of them went out.

**[01:46:24 - 01:46:26]** And you laugh because you think for a second maybe there was something going on.

**[01:46:27 - 01:46:33]** But then you realize that everyone else around you is also a little confused because maybe they were taking a sip or eating some food.

**[01:46:34 - 01:46:35]** And your food...

**[01:46:36 - 01:46:37]** Is warm.

**[01:46:38 - 01:46:41]** And your drink is warm.

**[01:46:42 - 01:46:43]** Like it's old.

**[01:46:45 - 01:46:46]** Oh, no, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:46:46 - 01:46:47]** No, John.

**[01:46:47 - 01:46:47]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:46:47 - 01:46:49]** And that is episode 70.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:46:49 - 01:46:52]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:46:52 - 01:46:53]** We're back.

**[01:46:53 - 01:46:53]** Oh, man.

**[01:46:53 - 01:46:54]** Threefold's back.

**[01:46:54 - 01:46:55]** Oh, my goodness.

**[01:46:55 - 01:46:57]** It's all an illusion again.

**[01:46:58 - 01:46:59]** Threefold is back.

**[01:46:59 - 01:47:02]** Why do you keep doing this to us?
