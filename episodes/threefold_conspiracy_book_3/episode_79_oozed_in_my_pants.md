**[00:00:01 - 00:00:21]** Previously, on We'll Save... Combat continued with our crew casting concoctions and curses at the confused crewmates coerced by the cultish cosmic conspirators outside the ship, with Kaniko catching the cruel brunt of Chef Orgot's desire to dine for half a taste of cannibal cuisine.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:28]** Amidst the dance of science and sorcery, will the team triumph tactically over these tyrannical traitors?

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:36]** Or will the beastly bites from the bloodthirsty barbarians blot out our band of brothers like orcs in an all-you-can-eat buffet?

**[00:00:37 - 00:00:40]** Find out this time on Will Save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:26]** You have come to the right place.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:31]** This is the story of a girl who cried a river in Toronto.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** That was amazing.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** Thank you.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** You just went right in there, Kevin.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** It was nice.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:36]** Yeah.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:37]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** Look at you, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:40]** A resident troubadour.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** DJ Decker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** What are you doing, DJ Decker?

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** How are we doing?

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** How are we doing today, DJ Decker?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** Yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** You good?

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** DJ Decker?

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** That sounds terrible.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** I don't like that.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:51]** DJ Decker?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:54]** Are you crushing any cans today?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** DJ.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:55]** DJ.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:57]** DJ Decker, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** Crushing cans of Dr. Pepper?

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** DJ Decker, Dr. Pepper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:04]** These are plastic bottles, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:07]** That is my question today on Will Save.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:12]** I am John Swan, Kevin Decker, we have Benny Rodriguez, Kelly Gilliam, and Will No Relation Garrett.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:16]** And our question of the day is, what type of day is it, Will?

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:21]** What's the national holiday that we're celebrating on September 27th?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:33]** Well, we were going to celebrate National Crush It Can Day because that is today, but we all deeply resonated with National Chocolate Milk Day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:36]** Dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** I mean, I haven't drank a chocolate milk in years, bro.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:40]** What?

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** What are you doing with your life?

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** I'm a god f***ing adult.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** I drink coffee with lots of sugar instead.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** What do you live for?

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:50]** Yes, you're a god damn adult and no one can stop you.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** Have you had a mocha, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** I have lattes, not mochas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** You don't have mochas?

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** Okay.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** I have lattes.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** I should probably go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:02]** we have a bottle of Hershey's syrup and I don't know how it got in our fridge.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** I think Lauren said that it came with a house.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** Her parents brought it.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:13]** Hershey's syrup will stay in your fridge forever for some reason, but no, her parents brought it over one night and, um, it stayed, it stayed.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:17]** And we've, we've been like, I ran out of creamer for my, my coffee.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:19]** So I was like, Oh, I'm going to make myself a mocha.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** And I poured some hot chocolate.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** Fair enough.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:26]** I mean, a mocha is just an adult hot chocolate or my opinion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** I introduced Grayson to it.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** He loved it.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:33]** One thing I will say is I don't like Hershey's syrup.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** as a chocolate milk base.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:39]** I prefer the powders, like Nestle's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** Ovaltine?

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** Nesquik.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:45]** Ovaltine can die under a rock.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** F*** Ovaltine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** It's the worst.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:53]** But even the Hershey syrup kind of just gets stuck to the wall and falls to the bottom.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** It doesn't actually make a chocolate milk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** So, this is what you're missing.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** American chocolate's not really good.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** This is what you're missing.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:03]** Brown milk with a chocolate syrup finish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:14]** You need... This is my favorite setup, is kept complaining about chocolate milk, and then Kelly says, well, American chocolate's not really... It's terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** American chocolate's the worst.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:18]** And Hershey's is the worst offender.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** And Hershey's is the worst offender.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:20]** Thank you.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** It's true.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** Although Nestle is an evil corporation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Yes.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** I cut you off then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:30]** A milk frother is the cheat code.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:39]** You cannot mechanically with just a hand and a spoon mix it well enough to get the Hershey's and the milk to commingle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** I frothed it this time because I have one.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:50]** And it wasn't enough that by the time I finished my coffee, there was still a layer of chocolate syrup on the bottom.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:54]** I will say the best chocolate milk I have ever had.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:56]** John and I earned it.

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:00]** We talked about this a couple weeks ago about going to Guatemala.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:11]** One of the gifts we got from Guatemala, one of the guys we were working with, his wife makes chocolate bars that you just literally like this big, this round circular piece of chocolate.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:18]** You snap it off into quarters and one quarter of that bar, you drop it into hot milk and it becomes chocolate milk.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:20]** It's pure chocolate and milk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:22]** Have you all ever had Mexican chocolate?

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:22]** Yeah.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** Just like discs with like, so good.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** Yeah, this is the Guatemalan version.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** Oh yeah, I'm sure it's really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:29]** Good, dude.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** Yeah.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** It's real good.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:32]** All their chocolate are all the same.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** Happy Hispanic Heritage Month.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:35 - 00:06:01]** we were originally going to talk about that but it all came full circle it was perfect so yeah thanks for making good chocolate i have to shamelessly plug this one place so i travel around a bit for work i was in greenville illinois and went to a spot called the milk house and the milk house is like part of a farm called rolling lawns did you know what you were going to when you went there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** Cause I'm just saying that could be, Oh yes.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** A hundred percent alone.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:05]** Yes.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:11]** I mean, a place called the milk house in rural Illinois could have been anything.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** I knew it was a dairy place.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:21]** Um, so got some chocolate milk, which like you, you stand at the counter and get your bottle of chocolate milk.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:25]** And you look to the right, and there's, like, the pasteurization facility where they just make everything.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** And there was also an ice cream counter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** There's just, like, a window with cows, you can see.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Like, chilling out.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** It was wild.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** You have to pick which cow makes the milk.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** Yeah, you could do that.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** You could drink it straight from the cow.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** They just shoot her.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** She's into your mouth.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:38]** Colostrum.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** It's good for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:43]** That bypasses a lot of FDA stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:48]** Don't let the FDA... It's like when you're at the hibachi and they throw food for you to catch it in your mouth, but it's milk instead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** They do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** It's a real thing.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:57]** I did it once.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:02]** Kelly, I wish I had so many life experiences.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:04]** I don't know.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:06]** I've never been to a chocolate milk house.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:09]** That sounds pretty amazing to me as far as life experiences go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** That was really good.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:16]** They made their own ice cream, which like, I don't know if you've had really, truly fresh ice cream.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:25]** But it's like, I don't know if you have smart water and compare that to like tap water or spring water, how smart water is just like, it's just water.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:34]** It's like that, but for ice cream, like it's just really good, rich, clean cream sweetness.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** And I got vanilla bean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:38]** So like, I feel bad for those cows though.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** Cause they're just in the freezer all day long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** I know they're probably shivering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:42]** Yeah.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** That's how fresh it is.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** Just straight up the whole time.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:48]** Plus, when you churn the ice cream in them, it's like this.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:52]** Oh, I don't know.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** Have you ever seen a cow?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Have you seen a cow before?

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:59]** I said I actually went through that milk experience that I described.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** For real.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:05]** It's like one of those 70s workout machines that's got the band that goes around your butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:09]** And it's just people wobbling the cows.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:12]** And they're like pouring ice on them and shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:14]** Yeah.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:16]** It's like Wagyu milk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:27]** Wait, if you feed them chocolate milk, then it's like milk-ception or something.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:32]** I would love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:38]** When I was in fifth grade, I loved chocolate milk more than any human should.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:47]** And so I had, there was like parents come to school day, and my dad came in.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** He was like, I play music.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** And folks were like, oh, cool.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** And he's like, I brought my guitar.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** And everyone's like, oh.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** And I was like, yeah, that's my dad.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** That's cool.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** And then he's like, I'm going to play a song for you.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:03]** There is a blues song that's called Malted Milk.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** And then he just calls me out.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:08]** He goes, but my son loves chocolate milk.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:10]** And in fifth grade, I was like...

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:14]** Like, I was just being called out, and I wanted to die.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:18]** Why did you call out in front of all my friends that are low chocolate milk?

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** Yeah.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** Fifth grade is when you start to care.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:29]** And then he starts playing the song Malted Milk, but he replaces it with chocolate milk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:32]** So he's like, chocolate milk, chocolate milk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** It's a great song.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** I love it.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:36]** But just like plays a whole song about chocolate milk.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:38]** And I love that memory.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** And at the time I was so embarrassed.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** Yeah.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:41]** Boy, was it great.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:42]** Yeah.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** It's a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** I don't know.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:46]** Chocolate milk brings back a lot of memories for me.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:50]** In sixth grade, I got $2 for lunch.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:54]** And that $2 bought me the meal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:59]** It was $1.25 for the lunch.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** Roughly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** I don't know.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:04]** It was like $2 gave you the full lunch.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:10]** Or you'd go to a cart line and I would get two chocolate chip cookies and two chocolate milks.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:14]** And that was my lunch every day for almost a full year.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:17]** Because it was a quarter for each of those.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Or 50 cents for each.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** Were you malnourished?

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:22]** Probably.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** That's why you're so short, man.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:30]** You could have been taller if you weren't just eating cookies and chocolate milk all day.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:32]** It explains a lot of things about Kevin, to be fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:41]** I feel like every appointment with the doctor, they're like, sir, you have a lot wrong with you.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:44]** But your bones, man, they are so strong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:49]** Like, no chance of osteoporosis ever in your lifetime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** I never broke any bones as a kid.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** You guys like Yoohoo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** Oh, Yoohoo.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** Yeah, Yoohoo is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** I didn't drink a lot of it.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:01]** It just wasn't available to me, but I did like it when I had it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:06]** Yoohoo to me tastes like somebody made chocolate milk with water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:16]** I, just to put it out there, I grew up on Ovaltine because we didn't have anything else.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** Got it.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:28]** But now I do a fancy chocolate milk, which is a mocha, but I do it with, I basically pour espresso on ice cream, like an affogato.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** Yeah.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:33]** That for me is my milk chocolate fix.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** Bro, I need to come over to your house soon.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:36]** I need to come over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** Anytime, man.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Yeah, we should do it.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:38]** Sounds nice.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** Sounds nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:55]** You know, this is fortuitous because this, or rather serendipitous, because the question that I have, before we decided that it was going to be a national shopping mall, the question that I was going to ask you was, I was going to say, we haven't talked about food, I feel like, in a while, so we need to do that.

**[00:11:56 - 00:12:03]** And my question was going to be, what is the favorite childhood restaurant that you still love to this day?

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** Don't.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:04]** Oh, is that next time?

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:08]** Don't say your answer yet because we should probably play.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:08]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:11]** But I like this streak.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** Saving it for next week?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:14]** We're saving it for next week.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** We're to the point where we're teasing a banter.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** That's good.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:18]** I like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** This is all I'm going to think about the whole episode, though.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** Rick's going to be shooting things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** I'm just going to have a sad memory of a place I used to go.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:28]** Now you're just a place I used to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:32]** Is it closed now?

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** That's so sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** That's so sad.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:37]** Good stuff.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:38]** Good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** All right.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:43]** I'm working on one screen today, so it's going to be a little bit longer in our transitions here, but.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** We still got some recapping to do.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:52]** Does anybody have anything they want to say, by the way, about this previous ep?

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** How are you all feeling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:57]** Yeah, health is a thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:59]** Haven't you been getting hit over and over?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:03]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:06]** I think Colin's feeling pretty good having not murdered anyone.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:09]** I think we've done a good check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:13]** We've done a good job of putting people down without killing them.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** We haven't killed anyone.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** Yeah, we're great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:20]** Dr. OK is still nervous, but he's less nervous than when he slimed on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:28]** Here's is not telling you how much health or stamina he has, John, but he's OK, I think, right now mentally.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:33]** And he's just looking forward to putting down these last two guys.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** Got it.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Got it.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** Don't look at my hair like that.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** I was just going to say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Never, ever do it.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** Take a peep at your hair lab here.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:48]** So this fight has been tactically tough.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:52]** You all came down from the bridge.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:59]** Knowing that there was going to be some bad stuff.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** I almost said a curse word.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:04]** I don't know if we want to say curse words anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** We'll talk about it later.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** We just got Stern talking to us from our mommies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:11]** She was like, I'm going to feed you Ovaltine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:15]** Our mom's name.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** is YouTube, and it's not.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** It may not be happy with us.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:21]** By the way, anyone who doesn't know, we're on YouTube now.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:24]** You can see video of us talking and Twitch and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:27]** If cursing bothers you, we're still bleeped on the audio-only version.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:31]** And if you're on YouTube watching this, hi.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** Thanks for joining us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** Thanks for watching.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:38]** And if you like to listen to curse words, this is where you currently listen to us curse is on YouTube.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:42]** So f***ing hello, everyone.


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:42]** So you guys...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:42 - 00:15:07]** what's up ready for some when you came down that elevator and torv was like boom boom boom i know you're in there and you all came and saved kaniko as kaniko was asking for help from torv and from luvia fire spirit you take them out

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:10]** And they're kind of heavies, and you all did a good job taking them out.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:23]** But in the process, you have to explore the rest of the medbay and the prison brick, sorry.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:33]** And that exploration puts you on the back foot as the elevator comes up, and Orgat, and Hesper, and Eil...

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:38]** are attacking you because now they are where you were.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:45]** They're in the open area and you all are in the single file hallway with three rooms along the hallway.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:48]** That was a tough fight, tactically tough.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:52]** Orgott was the one who decided to come forward and be

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:57]** Moving into the hall, Eyal and Hesper backing up.

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:05]** And just through attrition and through some sometimes moves that coordinated, sometimes they didn't.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:08]** It's tough to work together as a group sometimes.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:12]** You finally take down Orgat.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:16]** in this most recent turn.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:16]** And who did that?

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:20]** Of course, Brick19, the Murderbot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** But non-lethally.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:23]** Right, exactly.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** I don't like the title Murderbot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** I don't like it.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** You have a lot of work to undo, unravel that.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:32]** You have a lot more work to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** I have been keeping tabs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** You should hire a PR firm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:40]** On our D&D game, John used to actually tally up all the kills.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:45]** And I think, I think Gwen was actually more murderous than Rick's ever been.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** I'm just saying.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** Gwen was my D&D.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:51]** Well, I mean, it's all like, it sounds like Kevin, the murder bot or Rick.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** It's all.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:52]** Right.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** I know the common element is Kevin here.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** So is that it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** Never going to escape this.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:57]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** Let's be real.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** Along the way, I have to say, Dr. O.K.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:03]** planted in place, was scared.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:07]** But as you said, you got over it, setting up an awesome trap.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:12]** Colin moving back and forth between rooms, trying to take shots.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:17]** Here's also trying to stay in that second room and casting.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:20]** And then Bernice and Melt the Man.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:22]** trying to back up where they can.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:29]** I know Bernice was your remote ally, Dr. Okay, which was really cool to see you controlling Bernice, and that would be a lot of your turn.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** It was neat.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** And also Kaniko.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** Kaniko trying to help out where she can.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:38]** Sometimes butting heads with Rick19 a little bit.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** Kaniko's definitely a leader.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:42]** Rick19's trying to call the shots.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:45]** Kaniko's also trying to make shots, but...

**[00:17:45 - 00:18:09]** seems like things have maybe gelled maybe this is a turning point we're gonna jump back into that combat back into rick 19's turn as i go to turn on the combat mu zach and as i do i believe rick we talked about this before you have a move action left i thought i did a full attack that's what i remember

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:12]** You literally just told me before this that you had a movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:12]** I know, I'm kidding.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** I was trying to play like a kid, remember?

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:18]** No, I did the improved unarmed strike.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:26]** If anyone wants to argue that, yes, I said that Rick reached forward and tripped, but technically his hands are both on the two-handed weapon.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:32]** If you really want to think about it in your heads, Rick flung his foot around and kicked her.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:34]** Cause he's that athletic.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:35]** Nope.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** But it was my, that was my standard action.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:39]** And I think from, I'm just not going to move.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** I'm going to stay right where I'm at.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:44]** Cause I have a long range weapon.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** I'm good to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** Okay.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:57]** Rick still planted at the end of the hall on arm strikes or got who had moved down the hall to take out Rick 19 question for, I believe it is Colin.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:01]** What happens to the wisp spell that is on Rick?

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:02]** Orgon.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:06]** Does it just stay and you move it to a new person?

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:08]** New attacker.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:10]** Because it was on Orgon and Orgon's down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:12]** It was on Orgon and Orgon's down.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:15]** I can direct it as a move action on my turn to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:15]** On your turn.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:16]** Cool.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** Just want to make sure.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:19]** Wasn't sure if I should get rid of that or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** Cool.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:20]** Nope.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** Still there.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:21]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:23]** Love it.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** It is the end of Rick Dice Teen Turn.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** You know whose turn it is next.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:29]** Good old Dr. Contu Ocatas.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** What you doing in your corner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:39]** I'm going to instruct Bernice to try and draw the rest of them into this room because I'm worried about her and her.

**[00:19:40 - 00:20:04]** uh faculties so i'm gonna she's gonna come up to the uh the first yeah the room that keniko was in the the first room after the lounge yeah okay got it yeah and then come in love it and post up in the corner okay and i think that's all the movement i have and okay so yeah i guess um

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** Ready and action.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:14]** If somebody comes into the door frame here, the little fire off around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** Okay.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:21]** So you're going to ready an action to fire off around if someone comes in the door frame.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** And you mean crossing the threshold?

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** Because Colin is right there.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** Is here.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** Okay.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** Come into that first thing.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:30]** Yeah.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:34]** I'm going to shoot through the door with Bernice.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:43]** To draw their gaze into the room so that maybe they'll come to breach the room and then I'll sneak attack is my plan.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:43]** Okay.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** That I probably shouldn't have told you about.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** It's okay.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** It's all good.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** They have their own tactics.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** They don't know what's going on.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** I'm going to play fair.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** You're all good.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** You're all good.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** That's my turn.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** Thanks, Kelly, for that vote of confidence.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:58]** That is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** The nature of being a DM, I feel like you never know, you know?

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** It's a question of, like, one wonders.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** One does.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:07]** One does wonder.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:10]** A question for the sages, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** Yeah, thanks for that inspiring confidence in my skills.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** I trust you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** I don't trust Kevin as a GM.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** Anyway, let's go.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Say again?

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** Don't.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** You just roped Kevin into this.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:19]** I don't know.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:23]** Kevin's a true GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Kevin did a great job.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** N plus one to Fox.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** That's all I got to say.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** Plus one to Fox, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** What a good time.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** What a good time.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:39]** Bernice runs in between Colin's feet and Dr. OK readies

## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:11]** The family guy spoof of Star Wars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:14]** The scene where R2-D2 pulls out a pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:19]** That's exactly it.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** That's exactly it.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:23]** Alright, it is Bernice's turn.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** Bernice already went.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** It's Dr. O'K's turn.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** It is now Hesper's turn.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** In the back of the lounge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:37]** You hear Hesper say, Eyal, what should we do?

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** Ogat is down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:44]** And you hear Eyal say, cover me.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:58]** And so Hesper is going to, I believed they used, what do I want them to do with their awesome turn?

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** Oh, I know exactly what they're going to do.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:10]** They are going to do covering fire on ale.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:12]** Makes sense.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:17]** And since I'm working on one screen here, I'm going to go over and do an attack roll.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:19]** Boom.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:22]** They are firing forward.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:33]** And as they start to aim around the hall and aim down at Rick 19, then some of the shots, none of the shots go into the hallway.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:38]** They are not able to successfully do a covering fire against Ale.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Ale doesn't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** It's because Rick is prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:47]** And Rick, none of the shots whiz by you or hit down the hall.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:50]** So you're like, there's no way that they can hit me.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** Makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** I am invincible!

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** I am invincible!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:54 - 00:24:00]** And they are going to step forward about 20 feet.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** Not to spoil it.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:04]** Spoiler alert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:07]** The statute of limitations on that expired like two decades ago.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** But how does he die?

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** I didn't say that.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:10]** That's fair.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:11]** Ooh.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:12]** Nailed it.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** Live by the sword, die by the sword.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** That's all I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:19]** Well, he died by the Nigerian tank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:23]** Ale walks forward 15 feet.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:26]** And I just hit my camera.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:28]** That's how much he walks forward.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:31]** I'm going to adjust my camera here because that was cool.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** That's never happened before.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:45]** Walks forward, drops the squad machine gun, and is going to pull out their storm hammer, step around the corner, and take a swing at Colin Eden Brand.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:47]** I think I would fire first.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:50]** You don't get to fire first with a ready action.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** Is that right, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:51 - 00:25:18]** uh if your action is defensive well right if it's so what you're doing here it sounds like is a move action and then a standard action to attack yes yes at the end of his move action then dr okay would get to take his readied action in response to the move action i'd agree to that because you're moving into the square that was the trigger that was the trigger because there are two actions your action in the standard action


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:22]** I don't agree with this.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:26]** I'm considering letting it go because I want to get to it.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:30]** But I feel like the intent is to attack.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:33]** The intent is to come around the corner and hit you.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:36]** It's not a walk up, turn, and hit you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** So, I don't know that I agree with that.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:41]** Are you attacking the whole length of your movement?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:49]** No, but I'm stepping into the movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:56]** Like, as soon as a corner of your armor came into picture...

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:59]** Bernice was readying to fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** Just, yeah.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** It's also a GM call.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** Like if you want to say he attacks first and then gets shot, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:08]** It does change your initiative count, which we always forget.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:14]** Um, if you're ready, action is purely defensive, such as choosing the total defense action.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** The foe you are facing shoots at you.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** It occurs just before it is triggered.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** If a ready action is not, I think it was just delay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** I'm sure it was just delay.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:27]** Cause I don't like, I'm trying to, it kind of falls the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** Yeah.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:32]** Delay, I think, would be different, which is where you don't set a trigger.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** You just decide when you want to come out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:37]** If you delayed, you'd come after his turn.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:41]** But if you're doing ready, I think ready, your trigger is the move action.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** And he moved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:42]** Yeah.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:51]** Based on the way that I'm reading it and setting the precedent that if that's what you want to set your trigger as, I'd rather have it be that you can get specific with the trigger.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:51]** Right.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:54]** Rather than just say the overall move together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** And so you come just to just to go a little further.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:04]** It does say that the example is if your trigger is I'm going to shoot if the foe shoots at you, then it takes place after the event.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:04]** Right.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** But I wasn't right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** But the trigger was to wait till they moved.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** And so I think this would fall under.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** That's fine.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:13]** So you get your shot off, Bernice, first.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:23]** As soon as Ael's head comes into view, as soon as their body comes into view, then you are able to get your shot off.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** Big money.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:26]** And what do you do?

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** As one does.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:30]** Yo.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** It's yeet time, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:35]** Natural 20.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:37]** Natural 20.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:38]** Rad.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** I do not have the cards on me.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** Given my current situation.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** I'll just do the double.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** Well, is there any crit effect with the weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:48]** Let me double check.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:52]** It is the vapor cavitation pistol.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:56]** I believe it does have... Let's look it up.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:57]** Pulse.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** Pulse is the crit effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** Yeah, I think pulse is just the weapon.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** No, I don't think it has a crit effect.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Yeah, pulse, 1d4.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** Oh, so it's an extra 1d4?

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:08]** Yeah.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:18]** All creatures adjacent to the original target take an amount of damage listed in the pulse entry of the same type dealt by the weapon's initial attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** Sorry, Benny.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** Sorry, Dr. Rocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** Yeah.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:24]** Was not expecting that.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:30]** So you do, you roll twice, add your modifier both times, and then your d4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** Can I put us in a world of shit?

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** Okay.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:43]** So since all creatures adjacent would include the one that's been downed by non-lethal damage, is this pulse considered lethal damage, and do they need to start rolling deaths?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:46]** Oh, if it's a pulse, it's probably not lethal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:50]** Are you attacking non-lethally, Dr. O'Keefe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** I didn't determine that.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:53]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:57]** I'm giving you an option if that's what you were trying to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Are you going to flip a coin?

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** Is that what's going to happen?

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** Should I?

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** There we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:09]** It pulses out the same damage type as the weapon's initial attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** Yes.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:15]** And I rolled... I flipped a coin and I lost.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:18]** So I think I should do lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** So you do lethal damage.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:22]** Bernice was not considering that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** She doesn't know her own power.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** She's the real murder bot.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:29]** All creatures adjacent to the target.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:30]** That's it.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:34]** You can now put that in your PR campaign.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:37]** So I did...

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:41]** So do I roll the pulse twice or just the regular damage twice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:45]** I think you roll the regular damage twice in edger modifiers.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:45]** Yeah.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:50]** And then you would roll your critical ones because it deals that extra 1d4.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:53]** The question is, does it deal the extra 1d4?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:54]** What?

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** It says times two pulse.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:58]** I don't know what that means.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** Range crit times two.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:03]** Yeah, crit times two, and then you get the pulse ability.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:06]** So times two is your times two of your... Plus the pulse.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** You add in the 1d4.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:12]** Okay, so that's... The question is, I think Aeol would take the 1d4 as well, correct?

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:16]** Because it's... Or pulse says to everybody around you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:22]** Yeah, so I think it's just the pulse part that gets dealt to Aeol and Colin and myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:24]** That's the impression that I get as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** Wait, sorry.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** I missed that.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:29]** So Ale's going to take the two times damage from the regular.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** Does Ale take the 1d4?

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:32]** Yes.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:32]** I would think so.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:33]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:35]** That makes sense.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:38]** But everyone that's adjacent also just gets the pulse damage.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** Right.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:39]** Exactly.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:40]** Yep.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:40]** Cool.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** Okay.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:46]** So the total damage from the two rolls of 1d6 is six.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** I got a four and a two.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** And then the pulse damage was two.

**[00:30:51 - 00:31:00]** So eight total to a vole and two to myself, two to the corpse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:04]** Two to the unconscious Ludvija.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:06]** What does this attack look like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:18]** Yeah, it looks like a fiery bolt of lightning coming from a briefcase, just sort of emanating next to this sort of... She's at the foot of this bed.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** Yeah.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** In the infirmary.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** And so it just looks like a bright flash.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:34]** And then suddenly just this bolt of sort of fiery lightning just bursts out and singes Colin and Dr.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:35]** O.K.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:37]** 's body.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:37]** Skin a bit.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** Wow.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:39]** Rad.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:46]** And Aeol's black hair with the vapor just starts to float up in a static electricity way.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:51]** And they look like they took some pretty good damage with that.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:57]** Colin, you do notice that the lightning does arc to Ludvaia's body.

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:03]** And Ludvaia's body looks like it has gone from stable and unconscious to...

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:06]** The thing is here, I... So do I move an initiative?

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:10]** NPCs don't typically... Yes, but one sec.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:15]** NPCs don't typically get any, like... If they're down, they're down.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:19]** So I think you've killed Firespitter.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:32]** That's what I'm... I mean, they did attack you, but there's no... There's no mechanic for an NPC if they go down non-lethally, or if they go down lethally.

**[00:32:33 - 00:33:00]** I mean I could I think Dr. Okay would stabilize them if you notice there's no chance mechanically there's nothing there I want to give you all a certain like probably like one round in which they are dying and that's it that feels like the right thing to me to cast a cantrip to stabilize right well it's not your turn yet

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** You can't do it yet.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** But your turn will move now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:05]** In turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:09]** Your initiative order does change.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** It is not currently your turn.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:16]** So you basically give up your turn in order to move in the initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:18]** But technically...

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:43]** bernice is or operates on his turn and she delayed but so you're you can't though you you would have to give up your turn you give three actions basically with the drone right so the three actions being on your action i'm trying to understand it so you get a move action a standard action and so and bernice gets one or one or the other but then you can give up one of yours to let her do both

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:43]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** Which one do you have to give up?

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:46]** Yeah.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** I have to give up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:50]** So I can give her a directive.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:59]** So we're talking about if you can cast a spell as well as... Because you've used your action to ready an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:59 - 00:33:59]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:13]** Here's my argument, is that technically the three actions that he gets operates on the same turn, and he readied off of one of those three actions, and he never took the third action.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:18]** So it would move him to initiative order, he would take the action, and then it's basically his whole turn again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** You know what, though?

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:24]** I don't think I can move Bernice, which I did last turn and readied that action, so I think my turn's over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:28]** Yeah, I mean, you wouldn't now get...

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:38]** because ale still hasn't taken their turn, but now you're going to go right before ale this whole time, which I moved you correctly, but now you're going to go right before them, right?

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** That's the guess.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:40]** Yeah.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:41]** Yep.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:44]** You moved me an initiative after them.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:44]** Yep.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:45]** I need to fix that.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** But the point is that you have updated that.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:54]** So we're sure that you are not going to, you don't have anything else to do on your turn.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** Yeah.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** Okay.

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:02]** Okay, but I will say for one round, Ludvaia is dying.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:06]** And Colin, you noticed that since you were the only person who has line of sight to Ludvaia.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** Rick19, I feel like you're far enough away.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:19]** But still, a good round to deal more damage to Aeol, because Aeol and Hesper don't have a lot of damage to either of them right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:27]** It does say, as a move action, you can directly control your drone, which gives them the move action and a standard action.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** So he would still technically have a standard action left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:31]** So then I do have a standard action left.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** If it was his turn.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:34]** But it is my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** It's not your turn.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:38]** You readied an action.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Because readying an action, though.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:42]** Readying an action is doing something on somebody else's turn.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:46]** And you can ready an action as part of your turn to be used later.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:50]** But you can't then take the rest of your turn at that time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** Yeah, that makes sense.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** So then I don't move in initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** No, you still move in initiative order.

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:00]** Because your readied action was triggered.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** That's one of my biggest frustrations with readied action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** Yeah, that's why I don't like them anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:13]** And to be fair, it says when you can prepare to take an action when a certain trigger occurs by using a standard action.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:17]** So you have used your standard action to ready an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** No, he used Bernice's standard action to ready an action.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:25]** He had two standard actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:27]** So you just didn't take your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:28]** Yeah.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:28]** Basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** You didn't let him take his turn.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:31]** No, it's not on me.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:34]** I feel like you just didn't take your turn, which is okay.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** It's fine.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** I want you to have your turn.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** That's fine.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** Whatever.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:41]** I don't think that you did anything more with your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:51]** So if I knew that I would actually attack this person with my tactical syringe fear because he's within range, but I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:51]** Right.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:53]** But he wasn't there when it was your turn.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** Exactly.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:55]** Exactly.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** So you didn't do anything.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:00]** But you could have read your second standard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** I would have done that.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** So, sure.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** So, question.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:11]** We're already past that, so I think we'll just leave that where it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** But this is an interesting question for the rules paralegals.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:15]** Can you ready two actions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:19]** With a drone and a person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:22]** Yeah, that's, you know, hop into the Discord and tell us what you think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Yeah, rules paralegals?

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:52]** anyway that's a good question ask him now i mean they're really they're really responsive you can ask him now i think it's always worth asking them during the episode so doctor okay uh to be clear the question is can you ready actions of two different people at the same time well is that right the same character rendering readying two actions for a drone and for a player


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** I'd even argue they're not even the same character.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** They're technically two separate entities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:57]** Yeah, they are.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** But you right now technically act on the same initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** True.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** I think it's a gray area.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:04]** It's a real gray area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:14]** Yeah, Finder also has, with the rules as written, highly doubt, but he'd let it happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** Okay, so what did Finder come back with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** He said he'd let it happen.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:21]** It doesn't have a solid answer.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** I don't think anyone does.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** I don't think it's a... Yeah.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** Maybe we've wandered into uncharted territory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:28]** I think we have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:30]** I kind of like this uncharted territory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:30]** This is good.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** It's interesting.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:33]** We could set a precedent now, you know?

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** It could be you, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:38]** Yeah, but I mean, I don't want to retroactively do it.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** I was under the assumption that I couldn't.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:43]** Adam's typing now, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:44]** Yeah.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:55]** I mean, I think so, to be clear, because I also thought it was the case that Bernice either had a move or a standard and you, Dr. OK, have a move and standard.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:02]** If I don't move, I can give Bernice double your standard.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:05]** Yeah, I can give Bernice a standard, which I'm not moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:08]** Adam just came back and said, I think you can, actually.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:13]** You can have them act on two separate initiatives.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:13]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:18]** As a standard action, you were readying an action.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** And they both have a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** So Bernice can ready an action.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** And Dr. O.K.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** can ready an action.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:25]** Okay.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** All right.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:26]** That makes sense.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:29]** Well, in that case...

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:33]** Well, the thing is that I think we've already moved past that retroactively here.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** That's my thought.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** Have we though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** What is anything?

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** What is anything?

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:46]** I'm, I'm just trying to say that you didn't, you didn't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** Yeah, no, I didn't say it then.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** You're right.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** I didn't say it then.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** I would have.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** That's all that I'm trying to say.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:51]** Yeah.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** You actually confused.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** You initially confused.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** Is readying the action.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** Not Bernice.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:58]** Oh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** I did.

**[00:39:59 - 00:39:59]** You're right.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:03]** Because I didn't know that you could have them be different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:07]** I don't think that drones can take a rated action until the 20th level.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Oh, really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** Is that what you're saying on Reddit?

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:10]** That's what I'm saying on Reddit.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** Really?

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** I don't know why.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** This is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** According to random dude on Reddit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:17]** Let's just retcon it, then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:24]** So then, because the reaction would be, the readied action would be you instructing Bernice to fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:25]** Exactly.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:31]** Because I don't think she can act independently until that level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:36]** So then as soon as you heard them and they came around the corner... I wouldn't have done that if I didn't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:40]** Like, if I couldn't give Bernice a directive to do that, I would...

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:44]** that would just not have, I would have, wait, no, I think that's what Benny is saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:49]** Benny is saying you, you're ready to action is that like, you can do that.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:52]** Cause that's, that's how you originally, that's not how I would have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** Right.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:58]** What, what I think Will is saying is he readied Bernice's action to respond independently of Dr. Okay.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:03]** And had he known that limitation, he would have done a different, he would have done his turn differently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:03]** Yeah.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:04]** Got it.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:04]** Sorry.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:07]** I'm, I'm misunderstanding things left and right here.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** So, okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:09]** Well,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:15]** So that being said, I think we're pretty far.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:20]** Like now we know moving forward that you can't do that, but you still might be able to act independently.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:22]** This is we're in a big gray area here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:33]** Well, I think for now we can either retcon it where I just take a ready to action and Bernice doesn't.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:35]** And I mean, that's actually preferable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:39]** I am in favor of the fact that you already dealt damage.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:43]** but maybe you dealt damage to everybody else and you didn't want to do that.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:46]** So it's like, you would rather not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:50]** Yeah, I mean, it's against the rules for me to have done that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:54]** All right, so then it said you would have readied an action, so then...

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:57]** Dr. OK and Colin didn't take two points of damage.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** Let's rewind the clock.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:02]** Ludvia... It's still stable.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:04]** Ludvia is still stable.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:06]** Going to go back to Dr. OK's turn.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** Ludvia is still stable.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:14]** Dr. OK readied an action to attack with your... What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:18]** Tactical syringe spear with the... Got it.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:21]** The paralyzing agent.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:21]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:21]** OK.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** What did you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** 16.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Back on track.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:26]** 16.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** The question is, I'm going to say it.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** Do you have soft cover from Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** I think you do.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:34]** Yeah.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Okay.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:36]** Misses.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** Something about Colin being in the way.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:41]** Can't quite get that hit in.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:47]** Actually, I'm attacking from...

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** Stealth.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** Why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:51]** You are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:53]** You are.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** Remind me again what that would give us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** I think it's like a plus four or something.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** Attacking from hiding.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:07]** I am just forgetting things left and right here, so I'm just going to lean on you all here.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:09]** It's only if I'm...

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:12]** They are considered flat-footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** Oh, that's what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:16]** I was hoping it would reduce the AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:24]** Well, I mean, flat-footed in Starfinder is... Does that not reduce the AC?

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:26]** Yeah, it does by two.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** There's cover.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** Are you attacking lethally or non-lethally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:33]** Well, it's non-lethally with the injective thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:37]** Oh, right, because you've got the antidote loaded up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:59]** yeah ah that's right you got the antidote okay so i don't think it would be a negative to the no no there's there's no negative they get a minus two because they're flat-footed then then there's the cover the soft cover which is plus four right still no that doesn't hit still no dice on that

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:03]** Now, is that just a – that's a melee, right?

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** That's not you shooting it.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** That's a melee.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** You're trying to hit them, right?

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** So, yeah.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** So, you don't waste the vial.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** The vial is still good.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** It's still in the injection.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** Right.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** It's still in the ejector.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** Okay.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Cool.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:18]** That is a proper use of Dr.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:18]** O.K.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** 's turret after all this.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:22]** I'm glad that we went through all those rules, though.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** We got some things sussed out.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** We'll have to log that.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:25]** Cool.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** Thank you, Dr. OK.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:28]** Thanks for sitting through all those rules.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:29]** That was good.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:30]** It's good to work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** Thanks to everybody.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** You had to wait as well.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** And, you know, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** No, no, no.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:35]** It's good.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** Yeah.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:37]** All right.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** So that was Dr. OK's turn.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** You have moved in the initiative order.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:45]** You are now right before Ale.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:51]** And it is now going to be Ale's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:55]** Before you do that, sorry, I just want to get this out clear.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** Every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** It's all the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:09]** Reading Limited AI, which is under the mechanics class, it says that a drone can take a move action or a standard action to attack.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** So it's very specifically a standard action to attack.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:17]** And so technically drones can't do anything other than attack with their standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:20]** Okay.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** I can't do skill checks.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:27]** I'd argue skill checks, but we'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:32]** What I think we've established before is that the drone itself can't do skill checks.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** You can do skill checks through the drone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** Why does it have a skill modifier?

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:43]** Because on using master control, you give them master control, then they can do a standard action.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:50]** They can do any standard action, which would then include a readied action, which is back in the same boat as before.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** Anyways...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:54]** Wait, so you're saying if they have master control, they can't do a redaction?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:59]** If, like, you as the mechanic are taking master control of the drone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:05]** Master control is the term where you give up a move action in order to give the drone a standard action animation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:05]** So I could do it.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:08]** Now this is getting hairy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** It's complicated.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** We'll go back and read all this stuff later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:11]** It's good, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** We'll figure it out.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:12]** Good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:14]** Will this episode air?

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:17]** Find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:23]** Will any of this episode air or will it just be a big cut?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:23]** No, it will all air.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** It's good stuff.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** Where can we go?

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** So many transition stingers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:30]** So many transition stingers.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** We might just let it sit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:33]** I really like Morph Cut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** What's Morph Cut?

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:35]** I don't know what Morph Cut is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:36]** It's a transition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** So if my head's here and it's over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:42]** Yeah, it does what you think it does.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** Yeah.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** Like the Batman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** Colin Eden brand.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:57]** AL steps around the corner, narrowly missing an injector needle from Dr. OK.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:03]** And as that is happening, tries to swing, but is thrown off balance.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:11]** So their diamagnetic storm hammer just hits the door next to you, almost about to swing into your face.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:16]** But they were knocked off balance as they rolled a 10 to hit you.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:21]** And that is finally the end of Eyal's turn.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** Good stuff.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** We made it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:25]** We made it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:28]** And we found out and learned some things along the way.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** It was great.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:32]** Kiers, what are you doing with your turn?

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** Good Lord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:35]** All right.

**[00:47:35 - 00:48:03]** uh can hear us talk to melt a man and then like ask him um like uh hip good lord uh what's that thing called tele telekinesis can he do that with melt a man can you talk to can't talk man you guys are really throwing the good questions in uh i i don't see why not but do they have thoughts that you can register i guess bernice does bernice has i mean multiman has its own pressure

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:06]** So not Melt-A-Man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:07]** I think you could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:09]** Do robots dream of electric sheep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** I think you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:17]** Can I get a response from Melt-A-Man and then just keep doing my thing?

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:19]** I can have short little conversations.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** I think we've established that before.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:22]** Just real quick feedback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:30]** It's pretty quick, but you're getting close to using a move action to talk if you're waiting and asking a question.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:32]** What are you saying?

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** What are you asking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:33]** Melty man.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:41]** Here's just wants to, to tell Melty man to like, just non-lethally take out the nearest enemy.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:43]** And also where are they?

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** Because here's can't see.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:48]** And he wants to go around and like, hopefully there's one in the hallway.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** He doesn't know what's going on.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:54]** He's in this room tucked all cutely in the little prison room.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:57]** And he, he wants to come out and do something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:04]** Okay, I think that Melted Man probably says and thinks the same things at the same time.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:11]** So Melted Man is going to say, I will take them out non-lethally, and I cannot see where they are.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:17]** Because they're in... My follow-up question would be, well, where are you?

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:21]** I am in the second med bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:23]** That's as many questions as you can ask.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:23]** Sorry.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** I mean, dang it.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:28]** I mean, geez, golly, YouTube.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:28]** All right.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:31]** So here's is going to this really sucks.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:33]** But at least here's could tell him what to do.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:35]** So here's goes into the hallway.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** It's going to go into the hallway.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:38]** He's going to try to short circuit.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** That's not actually the right term.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:43]** He's going to try to daze an enemy, which is hopefully in the hallway.

**[00:49:43 - 00:50:08]** okay so here's goes into the hallway excellent he sees the able yeah okay uh and then he's gonna cast uh days i think it's what it's called yeah okay now now what do i need to make for 15 we'll save dc 15 don't pass okay cool

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:09]** All right.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** Yeah, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:10]** No, definitely.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:11]** Definitely.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:11]** We'll just not.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** We'll just not pass all your worst.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** Your worst.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:14]** Yeah.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** I'll roll my worst.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:23]** You see them slam the hammer and then they don't move.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:25]** They seem to be dazed.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:29]** So you can't take an action next round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** Oh, OK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** OK.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** Short circuited.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:58]** nice i like it boom here's uh satisfied goes back into the room because he can you can move cast and move move cast you can you took that we established that we could do that no you took the same feat that colin took what is the name of the feat i thought that was a global thing nope that's a feat agile casting what's it called uh agile casting

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** I don't see it.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:03]** Looks like yours is chilling out in the hallway still.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:04]** All right.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:08]** Behind two forces of death.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** In between, I should say.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:11]** There's Kevin, and then there's this other thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** Can't you shoot between his legs, Kevin?

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:16]** I thought we established last time that I wanted all of you guys out of the hallway.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:21]** It was just for like one second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:21]** I'm sorry.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** It's good.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:24]** I thought I could move, cast, and move.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** I thought I could do that.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:27]** I'll keep that in mind from now on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:30]** Will we get to the end of this combat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:31]** Never.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** Never.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** Stay tuned.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:33]** Never.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:36]** Kyrs, do you want to do anything else with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:39]** I think Kyrs is already infringed upon the rules enough.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** I don't think he can do anything else.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** He moved to Kassadin.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:44]** He had a short conversation with Meltaman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** You can apologize to Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:47]** I'm sorry, Rick.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:50]** Can you shoot between my legs very, very carefully?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:54]** You'll just, you know... Take a minus four to do it.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:55]** All right.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** That's fine.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:56]** All right.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:57]** Let's see.

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:02]** It is Kaniko Breeze's turn.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:05]** Kaniko is understanding that Rick19, you're playing into the hallway.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:12]** She doesn't want to move and take up space, especially since...

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** That would be tactically not great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:18]** She's also aware that cover can't stack at this point.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** It's already there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** At this point, it doesn't matter.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** Well, she doesn't see here's in the hall.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** That's all I'm saying.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** Yeah.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:30]** So, 50-50, would she go in?

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** I think...

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:42]** Hearing the clang from Aeol, I think she is going to step out, and she is going to fire at Aeol with her tactical rotating pistol.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Which is pretty great.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** That sounds dope.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:49]** Yeah, like a minigun, but at a pistol.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:50]** Yeah, it's pretty rad.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:55]** Not gonna... Let's find out.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** Oh, wow.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:58]** It's a great roll.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:00]** 25 to hit.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:11]** She is definitely hitting Ale, and that is going to be 2d4 plus 4 damage to Ale.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:17]** Yeah, so that's 9 damage to Ale, who is dazed, standing in the hall.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:21]** And even non-lethally, that would still hit.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:23]** She is, of course, attacking non-lethally.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Wow.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:41]** Getting down to his last legs, you see the human soldier heavy with the crazy storm hammer start to look defeated as they're looking around, confused, not sure, not able to take in all the stimuli that's happening at once.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:43]** There's shots from Ale.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** There's the clang of the hammer.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:48]** There's the injector needle that just went in front of their face.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** There's all those discussions about rules.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Their heads are swimming.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:54]** They don't know how to think about anything right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:56]** You can't do that.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:00]** You can't move and cast and move.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:03]** We're like calling the rules paralegals in our little like, you know, like things.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:13]** How did this gaggle of morons manage to make it this far?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:15]** I'm sure that's what they're thinking right now.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:19]** Let the greys have him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** Let the greys kill him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** I'm sure they'll be... Kill the fucking greys.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:23]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** They're all just, like, sweat-dropping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:29]** Yeah, that is Kaniko Breeze's turn.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:33]** It is not Orgat's turn, who is unconscious and...

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:36]** Back to the top of the round.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** It is Colleen Brand's turn.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** What are you doing?

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:42]** You got a dazed human heavy in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:44]** I'm going to take the obvious choice.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:49]** I'm going to use my stabilize level zero spell on Orgat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:50]** Why?

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** You don't need to.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:52]** Oh.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:53]** They're not.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:57]** Four got stable and Ludwia is stable because we retroactively.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:57]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** Bernice did not fire.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** She did not murder anyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** She didn't murder anybody.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:04]** Bernice.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:06]** Even though that crit was cool.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:06]** To be fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** Yeah, whatever.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:09]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** I wanted you to have that cool crit, but I realized why you didn't.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** Anyway, sorry, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:13]** Cool.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:17]** Then I'm going to shoot Ludvaia.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:18]** Excuse me, Eivor.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:19]** What?

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:20]** I'm going to shoot Eivor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:21]** Savage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** Wow, I'm really great with names, I promise.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:31]** I'm going to shoot Eivor with my needler pistol with the antidote.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:59]** the antidote okay and i think at dazed you can take no actions which i would assume also means take no reactions so a reaction i think is a type of action it it's it is indeed let's see don't miss don't miss don't miss so when the two and the zero are next to each other that's that's good right that's when you you've made it awesome


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:25]** yeah that's when you know so that's a natural 20 i shot him like right in the right in the carotid and so it's not legally right frank the tank and uh old school i have dude you just took a jar to the jugular man i haven't seen old school in so long wait i've never seen it wow it's okay it's okay i hear i've got a long flight ahead of me so i guess i'll download it watch that um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:26]** You should probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** Among other movies.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:31]** Yeah, I don't remember the properties for the antidote, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:34]** It's 4d10, not lethal damage, bro.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:38]** So you essentially did... I don't think that you would do 8d10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:41]** I think I would do 8d10.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:43]** Because I think I crit.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:48]** Can we just call him down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:49]** He's definitely down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:50]** Do the math.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:55]** No, but I mean, you could potentially roll ones on all of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:56 - 00:57:00]** Slash roll 8d10 plus the damage from my needler pistol.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:04]** No, 2d4 plus 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:12]** See, that's what I'm saying is that I feel like your needler pistol does the damage and the serum itself is like its own damage, right?

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:16]** Like you're not going to like there's no more serum in there.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** It's still 4d10.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** And he already looks pretty hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:25]** So the first 4d10s are 3, 6, 11, 14.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:34]** 14 plus 6 is 20.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** So 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** He's down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:39]** If we don't double the injector.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** He's down.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:42 - 00:58:03]** nice yeah yeah cool dang does my oh and like he he's hit with such force that like not only does the like he's passed out on his feet but like the force of the vial hitting him in the karate just like knocks him on his back

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:08]** Slams into the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:14]** Slides to the ground, knees up, falls over unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:16]** We hear him gently snoring so we know he's not dead.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:22]** Well, but he's dazed.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:24]** How long is he dazed for again?

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** I mean, he's half a round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Cool.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:32]** And then Colin's going to move back into the room to not be in the way.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:34]** Good round.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:37]** AO went down real quick.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:38]** Just hit after hit after hit.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:41]** Incredible hit from the tactical needle pistol.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:42]** I got one.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** Right in the carotid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** I hope he's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:49]** He looks like he's taking a nice long nap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** You know he's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** You know he's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** Good turn, Rick19.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** What are you doing?

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:57]** You've got two people in the hall.

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:00]** Well, I'm standing... And two unconscious bodies at the end of the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:05]** I'm on the grounds behind Hears, who just stepped into the hallway.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** Kaniko then stepped out into the hallway, too.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** Yeah.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:14]** He's got his artillery... His asthma artillery laser...

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:17]** primed and ready to shoot.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:22]** But since they stepped into the way, he actually kind of just slides it off to the side.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:25]** He's going to drop it, technically.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** Slides it off to the side.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:31]** And Kelly, roll me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:31]** Who?

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:32]** Me?

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:32]** Yeah.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:33]** Yeah.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:33]** Catch that.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:35]** Okay.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** We're going to do it.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** All right.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** Cut off for one second.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** All right.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:38]** Perception.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:42]** It is a 14.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:45]** I'm going to roll against that.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:47]** I pass.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** So you don't notice.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:51]** I pull out.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:56]** I seemingly pull out my pistol and it.

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:03]** Kind of morphs and stretches and changes into a pulse caster rifle.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:07]** Almost like builds itself.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** That's cool.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:14]** And with that, I'm going to take a shot.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:19]** I only need my minus four because a pulse caster is a non-lethal weapon.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:22]** So it's a plus five to hit.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:28]** That's a six on the die for a total of 11 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:35]** It's going to be a miss at the enemy who is a long ways away, but a good chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** A good try.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:41]** Does Sears have to roll perception to see your terrible miss, or does he just know because it's obviously fine?

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:47]** You know that you f***ed it up by standing in front of me.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** Would a 15 have hit, John?


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:50]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:50 - 01:01:00]** We'll put that right next to how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tizzy roll pop in unanswered questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** Kevin will never know.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:08]** That was a smart idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** It was a smart idea.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:10]** Who knows why that happened?

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:14]** You manifest this gun in front of you, take a shot past two people.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** Admittedly, a tough shot.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** So you were close.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:22]** It did make it all the way down the hall and seemed like it hit off to the left.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:24]** So you were in the right direction.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:26]** You were in the ballpark.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:26]** Good try.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:30]** It's going to be Hesper's turn.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:33]** They are the lone individual left.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:47]** left and they are going to seeing hmm would they do that because i think they saw kaniko attack ale

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:54]** And I think they are going to, but they also saw Colin take down Ale.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** That's it.

**[01:01:55 - 01:02:01]** So they are going to walk up and stand over Ale's body.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:11]** And as they're walking, you just hear them mumbling like, I'm just going to rip right to you and shoot you.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:21]** and just kill you, and you hear this coming down the hall, and then they step in front of the door, and they are going to fire at Colin Edenbrand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:22]** Come at me, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:26]** Oh, man.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:31]** That's 22 to hit against EAC.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:53]** believe that is a hit for nine points of electric damage from their static arc pistol right in front of you doctor okay this electric bolt slams in the column for nine points of damage call it whoa i don't say that out of nowhere

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:56]** Last stand.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:57]** It is going to be Dr.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:57]** O.K.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** 's turn.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:58]** What do you do?

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:58]** Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:00]** O.K.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:05]** 's going to take a swipe at Hesper with the tactical syringe spear.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:09]** Load it up with that 4D10 elixir.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:37]** yeah for night uh no actually let me do the math uh it's there's 19 on the die it's got a hit um 19 on the die is absolutely gonna hit yeah 23 yeah that's definitely hitting dang roll high bro roll high so i have to say they are uninjured so far wow okay

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:44]** So my regular damage, I got 11.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:46]** Ooh.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** Okay.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** And then 4d10.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:54]** 4d10, dude.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:56]** That's 8.

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** 8.

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:03]** And 12 for... 20?

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:03]** Yeah.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:10]** So 20 plus 11.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:11]** 31.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:18]** 31 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:40]** dang he steps up just takes out call it eden brand and you're like how do you move around the corner to hit him uh mostly like you you see like a ripple of it's very swift very uh stealthy action i would imagine

**[01:04:40 - 01:05:08]** all you see is kind of like the ripple of slime sort of vibrate a little bit and then just out of the corner of the corner that I'm in you see this spear just sort of with tentacles holding onto it like octopus like tentacles holding this spear around the corner kind of just right in the right in the neck right in the neck yeah Colin Colin


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** Yeah, he attacked Colin.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:19]** No, Colin, you see the serum just go into Hesper's body.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:30]** And you see, like, you can now see very quickly that, like, their veins just kind of, like, this, like, purple color just, like, moves through their veins.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:36]** And then they are angry and, like...

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:42]** And just fall face forward.
