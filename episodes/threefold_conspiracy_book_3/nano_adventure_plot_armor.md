## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:28]** Music Music


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:20]** I don't know what music this will be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:22]** This is so nice.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:23]** Hello.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:27]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast episode.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** NanoVenture.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** This is sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:33]** The one time I don't pull up to listen to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:38]** This music actually kind of gives me a little anxiety.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:44]** This is exactly what I would listen to when I was doing homework for my BA in business.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** It sounds...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:47]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** You got a deadline coming up?

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:54]** This is like, okay, I have to read eight chapters of textbooks.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** I have to do five quizzes.

**[00:01:55 - 00:02:03]** I've got to write four papers and some discussion board posts because that's how online classes work.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:08]** You have to interact in a forum, apparently, with a bunch of people who don't want to interact with each other, but whatever.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** That's true.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:11]** And I've got to make it home for dinner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:16]** I hate the classes that require you to respond to other people's things like they care and they're going to read it.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:23]** I had a couple of classes like that where you had to respond to two posts from someone else that week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:27]** And it was like, which I get it, right?

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:31]** Like they're trying to simulate your interactions in the classroom.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:35]** Like I absolutely believe in interpersonal interaction.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:38]** Like if you're in a room and you're having a debate, you know, I took a philosophy class.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** It was like,

**[00:02:39 - 00:03:00]** 8 p.m on thursdays and the discourse in that class was incredible you know we had some really good conversations and arguments and and you know that's fine but discussion boards aren't the same they're not even close to the same that way john likes venice right there right that's good


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** Yeah, I'm liking your thing that you said.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** Thank you, Kelly.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** Not the thing before we started recording.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** Because apparently that's not cool to like.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:12]** John laughed at Kelly's post about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:12]** This thing now.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** Like what you like, Kelly, but, you know.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:17]** I'm not going to like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:22]** I'm John Swan, and I don't make fun of people's personal lives.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:25]** I'm Kelly Gilliam, and this music, I changed my mind.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:35]** Though it is really good, it sounds like if you ever were on Newgrounds back in 2006 or whatever, it kind of sounds like some of the porn games that you would play on Newgrounds.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:40]** They would have this jazz in the background and be like... It's like Dating Sims, you know?

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** All right, never mind.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:44]** This isn't playing well.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:47]** I was like a 14-year-old kid or 13, okay?

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Cut me a break, but...

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** None of this is playing well.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** It sounds like Newgrounds games.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:54]** It kind of does sound like the Newgrounds loading screen.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** I know what you're talking about.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** I hear it now too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** Show of hands, who knows what Newgrounds is?

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** Yeah.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** Come on, Vinny.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** You know what this is.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Will knows what this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** You have to be kidding me.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:11]** That's bulls**t. It was a Flash game website where people can make their own Flash games and videos and put it up.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:12]** And then you would vote.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:16]** You actually got to vote for five brand new things a day.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:21]** And if you didn't get enough or a high enough grade, then your stuff was rejected from the website.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:24]** So if you pass, then you get your stuff put on the website.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:27]** Actually, I tried to submit something once, but I screwed up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:29]** I did, too.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:33]** Before YouTube was around, there was Newgrounds.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** The original internet memes, a lot of them were from Newgrounds.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:41]** So even stuff that's still around today came from that.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** But you wouldn't know.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:46]** And now I'm realizing that the crickets were because you didn't know what I was talking about, which makes me happier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:50]** A lot of video games, like the cup game that you played, John.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** What's that one called?

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:55]** The happy cup ones or the demons and all that stuff.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** The 2D scroller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** Oh.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** I'm looking.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** There's a dungeon crawler game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:01]** Yeah.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** Alien Hominid.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:08]** There's several games that started off as these flash games.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** Indie games?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:11]** They were independent.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** Not even independent games.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** They were Flash games.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:22]** People would build these games, put them on new grounds, and they grew to the point where they were then put on platforms like PlayStation and Nintendo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** From Adobe Flash.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:24]** Yeah.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:27]** Yeah, that's why it took forever for them to do.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** And nothing was ever super, super high quality as a result.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:31]** But there was this own look and feel to it.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:33]** There was also just straight up animations on there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** Some of it was super high quality.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:39]** There was a Mega Man X flash that was just phenomenal.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:42]** It was like post-apocalyptic.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** I loved it.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:47]** Anyways, the one thing I tried to do was my Kevster drawing.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:50]** I had him animated.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:53]** And the whole joke of it was subliminal messaging.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:59]** So he was trying to get the watcher to rate high.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** But he was saying like, hey, this is just a test.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:01]** I'm just trying it out.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:05]** And it was actually like I moved the lips and I voiced it out.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:10]** But I was having him pull cards up that said, please vote.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** Give me a five star or whatever.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:19]** It worked really well, and then, of course, every time I have a project like that, it gets corrupted, and I don't get to load it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** So you don't have it.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** It could be on the Wayback Machine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:27]** I could have been a professional animator at this point in my life, but no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:30]** I was waiting for Salad Fingers to come up, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Salad Fingers came from Newgrounds.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** This is good.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:39]** Also, Harry Pothead, back when Harry Potter first came out, there was a Harry Potter.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** It's all from Newgrounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:43]** I didn't watch Salad Fingers until, like,

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** four months ago.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:45]** Really?

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** For the first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** And you've seen Charlie the Magical Unicorn.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:52]** You've seen Shitty Five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:53]** You've seen, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:56]** All that originated on Newgrounds.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Charlie the Unicorn?

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:58]** Dude, I didn't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:01]** It's a magical little pluridone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:05]** You guys have played... You guys have been on Homestar Runner before, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** Dude, I love Homestar Runner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Homestar Runner.net


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:21]** I will say I do flash games.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** Give me an archery flash game.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:27]** And I would like everybody.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** That was my jam.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:34]** Victory beer for the V for vibes.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:41]** Victory is probably my favorite brewery recently because their variety packs are actually good.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** They're

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:44]** Their variety packs aren't just all IPAs.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** And there's also a citrus something.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:51]** Oh.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** He left again.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:52]** Yeah, he did.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:53]** He did.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** He's a different person.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** I can't keep track.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:55]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:56]** It's hard.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** He's a man of mystery.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** Man of mystery.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** All around the world.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** Where he is, who knows?

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:02]** No one will know.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** No one will know.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:10]** And it definitely won't be that, you know, he was assassinated like we talked about in one of our previous banters.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** It's because he's on the run.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** Kev, do you listen to Will Say the Podcast?

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:15]** Sometimes.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** Sometimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:19]** Do you like... Can I skip the banter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:22]** That's fair.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** It's okay.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** It's all good.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** I don't recall the assassination conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:32]** Kelly wisely said who in our Discord server would be assassins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:34]** Oh, that conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:36]** And I think we agree that it was Adult Friend Finder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:42]** Because he finds adults and maybe befriends them to murder them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** And he has path.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:44]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:49]** You spend $2,000 on a laptop and then like it.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:49]** Yeah.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:50]** All right.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:50]** Thanks.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** Welcome back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** You got to figure out how to use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:56]** No, it's a sound card for a second.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:57]** All right.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** There we go.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** That's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** All good.

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** Boo.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:00]** All right.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:03]** So who is running our plot armor this week?

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:04]** This time.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** This time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** Should we do an anonymous vote?

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:10]** I would like to anonymously vote.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** I also would anonymously vote Kevin.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:14]** No, we already knows Ghost did and Will won.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:19]** We were recording, so it wasn't real.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:24]** Now that this is recorded, no, no, no, no, no.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** It's for Kev.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:27]** Will, do you also anonymously vote Kev?

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** Yeah.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** Okay, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:38]** I feel like he has the most questions that are the most interesting, because this is his backstory, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:40]** I don't have the questions, because it's my backstory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:41]** Oh, man.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:48]** Okay, well, I mean... Well, I feel like for this first part it would make sense since Kev is the keeper of the notes.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:49]** He is.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** The keeper of the notes.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:54]** That doesn't frustrate Kev at all.

**[00:11:55 - 00:12:00]** I feel like an appropriate nice Christmas gift would be a nice leather-bound notebook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** Yeah.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:02]** I have a notebook.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** It's called the Gap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:10]** Yeah, that's true, which was a great... I'm telling you, whatever you write in it is canon.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:12]** That's how it works.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:15]** All right, Kev, so where did we begin?

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Let's flash back a few more.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:19]** I didn't pull up the notes this time because I thought Will was going to run it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** All right.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:27]** Listen, this all started a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** This all started.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** Do you want me to run it?

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:30]** I can run it.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** I can probably run it from memory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:32]** See?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:37]** So it started back in the lab.

**[00:12:37 - 00:13:01]** on uh whatever the the private base is hotel echo something or other right what are you talking about uh the stewards one tercalis yes the stewards and rick 19 is sitting in the the room and the sheeran lab assistant is checking his vitals and he shines a flashlight into rick's eyes

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:06]** And when that happens, we flashed to something.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:07]** It was literally a flashlight.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** Because it flashed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:11]** You flashed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** Strong side.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Strong side.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:14]** Yeah.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:17]** Flash us into this nano-adventure.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:20]** So then we cut to the introductions of all our characters.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:36]** The four of our four characters are then each in a lab of their own, and they're all being injected with nanites to be a part of a special team called STARS, which is the Special Tactics and Raids Squadron.

**[00:13:36 - 00:14:01]** uh and they're each required not required but recommended i guess i don't we didn't really get into the policy you did make it required yeah yeah well john made it required so it is it was a requirement it was absolutely required that you had to have at least one level in nanos i thought it was two yeah i did say one it was at least one level at least one which not all of you did


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:02]** Who chose one?

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** Because, Will, you did too, right?

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** Because it was a level four.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:08]** The sheet was for a level four character.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** Yeah.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:16]** And I encourage you to, as Will has said many times, to play outside the box that you normally play in.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:20]** And, yeah, at least one level had to be nanosite.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:20]** Question.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:24]** Why did you choose two or why did you choose one?

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** That's an open question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:37]** I mean, I chose two to try and take advantage of more nanosite properties, like class features.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:43]** I feel like in every combat you did, you always had the healing swarm that came up, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:47]** I think you used your nanites more than anybody else.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:50]** Yeah, I used them for defensive dispersal.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:52]** That's right.

**[00:14:53 - 00:15:05]** there's like a, like basically like a DR that you can run, which is kind of a neat, uh, class thing for like, uh, if you, if you want a durable character, which yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:10]** DR, DR boosts basically are like damage reduction.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Yeah.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:11]** Yeah.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** It's you.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:12]** No.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Yeah.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:21]** But like, it's not exactly a DR. Cause no, no, a different, it functions the same way you reduce damage, uh,

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:46]** buy a level plus your constitution and gain like um a circumstance bonus for your first save verse and effect for example which is a cool like statistical retry uh i like that i like that i like to not increase my chance of survival you you at least gain something the next turn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:53]** But would it survive the smash from a Cthulhu monster is the question, I wonder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:56]** We'll get there later on.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:59]** We'll get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:04]** I knew a little bit about the defensive dispersal because I had used it as Rick.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:08]** I don't know if you guys ever caught on to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:09]** I did.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** When I picked it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** That sounds familiar.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:30]** So some other things that we picked up on in that episode was we got to meet a Lieutenant Lua, who was the supply officer for the unit previously, and she had left the unit, but just came by to say hi.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** Is that correct, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:43]** Yeah, well, you all went from the lab where you get the nanobots injected, you fast forward a year, and then you're at a kind of an awards ceremony that includes an honorifics to you all, right?

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:47]** At the Morrow Museum of Natural History.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:49]** Okay, I'm mixing things up then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:53]** So at the lab, we meet Colonel Bolt, or Commander Bolt.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** Commander Bolt.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** Yeah.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:58]** And then we meet Lua at the... Okay, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:20]** uh does that cover everything in the lab then we all get our our yeah and i just want to say that you all did a great kind of snapshot as the nurses were talking to each of you and just kind of making sure that you're good everything it was just a great like little snapshot of each of your characters because you each had different reactions to like this pretty intense procedure

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:23]** That was the most intense of the series that you had gotten.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:28]** This was the largest, you know, injection of nanobots into your body.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:31]** And each of you had your own unique reactions.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** And that was really cool to see.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:36]** Just wanted to highlight you all for some good RP in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:39]** And then we cut flash forward.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:43]** In this flashback, we flash forward one year.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:48]** And we are then at a museum, the Mauro Akatonian Museum of Natural History.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:51]** And we're there for an event where... Mana.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** What?

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:54]** Nothing.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:54]** Go ahead.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** Oh, is that what it stands for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** Did you say mana?

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:58]** It was like an opening, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:01]** Or like a... It was just like a gala.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:04]** Little gala at the Museum of Natural History.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:04]** For what?

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** Like a fundraiser?

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:09]** It was billed as a fundraiser, right?

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:11]** Because let me look at my notes.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:15]** But as part of it, there were honorifics for us.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** That was kind of the big thing, right?

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:22]** Which if I go to my notes, I believe it was for, what was the name of the event?

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:22]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** I'll look into it in a sec.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** Keep going.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:25]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:27]** The Rings to Life auction.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** That's what it was.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Rings to Life.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:29]** Go ahead, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:37]** And while we were there, we as the stars team were being recognized for all the work we had done over the last six months to a year.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:46]** And they kind of explained that we as stars have been combating a series of kidnappings.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:53]** But these kidnappings are a little strange because every time we got to the crime scene,

**[00:18:53 - 00:19:08]** one or two people one of the two would be missing we would find either just the kidnappers or the victims the victims never both um and they just kind of vanished it wasn't like there was any kind of sign of an exit or anything like that um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:21]** I'm trying to think what else there were some, there were chances to, to kind of have a little fun RP moments, but the four of you played characters who are not really comfortable in those social situations.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:30]** So you did, however, I think go look at some swag, some ring work swag, and also the Mari Maro being a guessing game.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:33]** And there was some food in the back, but no one went, no one went to get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** Cause it was poisoned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:36]** For sure.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Yeah, for sure.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:37]** For sure.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** For sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:41]** But we did at that time meet the Raxalite Lieutenant Lua.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** We find out she was on our team.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:48]** She no longer is on the team, but she was in charge of supplies and weapons.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:58]** And one thing that we noted back then was Commander Bolt did make a comment for a better morrow and a better tomorrow.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:03]** And I think Vinny, you were the one that thought that was a little triggering.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** I thought that was hella fishy.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:07]** And we still don't know if Bolt is on our side or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** I think we know.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:15]** I think we know now that everyone's on the side of shoving us through that f***ing aperture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Meat grinder.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:18]** Which... That comes later.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** But we'll get there.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** Turn into anything.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:22]** But we'll get there.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** Or did it.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:24]** Or did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:25]** Uh...

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:30]** So, the Ringworks to Life auction starts, and what happened with Kif?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:43]** Well, another thing to note was just a couple other things, is that Ringworks financed our unit, which is actually a unit from the Goldvade Census, which Goldvade Census is a part of the Abadar Corps, correct?

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:45]** Yeah.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:49]** Is it a faction?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:54]** But they're like a majority donator and the whole thing.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** It's like any company.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:55]** You can go look and see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** Nothing suspicious at all.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:57]** No.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:59]** Anywhere in this entire adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:03]** What was their motive the whole time?

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:08]** Just to harness us and to gather our nanosites into this portal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** We'll get there.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:19]** So the other sponsors of this event, Gamut Bio, Humanitarian Aid for Akitan, and the non-profit Garden of Eden.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:27]** And then you all had a little intro from Leora Huxley, esteemed CEO.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** Leora Huxley.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** Yeah.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** That ish.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:33]** That was the end of the episode.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:38]** And so we come back into that episode and she is explaining herself.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** She's introducing herself.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** And while she is giving her speech...

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:48]** She is then taken captive by a masked individual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:50]** She's Leora abducts Lee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:52]** It lives.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** It keeps going.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:59]** It will always live.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** It will always live on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** And she's also very long winded all the time.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:06]** Because she still got out like a six-minute speech before getting kidnapped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** It wasn't that long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:11]** They're rolling with guns, and she's like, please, just a moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** Please, hold on.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:17]** I have practiced this for days, and I will not let you intervene.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** Oh, oh, oh, sorry.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Sorry.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:23]** My bad there, sorry.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:26]** How much longer do you...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:35]** And then as soon as that happens, there is several hostiles that come in from all directions, including a giant Velociraptor.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** Ah, I missed that guy.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** He was cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** I missed that guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:45]** And when we were playing, I wasn't certain if that was a bad guy or not.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:49]** So I was like, I'm going to just stand here with my pike out in case that thing comes at us.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** And sure enough, it came at us.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:51]** So we killed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** Yeah.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:52]** Yeah.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** That was a good time.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:53]** True.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** We'll say fashion.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** That was a good, uh, Hanukkah.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:59]** Yeah, that was sort of, that was a fun fight.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:06]** I will say that if I had to go back, I would not have included that many people in the fight.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** It was a lot of people to manage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:12]** Can you explain Ken Kara?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:13]** Uh, yeah.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:16]** King car was just a Lieutenant in the IFF.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:27]** Just a lower-ranking individual in the IFF who then, after you all soundly defeated them, was taken away for questioning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:33]** Did you intend for it to be like a replica of any way from Kara on our team, or was it just coincidence?

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** It was just coincidence.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** Okay.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Too much of a coincidence in this case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:41]** And also, like, taken away for questioning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** Yeah, by the team that backstabbed us.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** So we're going to see more of her.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:50]** Go out and get some burgers and fries and shakes.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:50]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** That's nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:55]** We got through that combat.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** We took out the bad guys.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:07]** And then Bolt lets us know over a round of shots that they have an emergency beacon on the Aura.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:11]** Which, again, this is looking back, this is all super suspicious.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** And we'll get to that.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** Um...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** I mean, you know, she sponsored it.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:19]** She should get some cool tech that you all have.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:25]** You don't just have emergency beacons laying around, you know what I'm saying?

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:26]** Yeah.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:26]** Suss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:35]** Yeah, I mean, I imagine Ringworks tomorrow is sort of the Lockheed Martin bowing of, like, that team.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:50]** In a way, I mean, the overall, like the canon for Ringworks, I think I mentioned it later on when you all got to a certain point in the warehouse, is that they have, they're one of the oldest Starship makers.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:58]** So they just have a huge fucking legacy from even before the gap of creating incredibly reliable.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:03]** And I think I said like one of their models is probably in every fucking hangar from here to the best.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:24]** you know what i'm saying and they like have such a storied history and you can imagine at this point that yeah they've they've that's that's their mainstream and they've definitely diversified a lot of their interests along the way you know so they're not just sideline anything but glock actually makes airplanes too right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:31]** They make three things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** That's all I'm going to say.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:38]** If somebody wants to know what those three things are, they can DM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:40]** Continue, Kevin.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:50]** So the assailants that invaded the event were part of the IFF, or the Integrated Future Front.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:53]** Right.

**[00:25:53 - 00:26:06]** And what they are is a bunch of fanatics that are associated with precogs and about making the future better in whatever crazy view they have of their own.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** Want to add anything to that, John?


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:21]** Yeah, it's a little more nuanced in that they basically like their founders saw a glimpse of the future and then have come back and said, well, this is what it will take to get there, which I really like as a premise.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:31]** I think that's just an interesting idea that they actually like saw the future, allegedly, but I think actually, you know, and then like came back and said, all right, well, this is what it looked like.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:34]** And then you can see how there are like

**[00:26:34 - 00:27:04]** different groups that would split off of that and some would be like well the text says this but it doesn't mean that right like what's the actual meaning of the text here in this line so that really means this and they have their own interpretation and some people have a literal interpretation who says like no this building is green and if it's pink then i'm gonna blow it up you know and that level of like ideology is such an interesting idea that if somebody said hey i've seen the future this is what you need to do and it leads to a utopian society like

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:07]** That's kind of convincing in a Starfinder world, right?

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** Where time travel might be possible?

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** Maybe.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:12]** If the future is set.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:16]** Is it at all related to the veil, which I was told not to Google?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** Yeah, don't do that.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** The veil is different.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:24]** The veil is part of more of a clairvoyant...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:42]** organization related to the barathu super group right kevin sorry john are you like trying to create connections in some way with this like uh cognition kind of thing going on that you have this thread that she's bringing in all of our shows now he takes a deep sip of his drink

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** Yeah.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** I'm not going to answer that, he says.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** Like I said on Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:46]** Telepathically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** I'm so annoyed.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:48]** Here it is.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** And whatever may be up there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:53]** The first question John doesn't answer in Blood Armor.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:53]** Sorry.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** In Blood Armor, otherwise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:56]** Keep a ticker.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** Just put a one in my corner on the video.

**[00:27:59 - 00:27:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:02]** Just put a single Rolo.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** And then, like, that'll be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** Yeah.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** It's measured in Rolos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:09]** Him doing his, like, pretentious little, like, pointing up at the sky kind of thing that he does.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** Whatever he does with your little token.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:12]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:38]** rid anyway uh yeah so those those are the uh the group that that ambushed the maro museum of natural history which by the way just got in a lot of new exhibits and then some careless members of the star team destroyed them which we would spend all their endowment money what would you rather have expensive insurance for all these interesting pieces


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** It wasn't a desk boom.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** It was a dinosaur.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:45]** Whenever things like this happen, there's always damage of a collateral nature.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** I mean, this is what happens.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:52]** We're there to protect people, not dinosaurs that have been long dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:55]** Yeah, the museum should have had metal detectors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:58]** That's all I'm saying.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** In Starfinder, metal detectors.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:02]** Yes, that sounds like a good thing.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** Yeah.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:06]** Anyway, so after that, what happens, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:12]** Well, just a couple of things to note from that is, yeah, the IFF have a vision of an alternate utopia.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:18]** And then some of the comments that we pulled from there, the future demands payment.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** The stars will pay for a life.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** For tomorrow, I see.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:27]** It's something that Kara noted while we were combating them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:27]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:30]** That was the prophecy laid out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:41]** So after that, we are sent to the office slash home of... Don't even get into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:50]** And then the biggest rant ever next to nuclear power rants happened with Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** We're not even there.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** We're not even there yet, and it showed up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:57]** That was the monster of all hills that Kevin wanted to die on.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:19]** came up in several episodes yeah yeah the and like as someone who works from home like i just it's different it's an office in your home not a home in your office as compared to a home next to your office cares kevin no one gives a shit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:48]** office home can I just say that I found this piece of music let's just change the subject I found a piece of music for your like getting ready in the copter to go and can I just say that I'm gonna play it right now because I'm so I feel so lucky that I found it because it felt so much like yeah like we're riding about to fucking go into this building it like it just feels like it's like yeah like I can see the skylines right now going

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:56]** As the copter is pulling in at sunset on the fucking last time that the sun's going to hit Morrow for a month.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** It's like, yeah, let's get ready to drop in.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:02]** Anyway, that was a fun find that I found.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:05]** So you're doing that and then you're going to the home slash personal residence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Yeah, about that dropping in part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:07]** Yeah.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** That was a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** That was a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:21]** John put so much effort into this huge backstory for me, and I almost died completely on the dismount from the helicopter.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** Yeah.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:25]** But before that, Cecil did call his family.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:26]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** That was a mistake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** That was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:56]** it's like a but she's not in the game like yeah well no it's it's more like cecil promised to be home and of course if you make a promise it's gonna break it's never gonna and you know the pep talk in the helicopter ride yeah that's right that was a good pep talk that that was when i really felt like the team was starting to come together and you all played it really well like there was a clear history you know that was that was great that was great

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** Kara texted with her mom.

**[00:31:59 - 00:31:59]** That's nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Yeah.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:06]** One thing about the phone call is Tonem, Cecil's son, kept talking about a signal.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** Is there anything to that, John?


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:09]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:31]** question it's a good question yeah there is definitely something more to that for sure for sure that's two for sure maybe i'll get to it later in the game later in this uh episode or maybe it'll just be later in through fall we'll see and what was the weird message from cara's mom cara's mom was just gonna ask she wanted to talk to cara

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:31]** Right.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** I think that was it.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:39]** And that's unusual for, for cars mom to be like, Hey, we need to talk to like reach out for help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:39]** Yeah.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:46]** Do you want to go into Kara's past it all, Will?

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:51]** I feel like we brushed it, but we never peeled it open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** We don't have to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** I feel like there's something there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:00]** Maybe it'll come out through other... Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:03]** So Will's not going to answer questions now.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:05]** That's a third roll-up.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** I'm just lazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:09]** I'm just lazy and I don't want to give it away for free.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** It's alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Alright, so we drop in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Well, four of us drop in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** Three of us drop in.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** The last of us barely makes it.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:30]** And then Bolt kind of joins us via this Archie, which is an aggregate recon something or other drone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:40]** Yeah, Archie is the name stands for, as I pull up my notes, aggregate reconnaissance communication hover interface.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** It's cute for us.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:42]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** Oh, wait.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** Was Archie 92 minutes until sundown?

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Yes, Archie was a traitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** At the very end of all things?

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:51]** Okay.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** I just wanted to be sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:55]** Yeah, I feel like Archie was just a construct.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:59]** Like, you know, is a knife inherently evil?

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** No, it depends on the hands that are at the helm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** Yeah.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** So who...

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:04]** Yeah.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:06]** Who was controlling Archie then?

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** It wasn't us in the end.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** Like, they took control of him.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:09]** I can't remember.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** It was never us.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Yeah, it was Bolt.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:14]** So we need to know if Bolt was evil or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:15]** Right.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** Yeah.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** And so at the time, Bolt kind of briefs us.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** We don't have...

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:44]** any maps of the inside of the building um because then we'd be like why the are an office and and a residence connected to each other yeah someone would someone would um yeah we would have we would have we would have not gone in and then we would all be alive um but there's also 92 minutes to sundown and at sundown leora is going to die is the is the the rules that we were given by iff


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** We knew it was a trap the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** Right.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:54]** Like, what if we'd stood in the museum and be like, all right, fucking let her die.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** Right.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** Fuck capitalism.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:59]** Just like, yeah, it's all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:04]** Well, we probably would have been in dereliction of duty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** They did ask you to go safer.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:17]** And Commander Bolt was like, from the beginning, was like, look, some of these patterns are consistent with the previous kidnappings that you all had been so stellar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** So, like, we want to get this done.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:21]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** Yeah, we were totally stellar.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** Super stellar.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** Super stellar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:32]** So once we're all firmly on the ground, we had a couple of scorpion things to take out.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:33]** Needle hawks.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** What?

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:35]** Needle hawks.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** Needle hawks.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:38]** They're fun.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:42]** They're crab scorpion eagles is what I have in the notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:45]** And then we all move forward.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:49]** Boom got poisoned, but we figured that out because apparently Cecil is also the medic of the team.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:57]** And then Migo finds the deck that has not been used and dust is settled.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:03]** And so then we go up to the glass and when you listen to the door, you hear voice of Leora Huxley.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:09]** But by the time we get into the room, you realize it's just a recording.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:27]** of leora huxley where she was practicing her speech that she gave the night of the attack which was just 40 minutes earlier i guess whatever um and so we breached that door we move in which like i have to commend leora i guess i guess


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:40]** She knew it was going to get interrupted, but took the time to write it carefully and rehearse it and practice it and make sure that the drone gave her full points and was prepared to deliver the whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:43]** I mean, she didn't get to where she was by being...

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:43]** Lazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:44]** Right.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** She didn't half-ass it.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** She didn't half-ass it.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** She knew that it was in vain.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:51]** She knew she wasn't going to be able to deliver the whole thing.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** But still, she was ready for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:56]** If you don't end this with a Huxley joke, I'm really going to be sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** I thought he was going to do that.

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:00]** I saw his face light up when he started talking about it.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** Yeah, I was loading it up.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:04]** I was waiting for it, but apparently he was calling it a Huxley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:06]** If he just ended up a Bruxley...

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:29]** that's good that's good that's good i think the bot would give you like a 60 out of 100 um cool so we move into the next round or the next room and in that room there's a big round table that is quickly destroyed um by a grenade from boom yep and there are two vesks

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** And we take out the vests.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** I think one is killed and one is knocked out.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** We also find some artifacts.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:46]** There was a Thastron – last Thastron trade paper, some info goggles, and a tech sublingual enhancement device.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:47]** Yeah.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** Which was – I believe this is the tongue device.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** It would actually make your tongue be able to speak different languages.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:52]** Yeah.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:56]** But it was discontinued because it would also make your tongue hackable.

**[00:37:59 - 00:37:59]** Wow.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:02]** Hack into your voice and make you say whatever you wanted to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** Yeah.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:10]** That was another GamuBio and VitariTech collab device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:13]** What was the significance of that bill of sale?

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:17]** Was it just neat fodder to put in her office?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:18]** Which one?

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** That device?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** The Thestron device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:43]** trade paper yeah that that that was a world building thing that was just like kind of a like you know they used to be known for that saran it's just kind of highlighting where they used to be and where they are now okay you know if you're keeping track at home listeners that's two questions and one um direct question that john has two questions he's not answered and one that he has


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** Another one, I thought.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** I thought I answered another one.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** It's okay.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** Put the tally up.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:55]** But we have three rollers because Will also didn't answer a question.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** It's true.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** Yeah, it's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** Kif?

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:01]** Sorry, I'm reading the notes because I wasn't prepared for this.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:07]** So, Colonel Bolt tells us that they are trying to get details from the architect, but the architect is refusing.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:10]** But looking back, I'm not even sure that even happened.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:13]** The janitor, though, said there was movement in the library.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:18]** And Kinkara says Leora is the ringleader.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:20]** You'll find them at the gate.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:26]** Which makes a lot more sense now after the fact.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** Yeah.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:37]** Another thing was Lieutenant Lua read through all the statements and none of them remember what happens five minutes before anybody got there.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:45]** So all the victims that we found or all the perpetrators that we found had their memory wiped for five minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:49]** Which we still haven't gotten to the bottom of.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:52]** We might never get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** Right.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** Is that a fold to the conspiracy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:55]** Yeah.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:59]** John, do you want to tell us that answer?

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** Do you want that answer now or do you want that answer later?

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** Like, later in the set.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:04]** Now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** You want it now?

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** Oh, you're really pushing the buttons today.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:16]** Well, I don't want to spoil it, but think about how it ended where...

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:20]** Cecil was having some of his memories.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:23]** It's all simulation, isn't it?

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:29]** We saw at the very end that Cecil was hanging out with the three of you in Morrow and with his family.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:38]** And then kind of the lights start to grow out and we see while he's on that bed that there's something scanning his head.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:47]** And also at the very beginning of, well, at the end, I think, of Leora's speech, she says, if you don't do this,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:47 - 00:41:15]** i'm gonna erase any existence of you in your family and she holds up a device and it's this little gray device and i'll tell you something and she she pushes the button and it goes flash yeah flash okay hang on hang on hang on hang on yeah yeah when you say that's a little gray device you don't mean is the color gray you fuck a actual gray device you

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** I'm so upset with you right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:27]** But before you... Wherever your brain is going, maybe this helps you put some things together.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:30]** How far away is Kefauk Depot from Mara?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** Let's look at a map.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:36]** It's a 40-minute bus ride.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** Google Maps.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:39]** Kefauk Depot.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:39]** Tomorrow.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:42]** There's a map.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** Hold on.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** I want to see.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:46]** Google Maps of Accutane.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:48]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:51]** In Junkers Delight, you landed in Morrow.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:55]** You guys landed in Morrow and took a bus to Kefauk Depot.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** Because Morrow is the only landing pad.

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** There's no landing pads in Kefauk Depot.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** And at that time, nothing could fly in Kefauk Depot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:04]** Nothing could fly in Kefauk Depot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:07]** Nothing can fly in Kefauk Depot anymore.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** Anyways, this is about Junkers Delight.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:11]** This is about Nano Adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:14]** Or is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:19]** Right, but I mean, that is part of the greater, we'll say, of the intergalactic adventure.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** Yeah, these are important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** Like, I want to know these connections.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** Indeed.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Indeed.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Wait, Mara?

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** Mara's the name of the planet or the city?

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** I can't believe I can't.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** The city.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** It's a city.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** What city on the planet?

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:32]** Akiton.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** Oh, well, it's a f***ing planet.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:35]** Do you know that?

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Alright, so yeah, yeah.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** I got you.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:39]** Alright, cool, cool.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:41]** Absalom Station isn't too far away.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** Absalom Station is a separate planet, Tyler.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:46]** It is, but I just mean it's not so far away.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:48]** I'm just commenting on the map that I saw.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** It's closer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:51 - 00:43:03]** For context, Akiton is the Mars of the Pact Worlds, and Absalom Station is Earth, or replaced Earth, because Galarian was Earth.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:05]** Castorvel looks like Earth, too.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:12]** Castor Val is like a... I don't know what planet it would be.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:15]** Yeah, it's a jungle planet, is what Castor Val is.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** Anyways, we digress.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:22]** So, back to where we were.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:27]** We get our information from the team, and that's absolutely not helpful at all.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** And then we move through the south door.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:32]** But looking back, it's like, why was...

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:36]** why would Lieutenant Lua give us any information?

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:38]** She was just like leading.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** They were all leading us into this.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:44]** It was, here's just enough information to keep you from asking more questions.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** Kind of like John does when he's GMing.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** What are you talking about?


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** I don't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:49 - 00:44:02]** And so we go through the next door, and there's actually a reception desk, and there's a Yosuke behind it, and we're not quite sure if this Yosuke is an IFF member until they shout, the stars will lose light, and Migo knocks them the fuck out.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:11]** And then there's another door with a lock, and Migo tries to open it, and then a second Yosuke opens that and takes a nice big hit on him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:14]** I get zapped by the lock, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Yeah, that was fun.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:18]** Can I just say traps in Starfinder are fun, but there aren't too many.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:22]** You have to come up with some on your own.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:31]** So if you're looking out there to create, they give you a good little template of things to work on, but then you have to come up with some on your own.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:35]** So anyway, yeah, you did get zapped from that, which I was glad that you triggered it.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:36]** Because then later...

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Anyway.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** So what happens next, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:49]** During that combat, I'm not sure what your comment was, but during that combat, one of the Ahsokis actually recognizes Kara and is almost kind of infatuated.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** Like, oh my god, that's Kara.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** Wow, she's the stars team.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** We got the stars team to come?

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** That's great.

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:19]** yeah an autograph yeah and she's immediately uh uncomfortable and knocks knocks him out yeah um and so there's a security room there and we get in there and boom does a computer check and uh plugs into the cameras we put a wire tap on it so we can see those cameras which didn't really help us in the end um

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:24]** But we also found that there was a memo from Liora Huxley to a security individual.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** And it says, thanks for the system upgrades.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:30]** But then boom, shuts down all the traps using that memo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Right.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** So that was my comment.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:37]** Was that like, I got one trap off as a GM, but then the rest, you all shut down, which was awesome.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:43]** I think where the cameras helped you were allowing you to say, oh, okay.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** We know who's left.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** And it was the bar.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** Right.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:51]** And you and the only other one of the bathroom where there wasn't a camera, of course.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** But that's gross.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** Right.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** Right.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:59]** But it did allow you to say, OK, now we know the stakes in this area before we move on.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:03]** And and then you, you know, you use it appropriately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:13]** Yeah, so we use the cameras, and we actually see that there's a Yosuke at the bar, an IFF Yosuke member at the bar with a gun on the bar, talking to the bartender.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:16]** And at that point, we thought the bartender was possibly being held hostage.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:21]** Find out later that she was just keeping the guy company, and he was kind of depressed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:22]** That's bartenders, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:25]** I didn't kill him.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** Which one of us killed him?

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** We didn't kill him, did we?

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** The bartender?

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** I think we knocked him out.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:29]** The Yosuke.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:31]** The Yusuke.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** Not the bartender.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:32]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** I don't know.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** I can't remember.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** I don't think we killed the Yusuke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:36]** Oh, you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:37]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:37]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** That was just my headcanon.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** No, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** You definitely... We knock out the Yusuke.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:42]** We knock out the Yusuke.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** And Rose was the Yusuke.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** Rose.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:49]** But before that, we found... We knew that there was somebody in the bathroom.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** Something in the bathroom making noise.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:56]** And so we entered the bathroom and breached the door and we obliterated the dude.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** Yeah.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:57]** Kicked the door open.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Yeah.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** Uh...

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:06]** And I believe it was Migo ended it with smashing his head into the toilet and lighting him on fire.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:14]** There was a debate about whether or not a fire would go off, but with the water spraying up, like, I don't know.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** Moving on!

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:28]** Then we move to the bar, we knock out the Yosuke, and we find out that Yosuke was just upset because he wasn't a part of the main team to capture Leora, which means that he didn't know anything because Leora wasn't captured.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:35]** His name was Clive, by the way.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:35]** Clive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:36 - 00:48:00]** what a guy did did he and rose date like were they a thing no i think they just they just had a connection at that time yeah they were like in in the time that he was stuck at the bar whining about his career she kind of had a thing i i want she okay she didn't have a thing for him that was we're shipping them john i know that's fine kelly how that works what did you say stan


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:03]** We're shipping Rose and Clive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:07]** Was I shipping them?

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:14]** For the record, I successfully shipped that one pairing in UT, right?

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** You know what I mean, Kevin, right?

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** Michael?

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:18]** Was it?

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** No, not you and Michael.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:20]** Not Rolu and Michael.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:24]** It was Rolu and the Keshti.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** No, I was... No, no, no.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:29]** I was talking about the Yusuke and the Keshti or whatever that Kevin had.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:35]** Did I... I think I properly shipped Rolu and the Keshti, too.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** I'm an expert shipper, okay?

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** So if I say...

**[00:48:38 - 00:49:04]** i mean i'm gonna say what is your stance what is your stance on rose and clive i think the bartender i wouldn't say that they were in love or whatever well i wouldn't say it's not like you know what happened in ut with both of those couples i'd say it's more like rose is just wary of him because she knows he's a boy but at the same time like they kind of dig each other they have a little bit of history yeah you know what that's fine

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:09]** Yeah, but they had a tryst or two or three or whatever, but it's not deep.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** She knows.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Or they will, yeah.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** If they're alive, who knows anymore?

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** We don't know what happened to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:24]** Well, I mean, there is a bit of a time... There's a bit of a time point that you can start to draw from, based on my previous comment.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:36]** The thing with them is that I wanted a hostage situation, but I didn't want it to be typical, nor did I want it to be, like, just, like, people bound in the corner, and, like, it's, like...

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:50]** awkward it it just felt weird like to have that so i wanted something that felt maybe a little more there's more stock homey than it was which was unintended but yes yes yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** Oh, right.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:51]** So, moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** I mean, maybe she visits Clive in jail.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:54]** Like, hey, babe.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** Anyway, moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:05]** So, after that, Boom and Kara kind of tag team using their seismic detector.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:07]** And what is the thing Kara used all the time?

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:10]** Sensing something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** Oh, goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** Oh, that was dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** That was dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** But, yeah.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:19]** That was the electro location graph augmentation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:19]** Womp womp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:25]** Yet another instance of you all using the kit and stuff to good, putting it to good use.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:25]** Yeah.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:32]** So using those tools, we found all the traps, except for the one trap that we stood on top of while using the seismograph.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:35]** Luckily, that thing was turned off because otherwise we'd all be dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:45]** I want to say, too, that had this gotten, I had so many weird things that I was expecting to maybe try and use, but I didn't use any of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:45]** Like what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** I had a grenade scrambler.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:49]** which was cool.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:59]** It would, it gives like a percent, uh, chance of miss and any grenade that targets an intersection area, uh, lands one D six away.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:06]** So like somebody was coming after us, uh, the scrambler turned on us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:08]** We'd have, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:11]** Um, I don't know.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:16]** I guess I use the micro trip, um, tap already.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:18]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:42]** i i tried to do my best to put in things that would like that wouldn't be antithetical to your character's builds or what was in their their kit obviously it's not possible to do that for every single device that you have and i but i tried to do it as much as i could so that way it's like it actually went into use you know but the grenade gambler i think is really dope maybe it's something you want to get for threefold


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:47]** I think that's one of the things I actually really enjoyed about this mini-adventure was the puzzles.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** It felt very escape room-y.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:54]** We were trying to find the next... And we'll get into that in just a second, but... So...

**[00:51:55 - 00:52:01]** After Boom uses his seismic detector, we track the emergency beacon further into the residence.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:08]** And that's when we actually have to get into the residence wing, which was just another office because we never found a bed.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:13]** So there was never a full home.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** You've been dying on this hill for how many weeks now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:21]** Yeah, I think what happened... John told me he was like, I'm just going to remove it because it's going to result in more ranting.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** So he got rid of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:46]** yeah yeah i was like do you do you want to put in this floating orb thing yeah just put in more office let's just like cut it off here like we don't want to do yeah yeah yeah do you want the real gm design answer to that or do you want that background or not because we can keep going if you want if you want to what the the residence bed office thing yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:46]** Yeah, let's hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:55]** Truthfully, it was that I was going back and forth between a couple different ways to get into this office.

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:04]** And I had a map that included an outdoor courtyard that I instead said you could see through the window.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:06]** And I was going to have you go there.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:11]** And then I started to realize, I think the more maps I add, the more episodes and time it's going to be.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:17]** And so I and that map had a door that I was going to say, this is the door to the office.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** And then there was there were two other doors.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:25]** And I was going to say I was going to make one of them like a very private residence, kind of like you're in the kitchen.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:27]** And then there's a there's a guest bedroom, right?

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:29]** Like if you wanted to.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:31]** And then I just realized that that would work.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:58]** add too much time and i would love to do that if we were just making up for as much as possible but since we were trying to get to a certain place and keep things tight i just took away that that whole map you're gonna keep so it's not it's not a residence it it's just it is a residence it no it it it's just a private office anyway it's flex commercial space it's mixed use okay mixed use


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:05]** All right, so we make it into the residential wing, and when we get in there, there's a mechanical floating orb statue.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:13]** It is a really unique statue that is a bunch of metallic plates orbiting around a core.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:19]** And one of them tends to stand out, but we'll get back to that in a second.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** So we started looking around the room.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** Does anybody remember anything from this room in particular?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** I remember the fireplace being really suspect.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:29]** I remember there being a lot of bookshelves.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:30]** But that was it.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** Anybody else?

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:35]** It was clear we had to look around there to find the answer.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:38]** Sort of like you said, it was very escape room-esque.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:43]** You're talking about where the library-ish kind of thing, like through the door?

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:46]** Not the library, in the office with the orb.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:52]** No, I just remember that she had very tasteful design choices, that's all I remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:52 - 00:55:00]** Well, and boom, it got on the computer, and on the computer you found some emails that draws from that one university-ish kind of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:03]** It's the Singularity Conservatory.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:04]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Which is just a cool spot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** That's Paizo Cannon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:12]** Yeah, it reminded me of, like, in... Not Elden.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** Yeah, in Elden Ring.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:15]** Like, that, like, mage university.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:18]** The way that it was described sort of reminded me of that.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** I thought it was cool.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:24]** And that's where I was like, ah, this might have a connection to Rolly, possibly.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** I could see, like...

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:27]** John, are we leaving that in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:32]** Is that a canon Paizo established organization?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:34]** It's dope.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:36]** It's in Galactic Magic.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:47]** Again, they have those things called the crossings where every few years they cross the event horizon and while one is headed towards it, they build another one.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:54]** And then some professors or students or whatever decide to stay on.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:57]** As it crosses and the rest of them leave.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:57]** Yeah.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** It's neat.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** Cool work, Paizo people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** They Migo it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** They Migo it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:09]** They step towards the black hole in order to prevent the AOL on the other university.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:09]** The AONO.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:10]** We'll get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:14]** We'll get there.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:23]** That's when you start to see that Leora is involved with some of this, because she's adjunct teaching and things like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:29]** And all the books were all related to precog stuff, and we're like, that is just sus.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:31]** That was the point where I was like, Leora's...

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Leora's a fucking turncoat.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** That's where I was convinced that Leora was wrong.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:41]** That also was... Boone was all suspicious about that.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:41]** Yeah.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** Anyway, just chiming in the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** I agree.

**[00:56:45 - 00:57:00]** That overall was probably the hardest part for me because I, as the player, from the scene at the museum, hearing the discourse and everyone using that same phrasing...

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:22]** of a better morrow tomorrow was just like okay this is fishy as fuck everyone is in on this is what it smells like but also i don't think migo would think that and let's push this story forward and see what happens interesting yeah yeah i i'll i'll be honest that i


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:25]** we'll get to when I thought Lua turned.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:29]** Um, but I wasn't convinced at this point.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:31]** I thought it was just Leora that was involved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:32]** Yeah.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** I didn't see Lua coming.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** It was for me.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:38]** It was, I didn't see Lua coming at all until she showed up.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:48]** It was, uh, it was Leora and, um, the commander bolt bolt that both use that same terminology.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:48]** And I was like,

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:50]** Y'all are sus.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:52]** Y'all are both f***ing sus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:52]** Yeah.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** Everybody's sus in this, including John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:55]** Everyone.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** John's always sus.

**[00:57:57 - 00:58:00]** That's on brand for the entire three-fold conspiracy.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:07]** I thought that Net-A-Venture might be different, and then we just walked right into immediate paranoia of everyone and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** I know.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:09]** You let your guard down.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:11]** You're like, oh, this is pre-three-fold.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:16]** This is no paranoia required, and we were all wrong on that one.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:17]** Yeah.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:23]** There was a moment where it turned on when we got inside and there's hallways to go through.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** Now we're like, oh yeah, it's back.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** It's back for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** It's just like book two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:28]** Yeah.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** So I wanted a bit of that.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** I wanted that like...

**[00:58:32 - 00:59:00]** easy kind of or not easy but like i wanted that like straightforward you are like that like that was a big element of this whole thing was that you're a stars team you should you should be able to come in and crush and knock down doors and take people out and knock them unconscious and kill them and you did and i think it was fun and cool like like that like that was fun i think for me to like play against you all being the people who are like oh they're here like get your guys get them out you know like like that's like that's like a fun thing to to do and you all killed it yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:06]** John and I worked on this a little bit here and there.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:10]** I gave John my backstory as here is Cecil.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** He has a family.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:15]** And then something happens.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Now he's Rick.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** That's pretty much all I gave John.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:22]** A little more fleshed out, but that was the most of it.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:25]** And John is filling the gaps for me.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:32]** I, as a player, do not know how Cecil and Rick are connected yet.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** Is that, is everybody following me?

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** You guys look confused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:37]** Yeah, no, I, uh, I don't.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:38]** Yeah.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:40]** I mean, I hear the words that you're saying.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** I don't know that I believe them.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:49]** Like, I feel like there's, there's more to be heard about that bridge between Cecil and Rick.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:54]** And there were, I think there are revelations at the end of the story, but okay.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:57]** I'll, I'll, I'll take you at what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** I have a cabin question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:29]** kevin when did you really start to be like ah yeah this might be related to backstory like what because i know you said obviously at the end for sure but like you mentioned that earlier on you're like that's probably for those watching for those watching on youtube john has a tell and it and it's when he leans way back and covers his mouth with his hand oh i that was not it it is typically a tell i did it as just a thing like i was just wiping something from my mustache that's it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** Sure you were.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:35]** John and I worked on this prior to the NanoVenture.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:40]** Like, I knew going into this that NanoVenture... I helped...

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:47]** the rule of the nanite for level four and the nanites being required.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:53]** And one of the things I talked to John about was the idea that all of you guys had nanites, but it was Cecil's first injection.

**[01:00:54 - 01:01:00]** And that's... I mean, like I said, Rick has a level of nanosite.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:03]** I took that in our last level up.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:08]** So that was when I was already planning to put the story into motion.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** Um...

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:19]** so like I, I worked with John to set up a lot of this, but like the story filling in the gaps that that was something John was like, I could tell you.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:22]** And I was like, no, I want to learn this like, like with the listeners.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:30]** So I still like where we left at the very end of Dano adventure is as far as I know,

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:34]** between Cecil and Rick.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:34]** And there's more.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:37]** I'll be honest.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:43]** I've given John not just one idea, but I've just been throwing ideas at John.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:49]** And out of all the different ideas that I've thrown at John, I don't know which one he's going to stick.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:51]** It could be any of them.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:58]** Even if I thought I had it in mind, even if I have a plan for Rick, it could be completely off the rails.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:01]** Sorry.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:04]** I think that's just how I am as a player.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:16]** I did the same thing with our D&D game where I was like, this is my character and here is a big void that I want the GM to fill in for me.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:22]** And I think it also gives you as a GM the opportunity to kind of connect that to other things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** I hope so.


## Speaker_0

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:33]** It just goes back to when we first made the threefold characters and how I always ask you guys, how much of your backstory do you want ownership over?

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:37]** And how much are you just like, here's an idea and here are the spaces to fill in?

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** Which for all of you, it's different.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:42]** Some have more ideas, some have less.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:44]** Some want more, some want less, which is great.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:45]** It's per person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:51]** But I will say, though, for Nano Adventure, when Judd and I first talked about it, I suggested doing a single episode...

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:55]** Hey, flash over the eyes and we're in a shootout.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:58]** And then the shootout turns into something revealing.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:05]** And John was like, no, I'm going to make it into seven episodes or 10 episodes.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:05]** Or 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:07]** Cool.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:12]** But I do like that you did scale the characters down.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:15]** The villains are scaled down.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:24]** A lot of them were three hits and they were out, which made it feel very SWAT-like, very quick-paced.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:31]** And it also felt very time... I'm a huge fan of arcade first-person shooters.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:44]** like uh like carnival and felt like an rts a little bit cool sometimes yeah good time crisis yeah felt time crisis yeah yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:44 - 01:04:05]** as as as close as a dice rolling the you know over the internet game can be yeah that's that was my intent was to have it feel like that well it's a little closer to time crisis than i thought now that we talk about precogs and and everything else but yeah if you haven't played time crisis go play it's a great arcade game yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:06]** But yeah.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** Any other questions?

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** About?

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:09]** Did we answer?

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:09]** Yeah.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** Did that answer your question?

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:12]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:13]** Or Vinny was also.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:13]** Yeah.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:15]** I don't remember the initial question.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:18]** I feel like we've meandered down that path far enough that.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:18]** Yeah.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** Okay.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:19]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:20]** So back to the office.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:24]** The residential wing.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:26]** So we're in that office.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:27]** There's a big floating orb thing they were talking about.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:32]** And there's a picture on the wall, which I love the idea of this.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:33]** And I think John could have used it further.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:35]** I talked to him about it after the episode.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:38]** The picture on the wall is a precog mirror.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:41]** It shows five seconds into the future.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:42]** Is that right?

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:43]** 20 seconds.

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:45]** 20 seconds, even better, 20 seconds into the future.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:51]** Um, and I was telling John, like after the episode, I was like, dude, you totally could have used that to railroad that scene.

**[01:04:52 - 01:05:03]** Like imagine being in an escape room and the escape room yourself telling you like you, you pick this clue up or you see that or you, yeah.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:11]** Um, that didn't happen, but, um, it was, it really was a fun idea of having this mirror kind of showing you where you will be.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:13]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:38]** and part of that mirror we used secret slime and you could see the outline of the fireplace great use of secret slime had a gap yep i think that was the first time i think we've seen it used and it's cool i like it i'm definitely gonna use i thought migo used it uh on one of the doors yes he still used it on on the exterior that's right i want to use it now it's so cool that's fun yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:46]** Yeah, so then you find, and shout out to Frag Maps for coming up with a cool map that had the swinging door.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:47]** That was a cool map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:55]** But the way that door opened was one of the metallic pieces floating around the statue.

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:58]** was linked to the solar panel.

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:05]** And we actually used the mirror to see that the one piece circling was different from the others.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:10]** And we aligned that to the solar array.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:12]** And that's what actually opened the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:16]** Yeah, it was a hard one to explain in the moment.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:18]** And then you guys were like trying to go through the ideas.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:19]** So that was also on me if it seemed clunky.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:23]** But like, yeah, the idea was that it would change every 20 seconds.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:31]** And so like, that's why you would see like one light up and then one kind of go away and then another one would take its place.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:51]** yeah which also you needed the light of the sun in order to get in which was also part of the like idea 92 minutes until sundown right exactly that for that if that hadn't happened then while i'm sure in starfinder you could recreate that you know like signature or something maybe

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:57]** Yeah, like, you could probably do it, but the idea was that it would lock without any other means of doing it.

**[01:06:57 - 01:07:00]** But otherwise, during the day, you could get in there, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:08]** The stars must align for the divine to make itself known on this plane of existence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:09]** I mean, you said it better than I ever could.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:11]** That was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:13]** So we get that secret door to open up.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:15]** We go down the staircase.

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:17]** There's just a boring library.

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:18]** Nothing happens.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:21]** Just a Shabbat kind of hiding in the corner.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:22]** We kill him.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:26]** Turns out he's just one of the best mercenaries in the known.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:27]** Yeah.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:28]** Just a guy trying to do a job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:29]** That was a little bit underwhelming.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:31]** Yeah.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:51]** well he was a cool character it's just as you say it's crazy to see like how a legend it's like killing cad bane like it's a couple moves cool character yeah yeah yeah yeah i i go back and forth i could have made him harder i also like that no that's okay you see


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:53]** Because it set the level that you all were at.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:56]** And then it also set the contrast for the final fight.

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:56]** Right.

**[01:07:56 - 01:08:01]** It's like it like it lulls you into a sense of like, cool, like we can do this.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:01]** Yeah.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:04]** You know, which was on purpose.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:05]** Your intent.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:05]** We know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:07]** Thank you, Joe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:10]** Maybe we were so awesome.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:12]** I'm not going to answer any more questions.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:14]** We were so awesome that we took him out.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:16]** Even though he was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:20]** I have his name as Malarash.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:24]** Is Malarash a canon Paizo character?

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:24]** No.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:28]** Just curious.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:32]** I'm very curious about what you pulled from actual Paizo versus what's all homebrewed.

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:34]** Because I've never done homebrewed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:34 - 01:09:02]** um well you that i mean wow rude kevin undersells himself will is ready kevin you created like your own characters and your own plot points entirely in ut i thought it was really good i had no idea they did more creative things than were there on the page at times i think i only made i only created like three or four characters yeah but they were huge pretty rich

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:04]** They were huge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:10]** So, Mala Rosh is the surviving member of their tribe, and they became a mercenary.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:13]** And their data pad said, hold them off as long as possible.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:22]** Some of the things we picked up from that office room, that's where we found the book about... I always forget his name.

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:23]** Something black.

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:24]** Black something.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:25]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:28]** Which I'm afraid to Google, because I feel like that is a Paizo character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:31]** Mycroft Black...

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:32]** Mycroft Black.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:33]** Not a Paizo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:37]** Not a Paizo character.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:38]** He was a cool shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:46]** That was a fun thing for me because I was also listening to the audiobook of Altered Carbon.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:49]** Mycroft is...

**[01:09:49 - 01:10:03]** banks i forget his last name was like a major player like killed himself shattered his stack oh that's right yeah yeah yeah yeah huge character in that series


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:10]** I'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan, and it reminds me of Mycroft Holmes.

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:19]** There's a lot of Mycrofts that have their big behind-the-scenes, secretly powerful characters, and it's kind of cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:20]** Mycroft Holmes?

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:21]** Is that Sherlock Holmes' evil twin?

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:22]** It's his brother.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:27]** Sherlock painted as evil, but he's not really evil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:32]** If you haven't seen it, the BBC's Sherlock did it really well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:32 - 01:10:35]** I really want to see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:37]** Each episode is like two hours.

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:41]** And that's not hyperbole.

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:43]** But they're so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:45]** My audio cut out for a second.

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:46]** What were we talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:48]** Each episode of the BBC Sherlock series.

**[01:10:49 - 01:10:50]** Oh, is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:50]** What's his name?

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:52]** Benedict Cumberbatch.

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:53]** Yeah, Benedict Cumberbatch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:54]** And Martin Freeman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:54]** Good series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:55 - 01:10:55]** Yeah, that's right.

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:56]** So good.

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:57]** I've seen some of that.

**[01:10:57 - 01:10:57]** So good.

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:00]** Yeah, highly recommended.

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:02]** Anyway, Mycroft.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:10]** Mycroft, turns out that he is a former CEO of Ringworks and a great inventor.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:14]** He put nanotech into the ships and he's listed on one of the bags.

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:16]** There's a fold out calendar.

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:18]** Oh yeah, there was this calendar.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:31]** And as you fold it out, it showed events that lined up with every one of the kidnappings, including today's date, the date of the events with Leora.


## Speaker_0

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:37]** Uh, and so the lines all kind of coordinated with the, those, those points.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:43]** And that's when we were like, oh crap, this is a, it's like a precog prediction map is what it was.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:46]** Um, and, uh, a couple other things in there.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:49]** We learned that it, the, the, the,

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:52]** the mountain that we're in used to be a faster on mine.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:54]** Yeah.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:55]** Uh, geothermal thing.

**[01:11:55 - 01:12:00]** Uh, and then it was used by the stewards for a while as one of their jump points.

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:11]** The draw stewards have, yeah, their draws, uh, which is basically a, a, a, a wormhole that lets the stewards very quickly get from one part of space to another.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:15]** Um, but now it is owned by ring works again.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:19]** And so, um, let's see.

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:19]** Shh,

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:41]** trying to think ringworks now makes luxury ships out of this building is that i've written down for some reason i don't know i mean yeah i mean they they do make some luxury ships sure and they're alive but it says ringworks is not known for this but we found records of the luxury ships oh yeah that's right yeah yeah they're not yeah um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:43]** Just for backstory flavor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:46]** And while we were there, Boom decided to take a phone call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:47]** Yeah.

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:48]** I completely forgot about that.

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:49]** What was that about?

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:53]** I can't remember.

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:54]** Who did I talk to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:59]** It was something to do with the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:20]** oh the beans oh yeah yeah yeah yeah i won like how many beans again was it like a lifetime supply of like beans yeah and a tour of the factory and a tour of the factory which boom didn't care about at all so then like he basically gave them to you might own the factory at the end though come on


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:21]** That's true.

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:23]** That's true.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:24]** It could be your ticket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:26]** Just don't eat the golf stopper.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:26]** That's true.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:28]** That could... Come with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:31]** Boom is pure of heart enough to win.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:35]** Imagine when Willy Wonka falls out.

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:37]** I mean, it has to have fallen out, right?

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:39]** It's in public domain, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:43]** Leora, imagine...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:44 - 01:13:47]** Blue vodka on Akaton with Boom.

**[01:13:47 - 01:13:48]** Pretty much.

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:50]** Boom would do a good job.

**[01:13:50 - 01:14:01]** But he gifted the lifetime supply, at least, maybe not the factory, but the lifetime supply to Cecil and his family.

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:02]** Which will come in handy later.

**[01:14:03 - 01:14:05]** I have to thank you so much.

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:07]** In a way you did not foresee.

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:08]** To set you up?

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:09]** Yeah, okay, cool.

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:10]** You're welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:14]** Collateral damage, man.

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:16]** It's all about that when you're a grenadier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:19]** When you're a grenadier.

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:20]** Is that how you pronounce it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:22]** Cool.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:25]** So while we're there, we realize there is a big vault door.

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:26]** It's the only way forward.

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:30]** Kara and Cecil cut it open, and we go down a staircase.

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:35]** As we open that next door, it leads to an industrial setting.

**[01:14:36 - 01:14:41]** There's a large orange glow of a geothermal plant, and there's this weird...

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:55]** circular gate leading to nothing uh and leora fucking first at first this this yeah she spends four and a half of our minute well four and a half minutes of our lives long time

**[01:14:56 - 01:15:08]** Ranting about Mycroft and how she wants to bring Mycroft back using the memories in the nanites that were all injected into our bodies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:09]** Yeah.

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:10]** To harvest us.

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:13]** You got Mycroft Black's nanobots.

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:16]** Nanites.

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:17]** That's what it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:17 - 01:15:21]** And so if they can harvest them from us, then they can put Mycroft back together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:23]** Yeah, that's the idea.

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:26]** With all the king's horses and all the king's men.

**[01:15:26 - 01:15:27]** Yep, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:29]** Yeah.

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:32]** And while we're having that conversation, uh,

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:36]** I forget who had the monitor, but Kara.

**[01:15:37 - 01:15:46]** Kara sees on the wiretap Lieutenant Lua and 10 Morrow shock troopers marching through the halls.

**[01:15:46 - 01:15:50]** And that is the moment that I was like, f***.

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:52]** we're not getting out of here alive.

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:59]** That was when I, I knew that, that Lua was turning on us and it wasn't, there wasn't anything concrete.

**[01:15:59 - 01:16:00]** It was just a gut feeling.

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:08]** Like John is using this as a, as a chance to make sure whatever we're supposed to have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:09]** I thought there was going to be a TPK.

**[01:16:10 - 01:16:11]** I thought so too.

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:15]** At the very end, like with how crazy it got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:16:15 - 01:16:17]** I'm, I'm apparently super naive.

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:19]** I thought that was backup.


## Speaker_0

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:16:20 - 01:16:43]** will i think you also were like oh sweet they're here to back us up unless yeah unless you were playing right right right yeah i was like dope leora you know strapped us up and she's pulling up with some dudes it's like all right let's we'll just we just need to hold them off until they get here and then leo pulled up was like get through the fucking gate it's like all right yeah okay i guess i was wrong about her


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:46]** Yeah, I think we can run through this pretty quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:48]** I guess I'll just go die now for everyone.

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:49]** Yeah.

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:50]** There's nothing left to live for anymore.

**[01:16:50 - 01:16:51]** Yeah, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:53 - 01:16:55]** I think we can run through this pretty quickly.

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:57]** We have this ridiculous combat with Leora.

**[01:16:57 - 01:17:04]** She does all sorts of shitty magic on us and then disappears and then calls in a giant time warp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:17:04 - 01:17:05]** Magic that was above board.

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:07]** Because this is an important point.

**[01:17:07 - 01:17:11]** Disappears after taking an A-O-O.

**[01:17:11 - 01:17:13]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:13 - 01:17:17]** I did verify this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:20]** Finder confirmed whatever the hell John did.

**[01:17:21 - 01:17:23]** Finder confirmed it for him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:23 - 01:17:29]** It's good to thank you having outside counsel for your tomfoolery and f*** you, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:30 - 01:17:32]** I just want to say, I really do appreciate the rules.

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:34]** I do appreciate it, though.

**[01:17:34 - 01:17:41]** Y'all, the moment that we ping you, there's like five of you just being like, yeah, this is what you do, this is what you do, and it's really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:42]** No, you're all f***ing wrong, and this is how.

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:44]** Yeah, that's it.

**[01:17:44 - 01:17:45]** Every time.

**[01:17:46 - 01:17:47]** It's a fun job.

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:49]** Come join our Paralegals on the Discord.

**[01:17:49 - 01:17:49]** Discord.

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:52]** Shout out to the paralegals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:52 - 01:17:53]** They are the best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:54]** They are the best firm there is.

**[01:17:55 - 01:18:02]** If you want like a bit of a preview before episodes release, like in the rules and mistakes channel, you'll sometimes get little hints.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:03 - 01:18:03]** That's true.

**[01:18:03 - 01:18:04]** That's true.

**[01:18:04 - 01:18:04]** Yeah.

**[01:18:04 - 01:18:05]** Yeah.

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:07]** That's an easy way to get some, some questions.

**[01:18:07 - 01:18:07]** Yeah.

**[01:18:08 - 01:18:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:18:09 - 01:18:09]** Yep.

**[01:18:09 - 01:18:19]** So that's literally what happened is Leora cast something and then cast invisibility and teleport or something along those lines.

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:23]** She disappeared and teleported away after casting something on Cecil.

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:28]** And at the same time, a hound of Telemundos...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:34]** Wait, hold on.

**[01:18:34 - 01:18:40]** I know that's like a new statement, but what the fuck does it actually mean?

**[01:18:40 - 01:18:42]** Hold on, let me find out what it is.

**[01:18:46 - 01:18:47]** What does it mean, though?

**[01:18:47 - 01:18:49]** Wait, why is it called Telemundo?

**[01:18:49 - 01:18:50]** Why would you say that?

**[01:18:51 - 01:19:06]** Because they're actually called hounds of... Wait, so like the dogs are just looking at each other with like little drama.

**[01:19:07 - 01:19:09]** It's actually just a little white dog.

**[01:19:11 - 01:19:14]** He's like, it's not an eagle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:14 - 01:19:16]** No.

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:22]** Not to be racist or anything, but it's going to be a chihuahua, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:22 - 01:19:22]** Not necessarily.

**[01:19:24 - 01:19:27]** Not necessarily.

**[01:19:27 - 01:19:31]** As you later found out, it's a hound of Tindalos, yeah, which are cool creatures.

**[01:19:31 - 01:19:32]** Tindalos.

**[01:19:32 - 01:19:33]** Tindalos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:33 - 01:19:34]** I said Tindalos.

**[01:19:34 - 01:19:35]** Yeah.

**[01:19:35 - 01:19:36]** You were close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:36 - 01:19:37]** Very close.

**[01:19:37 - 01:19:38]** I know.

**[01:19:38 - 01:19:39]** Like, they're...

**[01:19:40 - 01:19:49]** If you want to know more about Leora, I can say something that will give you a little bit of a hint of her scale.

**[01:19:49 - 01:19:50]** I want to hear it.

**[01:19:51 - 01:19:54]** If you don't want to hear it, take off your headphones or skip ahead 30 seconds.

**[01:19:55 - 01:19:59]** A clue is that she is able to cast...

**[01:20:00 - 01:20:00]** Greater invisibility.

**[01:20:00 - 01:20:04]** Gonna look it up and see what class that came from.

**[01:20:04 - 01:20:11]** And I think from there, you can start to build out a rough sketch of Leora's power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:13]** Wave at me when you're done, because I'm not listening.

**[01:20:13 - 01:20:13]** I'm done.

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:14]** Precog.

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:15]** It's a precog thing.

**[01:20:15 - 01:20:16]** Or a technomancer.

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:19]** Yeah, but I guess it's very associated with precog.

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:21]** Is that the idea?

**[01:20:21 - 01:20:22]** Alright, alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:23]** Put my ears back in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:24]** Stop talking.

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:28]** I mean, they're all...

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:30]** She's basically like a miniature god or something.

**[01:20:30 - 01:20:31]** That's cool.

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:33]** The spell is level four.

**[01:20:33 - 01:20:34]** Yeah, it is.

**[01:20:35 - 01:20:36]** Technomancer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:38]** Okay, so moving on, guys.

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:41]** There's spells and stuff and Leora is mean.

**[01:20:41 - 01:20:45]** And the ghost hound is not a hellhound.

**[01:20:46 - 01:20:52]** It says to Cecil in his head, your misstep will lead to your death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:20:52 - 01:21:12]** um the creature attacks cecil we actually we held off this combat pretty well i don't think john expected us to take out that totally great and we did okay um question because i felt like this was was it the hound of tindalos or was it another creature that was like leora didn't necessarily summon it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:21:12 - 01:21:30]** this is what shows up when people fuck with the timeline yeah that's that's what it was right and this is something we don't have a clear clear connection with and and i don't know if john wants to answer it is was the hound coming after us or leora i'm not i'm gonna add a rolu thing to that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:30 - 01:21:32]** I think they're... Oh, it's Rolo.

**[01:21:33 - 01:21:35]** Rolo's the reason that the hound came, don't you say?

**[01:21:35 - 01:21:36]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:21:36 - 01:21:37]** That's sneaky, sneaky Rolo.

**[01:21:37 - 01:21:45]** I will say that for those who are... Again, everything for Leora, for the most part, except for a few mistakes that I've made, is by the book.

**[01:21:45 - 01:21:49]** So things that happened are from...

**[01:21:50 - 01:22:11]** precog for the most part like it's from things that that it comes out of stuff like that the hound of tindalos typically is a creature that comes to fuck with you when you with time or the drift or things like that yeah great for future reference good for future references yes and i i want to shout out

**[01:22:11 - 01:22:23]** I want to shout out some people in our 3FC GM's private channel for the Hound of Tindalos suggestion.

**[01:22:24 - 01:22:32]** And also thank them in general for their help with not only 3Fold, but also with NanoVenture and things like that for ideas and talking through stuff.

**[01:22:32 - 01:22:35]** And the Hound of Tindalos in particular was... You're not going to give us names?

**[01:22:35 - 01:22:37]** No, no, no.

**[01:22:37 - 01:22:38]** That was...

**[01:22:38 - 01:23:00]** uh that was finder and that was jimmy so that was good thank you yep yep yep jimmy jeremy sorry no no no sorry sorry sorry apps absolutely wrong i'm literally gonna cut that it was taco monk it was not oh thanks taco monk taco monk yeah yeah no no thanks to you jimmy no thanks false that's not true jimmy is great


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:23:00 - 01:23:02]** This is pretty nice.

**[01:23:03 - 01:23:05]** I have a question, John.

**[01:23:05 - 01:23:18]** Maybe there was an explanation for the green portals in Book 2 of 3FC, but is that basically what's happening there where they're f***ing with the time and so there's these creatures coming out from there too?

**[01:23:18 - 01:23:19]** No, that was definitely the Graze technology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:23:19 - 01:23:23]** The Graze had a portal system where they were sending creatures at us.

**[01:23:23 - 01:23:24]** Is that right, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:23:25 - 01:23:27]** I'm not going to comment on whether they're connected or not.

**[01:23:27 - 01:23:27]** F***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:23:29 - 01:23:32]** The greys could be leveraging it.

**[01:23:32 - 01:23:32]** That's the thing.

**[01:23:33 - 01:23:35]** There could be this thread of the greys.

**[01:23:35 - 01:23:37]** There could be this thread of precog stuff.

**[01:23:37 - 01:23:39]** All happening all across all of our stories.

**[01:23:39 - 01:23:42]** And the greys could be using it.

**[01:23:43 - 01:23:44]** Five rulers.

**[01:23:45 - 01:23:45]** And one plot armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:23:46 - 01:23:50]** Question for Jon is we killed the Hound of Tindalos.

**[01:23:51 - 01:23:52]** Which is great.

**[01:23:52 - 01:23:53]** Sounds so epic.

**[01:23:54 - 01:23:54]** Yeah.

**[01:23:54 - 01:23:56]** Was that a response?

**[01:23:56 - 01:23:59]** Like, if we didn't kill the hound, that wouldn't happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:23:59 - 01:24:00]** It does sound like that.

**[01:24:00 - 01:24:02]** I don't want to say, because I will give things away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:24:03 - 01:24:05]** John was like, how dare you kill my dog?

**[01:24:05 - 01:24:08]** And then he sent John Wick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:24:09 - 01:24:10]** And then I sent John Wick.

**[01:24:10 - 01:24:11]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:24:12 - 01:24:12]** I mean...

**[01:24:12 - 01:24:15]** I don't want to say anything about why that happened.

**[01:24:16 - 01:24:17]** Six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:24:17 - 01:24:27]** This just shows for anyone making future sideshows, which we're slated to do, we're going to have to be working with you a lot, John, about these kinds of things.

**[01:24:28 - 01:24:32]** It's going to be interesting to balance how much you can and can't reveal to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:24:32 - 01:24:35]** Or you just spin your own web of shit.

**[01:24:36 - 01:24:39]** You just write in Jeff's Gap.

**[01:24:39 - 01:24:40]** We do.

**[01:24:40 - 01:24:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:24:41 - 01:24:43]** And then let me know and I'll figure it out.

**[01:24:44 - 01:24:46]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:24:46 - 01:24:48]** But like I can see it.

**[01:24:49 - 01:24:53]** Kudos to John for like, you know, putting up this this whole huge like infrastructure in the background.

**[01:24:53 - 01:24:57]** And I definitely want to play into it because he's done so much good work.

**[01:24:57 - 01:24:58]** So.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:24:58 - 01:25:21]** uh we haven't seen it entirely yet but like i'm uh all of it at least so it's gonna be cool but i will but i will tell you that you're starting to see some things yeah no for sure i can see that i'll say that we still don't know what we're seeing or how much sense it yeah i'm i'm looking forward to like two or three plot armors from now where like yeah everything makes sense


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:25:20 - 01:25:50]** yeah and then it's gonna be like plot armor 7 the very last one yeah it's gonna be the very last one we're gonna be asking questions and he's gonna be like yeah blah blah back in book 1 we're gonna be like oh yeah I'm looking forward to that I'm really like I'm curious how upset we're all going to be with John I am too I am too don't worry I'm also I'm also curious yeah John's the one that wants us to all keep recording remotely so yeah weird


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:25:50 - 01:25:51]** I know where you live, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:25:51 - 01:25:52]** Oh, fuck, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:25:52 - 01:25:53]** You do.

**[01:25:54 - 01:25:55]** You might charge your car next to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:25:55 - 01:25:58]** I was just going to say, I might go charge my car here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:25:59 - 01:26:01]** Yeah, so that was fun.

**[01:26:01 - 01:26:03]** Blood Armor 7 gets recorded in a UFC octagon.

**[01:26:04 - 01:26:11]** Yeah, exactly.

**[01:26:11 - 01:26:12]** Start hitting the gym, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:26:12 - 01:26:15]** Yeah, let's start going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:26:15 - 01:26:16]** Yeah, so that was fun.

**[01:26:17 - 01:26:18]** So we get rid of the Hound of the Baskervilles.

**[01:26:18 - 01:26:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:26:19 - 01:26:23]** Yeah, we are still kind of combating.

**[01:26:23 - 01:26:32]** We took out the VESC, we took out the Yosuke, and actually got the computer and found out we can't reorganize.

**[01:26:32 - 01:26:34]** Which, I'll admit, I was confused on this one.

**[01:26:35 - 01:26:40]** John was saying that there were three target areas that the portal, which we didn't even talk about.

**[01:26:40 - 01:26:42]** The portal, the gate...

**[01:26:42 - 01:26:42]** lit up.

**[01:26:42 - 01:26:47]** It started, it became a portal of some sort, is what we assume it were to be.

**[01:26:47 - 01:26:51]** And the computer that Yusuke was sitting at was controlling that.

**[01:26:52 - 01:27:02]** And when Boom went to look at that computer, he found that the gate was targeting three locations.

**[01:27:02 - 01:27:08]** And for me, I assumed that those locations were on the map that we were fighting on.

**[01:27:08 - 01:27:09]** And we just couldn't see it.

**[01:27:09 - 01:27:10]** Does that make sense?

**[01:27:10 - 01:27:11]** Yeah, that's what I thought.

**[01:27:11 - 01:27:12]** I thought there were three spaces.

**[01:27:12 - 01:27:17]** And I was like, oh man, we gotta get this giant fucking wolf onto the circle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:27:17 - 01:27:19]** John, correct me if I'm wrong.

**[01:27:19 - 01:27:24]** Didn't you say we could peer in and see different things like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:27:24 - 01:27:48]** right and that's the clarification i had to clarify because i just missed it yeah i think you said if i remember right i think i said you couldn't see where the locations were but you could see that they were they were other yeah like they were not here literally on like morrow in this area like they like they were well beyond like that that far of a range away yeah

**[01:27:48 - 01:27:55]** And so this, this gate is a draw after the, after the, um, the, uh, like kind of surge, right?

**[01:27:55 - 01:27:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:27:56 - 01:28:01]** So this is, this is an assumption I'm making, but this gate is a steward's draw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:28:01 - 01:28:09]** I can confirm that, that, that, yes, that was the, the intent was that like this building was chosen for that reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:28:09 - 01:28:10]** Right.

**[01:28:10 - 01:28:15]** And the draw being the portals that are the wormholes that the stewards use.

**[01:28:15 - 01:28:18]** Leora is utilizing those draws, uh,

**[01:28:18 - 01:28:38]** to send people with the nanites to locations where they can harvest those nanites which we'll get to in a little bit um so during the fight we were still combating leora but we took out the isoki uh the giant wolf thing appears what thoughts of anyone i don't know but reddy's face was like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:28:39 - 01:28:56]** i'm sorry continue kev that's just like no no no what i missed obviously we need to hear it oh yes yeah it's clear for me too as we talk oh so so


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:28:57 - 01:29:00]** While this is happening, giant wolf thing is there.

**[01:29:00 - 01:29:01]** And I don't know.

**[01:29:01 - 01:29:03]** The wolf thing doesn't appear until after Lua gets there.

**[01:29:03 - 01:29:03]** Yeah.

**[01:29:04 - 01:29:04]** I forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:29:04 - 01:29:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:29:05 - 01:29:07]** Around after Lua opens the door.

**[01:29:07 - 01:29:10]** She's got it's Lua and the 10 agents.

**[01:29:11 - 01:29:12]** And some of you were like, oh, thank God.

**[01:29:13 - 01:29:19]** The rest of us were like, oh, and it was confirmed when she said, Leora, you've been wasting everybody's time.

**[01:29:19 - 01:29:22]** Now, stars team, get in the fucking gate.

**[01:29:23 - 01:29:29]** Uh, and luckily at that time, the giant wolf thing appeared and chucked Leora over the side.

**[01:29:29 - 01:29:31]** Rung or dry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:29:32 - 01:29:34]** Ray goes through a gate too in UT.

**[01:29:34 - 01:29:34]** I'm trying to remember.

**[01:29:35 - 01:29:37]** Um, I can't recall.

**[01:29:37 - 01:29:39]** There was like a gate opening in Unknown Treasures.

**[01:29:39 - 01:29:42]** A gate opening in Unknown Treasures?

**[01:29:42 - 01:29:42]** Or no.

**[01:29:43 - 01:29:45]** Oh, no, there was, like, some ethereal being.

**[01:29:45 - 01:29:49]** It just came out of the construct or whatever that we had at the time, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:29:49 - 01:29:50]** Yeah, there was a drift.

**[01:29:50 - 01:29:55]** The Grey had been messing with a drift engine.

**[01:29:55 - 01:29:57]** Right, right.

**[01:29:57 - 01:30:04]** And just for clarification on that, the Grey had been in that wreckage for over 200 years, I believe it was, or 300 years.

**[01:30:05 - 01:30:08]** And she was just trying to find a way home, which is really sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:30:09 - 01:30:10]** It's very sad, truthfully.

**[01:30:10 - 01:30:10]** It's very sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:30:10 - 01:30:11]** Yeah.

**[01:30:11 - 01:30:17]** So in the process of trying to get home, she released that drift demon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:30:17 - 01:30:19]** But it just came from the engine itself.

**[01:30:19 - 01:30:20]** It just came from the drift.

**[01:30:21 - 01:30:22]** Well, it involved the puck.

**[01:30:22 - 01:30:23]** Oh, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:30:23 - 01:30:25]** Yeah, she had the puck.

**[01:30:25 - 01:30:30]** And she was using the puck with the drift engine to create a portal of some sort.

**[01:30:30 - 01:30:33]** And she was very, very close on finding her way back to...

**[01:30:33 - 01:30:35]** her home and then you killed her.

**[01:30:35 - 01:30:36]** Moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:30:36 - 01:30:36]** Wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:30:36 - 01:30:37]** No, no, no.

**[01:30:37 - 01:30:37]** Not moving on.

**[01:30:38 - 01:30:40]** I want to know what Vinny was saying.

**[01:30:41 - 01:30:43]** What were you getting at there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:30:44 - 01:30:44]** What was it?

**[01:30:45 - 01:30:45]** I want to know.

**[01:30:45 - 01:30:45]** Yeah.

**[01:30:45 - 01:30:47]** I'm afraid I missed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:30:48 - 01:30:53]** So I, I think I might've just been like putting things together that maybe didn't need to be put together.

**[01:30:53 - 01:30:54]** Sure.

**[01:30:55 - 01:31:11]** Like if Leora is using the steward jump system to basically reverse wormholes from this installation to other steward installations that are used to harvest nanites for this purpose, then,

**[01:31:11 - 01:31:15]** Where are we in the three-fold conspiracy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:31:15 - 01:31:19]** We're at a steward's base that might have a drone.

**[01:31:19 - 01:31:19]** Yes.

**[01:31:19 - 01:31:21]** Fuck.

**[01:31:22 - 01:31:23]** Fuck you, John.

**[01:31:23 - 01:31:24]** Don't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:31:25 - 01:31:31]** That was the light bulb that... Yeah, yeah, that... Oh, fuck.

**[01:31:31 - 01:31:34]** Are we on the far side of one of those wormholes?

**[01:31:35 - 01:31:40]** Is Tyrcalis Base one of those three destinations?

**[01:31:40 - 01:31:41]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:31:41 - 01:31:45]** Book four of Threefold takes place on Akiton in Morrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:31:47 - 01:31:50]** In the Morrow Bean Factory with Willy Wonka.

**[01:31:50 - 01:31:53]** In the Morrow Bean Factory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:31:53 - 01:31:56]** I just want some of my own Morrow Beans.

**[01:31:56 - 01:31:57]** I just want to open up a bit.

**[01:31:57 - 01:31:58]** Boom's in charge now.

**[01:31:58 - 01:31:59]** He'll get you hooked up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:00 - 01:32:01]** You guys come visit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:32:01 - 01:32:04]** They're a sponsor of our Gen Con trip.

**[01:32:04 - 01:32:24]** yeah they are oh yeah actually no they're probably not an official one that's probably uh trademarked right is it is it no no that was on me that was okay great yeah so they are an official sponsor yes for sponsoring us john yeah that was that was the light bulb that was the oh shit that moment


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:32:24 - 01:32:25]** That makes sense.

**[01:32:25 - 01:32:26]** That's very cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:32:26 - 01:32:30]** And John is playing this coy, so we'll never find out until it's too late.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:32:30 - 01:32:48]** This is the one thing that I hate about plot armor is that we ask John to confirm all of these suspicions, and I have this headcanon that it's either yes or no, he's already had this idea, or he's just like, that's a good fucking idea.

**[01:32:48 - 01:32:49]** I should do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:32:49 - 01:32:53]** Let me write these down.


## Speaker_0

**[01:32:53 - 01:32:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:32:53 - 01:32:55]** Here, I got this notebook for you.

**[01:32:55 - 01:32:57]** I know how to torment you.

**[01:32:57 - 01:33:00]** Why do you think I want to have a plot arc?

**[01:33:00 - 01:33:01]** Thanks for revealing your darkest fears, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:33:02 - 01:33:03]** Yeah.

**[01:33:03 - 01:33:06]** Or like when Kelly said his darkest fear is alien abduction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:33:07 - 01:33:09]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:33:09 - 01:33:12]** There's actually no grades in three folks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:33:12 - 01:33:14]** John put them all in just to fuck with Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:33:14 - 01:33:31]** specifically graze is what i said that was my biggest recurring nightmare was the graze picking me up and abducting me and like two episodes later like literally or maybe even one episode later just grazing he spent four years of his life


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:33:31 - 01:33:34]** I'm just suffering through his worst fears.

**[01:33:37 - 01:33:38]** Sorry, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:33:38 - 01:33:39]** That's fine.

**[01:33:40 - 01:33:42]** Thanks for enduring with us, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:33:42 - 01:33:43]** It's good trauma.

**[01:33:44 - 01:33:45]** Trauma.

**[01:33:45 - 01:33:45]** Exposure therapy.

**[01:33:45 - 01:33:46]** I guess.

**[01:33:46 - 01:33:47]** Yeah, there you go.

**[01:33:47 - 01:33:47]** That's what it is.

**[01:33:47 - 01:33:48]** Exposure therapy.

**[01:33:48 - 01:33:53]** At the very end of this, I'm going to have to fight a real gray in real life, and then I'll...

**[01:33:55 - 01:33:56]** But you're just ramping up.

**[01:33:56 - 01:33:57]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:33:57 - 01:33:58]** I'm going to hire an actor.

**[01:33:58 - 01:33:58]** That's it.

**[01:33:58 - 01:33:59]** We're going to draw stars.

**[01:34:00 - 01:34:01]** That would be so fun.

**[01:34:01 - 01:34:04]** Who dresses up in a gray alien costume in the Octagon.

**[01:34:04 - 01:34:05]** It's going to be... It's Kelly.

**[01:34:05 - 01:34:06]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:34:06 - 01:34:07]** In the middle of the night at Gen Con.

**[01:34:07 - 01:34:10]** It's going to be Gen Con, like, 2027.

**[01:34:11 - 01:34:14]** And then, like, it's just going to, like, bust into my room.

**[01:34:14 - 01:34:15]** There's going to be some gray-suited motherfucker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:34:15 - 01:34:17]** It's so funny.

**[01:34:18 - 01:34:19]** It's not just going to be one.

**[01:34:19 - 01:34:20]** It's going to be our entire family.

**[01:34:20 - 01:34:22]** It's just picking me up from my bed as I sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:34:22 - 01:34:27]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:34:27 - 01:34:28]** 200.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:34:28 - 01:34:30]** Don't you all dare.

**[01:34:30 - 01:34:31]** Don't you all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:34:31 - 01:34:34]** You better not.

**[01:34:34 - 01:34:34]** So good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:34:37 - 01:34:37]** Where were we?

**[01:34:38 - 01:34:40]** So back to the adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:34:40 - 01:34:43]** Lua gets chucked over the edge.

**[01:34:43 - 01:34:45]** I'm realizing now you said Maro Troopers.

**[01:34:45 - 01:34:48]** Are they Mari Maro Bean Troopers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:34:48 - 01:34:48]** No, no, no.

**[01:34:48 - 01:34:51]** They're like Maro Strike Force.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:34:51 - 01:34:54]** They're Strike Force, but they have a little bean symbol.

**[01:34:56 - 01:35:03]** So Migo actually attacks them before they can attack us and takes one of them out.

**[01:35:03 - 01:35:04]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:35:04 - 01:35:06]** He was not down with that.

**[01:35:06 - 01:35:09]** He was already sick of all of the bulls**t.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:35:10 - 01:35:32]** yeah and as soon as lua was like getting engaged like yeah you could take that and shove it up your ass yeah amigo at first was like i'm not that dog i'll kill these people over here and then uh things went the other way um that's when things got real crazy so this dog giant dog thing is over in one corner the the ten troopers are down at the bottom

**[01:35:32 - 01:35:35]** And the rest of us are just trying to figure out what the f*** is happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:35:35 - 01:35:37]** And we're getting pulled into this gate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:35:37 - 01:35:42]** Right, because at some point Archie slides up where the Yosuke was and was like, no, let me work the gate.

**[01:35:43 - 01:35:44]** Did I imagine that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:35:44 - 01:35:50]** No, it plugged... Archie chugged in, or connected in, and when Archie connected...

**[01:35:50 - 01:35:52]** We weren't sure what was happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:35:53 - 01:35:55]** Yeah, but the gate started f***ing working.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:35:55 - 01:35:56]** It started overloading.

**[01:35:56 - 01:36:00]** It turned off and then turned back on and started overloading.

**[01:36:01 - 01:36:03]** So, was that Bolt trying to help us?

**[01:36:04 - 01:36:08]** Or is that Bolt trying to help Leora?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:36:09 - 01:36:14]** I can't comment on Bolt, but I can say that... Also remember that...

**[01:36:14 - 01:36:26]** when the large, huge creature appeared was also when there was the like kind of shock and like that, that, that sent a surge throughout the system.

**[01:36:26 - 01:36:29]** So was Bolt trying to remedy that?

**[01:36:29 - 01:36:32]** Was Commander Bolt trying to help facilitate that?

**[01:36:33 - 01:36:42]** But that's what, yeah, that's, that's what caused the gate to jump from being locked into one location to bouncing around between three locations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:36:43 - 01:36:50]** And we never learn about Bolt because we'll get to Bolt later, but she was on the surface with, we'll say, the survivors.

**[01:36:50 - 01:36:53]** Because we're about to get to the saddest part of this whole adventure.

**[01:36:53 - 01:36:55]** So...

**[01:36:57 - 01:37:00]** Like Will said, some of us were being pulled.

**[01:37:00 - 01:37:01]** Was it a Will save?

**[01:37:02 - 01:37:04]** It was a Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:37:04 - 01:37:06]** I thought it was a Fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:37:07 - 01:37:10]** Sorry, it was a Fortitude save.

**[01:37:11 - 01:37:13]** I wanted it to be a Will save just because Will save.

**[01:37:13 - 01:37:14]** But then...

**[01:37:14 - 01:37:41]** all other pull effects i i just kind of check for like reference all other pull effects like like the solarians graviton stuff and grenades are all fort saved so i was like yeah i'm just gonna make for safe and you could discuss that if you want or not but like the mechanic of the pole was that there are nanites telling us to go into the gate or was the gate itself pulling us or was it somebody like leora teleporting us

**[01:37:41 - 01:37:45]** It was an augment to the draws to like resonate.

**[01:37:45 - 01:37:50]** It's like have resonance with your nanobots and pull them in.

**[01:37:51 - 01:37:51]** Yeah.

**[01:37:51 - 01:37:52]** And I, I set it up.

**[01:37:52 - 01:37:58]** So I think it was like a 50% chance or something that you're going to get pulled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:37:58 - 01:38:03]** And so Cara passed a couple of times, failed a couple of times, but managed to just hold off.


## Speaker_0

**[01:38:04 - 01:38:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:38:05 - 01:38:05]** Cecil didn't.

**[01:38:06 - 01:38:09]** Cecil failed almost every time.

**[01:38:10 - 01:38:13]** And the last time he was yanked through the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:38:16 - 01:38:20]** That feature of the draws was turned off.

**[01:38:20 - 01:38:25]** And after you successfully passed it, you didn't need to make a save again.

**[01:38:25 - 01:38:32]** And after the surge, that pull suck feature was... Turned back on?

**[01:38:32 - 01:38:33]** No, it was turned off.

**[01:38:34 - 01:38:36]** That surge turned it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:38:36 - 01:38:38]** So Cecil was thrown into the gate.

**[01:38:38 - 01:38:39]** By Leora.

**[01:38:39 - 01:38:40]** Invisible Leora.

**[01:38:41 - 01:38:43]** Leora was hanging out in the background this whole time.

**[01:38:44 - 01:38:46]** And this isn't even the sad part that I was referring to.

**[01:38:46 - 01:38:47]** Uh...

**[01:38:47 - 01:38:52]** Because while that is happening, the rest of the team realizes we need to get the hell out of there.

**[01:38:52 - 01:38:58]** And even I, as Cecil, was like, man, if I can do a full withdraw, I can make it out of this.

**[01:38:58 - 01:39:02]** And John's going to have to figure out how to get Cecil into Rick a different way.

**[01:39:04 - 01:39:06]** But Migo...

**[01:39:08 - 01:39:15]** Beagle steps up and takes the reaction AOL from the giant.

**[01:39:16 - 01:39:18]** Literally, it's a huge monster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:39:19 - 01:39:25]** Yeah, that was a tough... As a player, that was a tough choice.

**[01:39:26 - 01:39:28]** As a character, that was also a tough choice.

**[01:39:28 - 01:39:31]** Because it's one of those...

**[01:39:33 - 01:39:34]** What would Migo do in that moment?

**[01:39:34 - 01:39:35]** What's honest to him?

**[01:39:37 - 01:39:41]** How can I do this without metagaming?

**[01:39:41 - 01:39:46]** Because we all understand the mechanics somewhat of how AOs work.

**[01:39:46 - 01:39:48]** We still argue about it two years later.

**[01:39:48 - 01:39:49]** Kelly's still learning.

**[01:39:51 - 01:39:52]** But he's doing alright.

**[01:39:52 - 01:39:56]** But also, what is redemption?

**[01:39:56 - 01:40:02]** What is going to be the best outcome for the Stars team?

**[01:40:02 - 01:40:06]** And so I felt like John did a good job of outlining the stakes.

**[01:40:07 - 01:40:09]** This is a big, bad motherfucker.

**[01:40:10 - 01:40:14]** Like this is, this is not something that we walk away from whole.

**[01:40:14 - 01:40:21]** And the prophecy from jump was the stars will lose a life.

**[01:40:21 - 01:40:26]** And so I felt like it made sense for the narrative.

**[01:40:26 - 01:40:28]** I felt like it made sense for Migo.

**[01:40:28 - 01:40:29]** I felt like it made sense for the star scene.

**[01:40:30 - 01:40:39]** And so that move to draw the AOO so the rest of the team could get out alive was just like, okay, cool.

**[01:40:39 - 01:40:41]** I expected Migo to go down.

**[01:40:43 - 01:40:45]** That did not happen.

**[01:40:45 - 01:40:47]** Miko was already not in great shape.

**[01:40:48 - 01:40:49]** I'll just put it that way.

**[01:40:50 - 01:40:51]** Miko had taken some damage.

**[01:40:51 - 01:40:52]** He's a melee fighter.

**[01:40:52 - 01:40:53]** He's a scrapper.

**[01:40:53 - 01:40:57]** He's going to be down and dirty and in every single fight.

**[01:40:57 - 01:41:02]** And I hate that he died with three healing serums, but I'll just let that ride.

**[01:41:04 - 01:41:09]** But also, that felt honest to him.

**[01:41:10 - 01:41:19]** And so to step into that battle, you know, there was some discourse on the Discord server about it being a cutscene kill and, like, you know, this kind of being scripted.

**[01:41:19 - 01:41:21]** That was not scripted at all.

**[01:41:21 - 01:41:23]** That was entirely improv on the fly.

**[01:41:24 - 01:41:26]** Like, I... It was a choice that you made.

**[01:41:26 - 01:41:30]** I made that choice as the player to move and draw the AOO.

**[01:41:32 - 01:41:36]** It happened to, you know, Migo went splat, and that's the end of Migo 7.

**[01:41:37 - 01:41:38]** But...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:41:38 - 01:41:40]** Which I just want to pause right there.

**[01:41:40 - 01:41:44]** Kelly, can you explain how Migo died?

**[01:41:44 - 01:41:45]** Rules wise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:41:48 - 01:41:53]** Well, why don't you put a short bonus on him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:41:53 - 01:41:55]** In short, it's just, I'm just going to throw a roll at you.

**[01:41:56 - 01:42:11]** No, in short, it's because there's like, I think it's because like when you attack someone and you do so much damage that it overwhelms, I don't know what exactly it is like there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:42:11 - 01:42:33]** remaining hp plus like some amount like then that's it you can't really do like saving throws at that point right you're just instantly massive damage so basically you have a current hit point count and if the creature that hits you does more than your current hit point count plus your total hit points then you're just paced

**[01:42:35 - 01:42:55]** instant death there's no role there's no opportunity to save you're just done which like makes sense if there's a creature that can do that much damage and you step into it then that's what happens and i was only three i think hp over your total hit point


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:42:55 - 01:42:59]** It was a close, it was very close between literally life and death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:43:00 - 01:43:09]** And like, you know, it felt like an honest end for me to go and, and, you know, there's some stuff about me that we never got to explore and maybe we will later.

**[01:43:09 - 01:43:09]** Maybe we will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:43:09 - 01:43:10]** I mean, with how time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:43:10 - 01:43:11]** It hit me hard.

**[01:43:11 - 01:43:12]** I was.

**[01:43:13 - 01:43:38]** when you when you made the comment about like i'm gonna step up i don't think i think i was the first one to catch like oh shit this is what he's doing um and it hurt i think it like we've only known these characters for what 10 episodes like who they're nobody's to us but at the same time like they're the team and like it it felt like such a heavy sacrifice when it happened um

**[01:43:39 - 01:43:43]** And it worked, because you were able to get Kara and Boom out alive.

**[01:43:43 - 01:43:43]** Yes.

**[01:43:44 - 01:43:46]** And Kara also took a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:43:47 - 01:43:50]** And Kara powered through, because Kara's a boss.

**[01:43:51 - 01:43:53]** So, Andy boss.

**[01:43:53 - 01:43:54]** Kelly, you had a question?

**[01:43:54 - 01:43:55]** Boom's second in command.

**[01:43:55 - 01:43:56]** Okay, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:43:58 - 01:43:58]** He is.

**[01:43:59 - 01:44:01]** He's the second most experienced person.

**[01:44:01 - 01:44:04]** Come on, Niko was not above.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:44:04 - 01:44:07]** This is the moment you chose to rank measure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:44:09 - 01:44:12]** You're dead, so what are you going to do about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:44:12 - 01:44:13]** It's alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:44:14 - 01:44:19]** That's where we'd take it.

**[01:44:19 - 01:44:21]** We'll have a talk at your next one-on-one.

**[01:44:21 - 01:44:24]** Progress reports are going up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:44:24 - 01:44:26]** What was your question, Kelly?

**[01:44:26 - 01:44:27]** I don't think I had a question.

**[01:44:27 - 01:44:30]** I was just commenting like, yeah, or something.

**[01:44:31 - 01:44:32]** I can't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:44:33 - 01:44:35]** He just wanted to be really clear that something's second in command.

**[01:44:35 - 01:44:36]** That was it.

**[01:44:36 - 01:44:38]** Yeah, he was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:44:38 - 01:44:41]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:44:42 - 01:44:43]** Cool.

**[01:44:43 - 01:44:55]** So that's where we leave off, is the creature is just literally flinging people off the side of the platform, eating people alive, and smashes Migo to a pulp.

**[01:44:56 - 01:45:00]** Cecil is chucked through the gate by, assumingly, Leora.

**[01:45:02 - 01:45:02]** Kara...

**[01:45:03 - 01:45:10]** picks up a bomb and drops a bomb into the crack and blows up the platform, causing it to crack and crumble.

**[01:45:10 - 01:45:17]** And when she does that, she sees something, someone, a body...

**[01:45:18 - 01:45:20]** Fall off the edge or jump.

**[01:45:20 - 01:45:21]** It wasn't quite clear.

**[01:45:21 - 01:45:24]** And then a gate opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:45:25 - 01:45:25]** Beneath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:45:26 - 01:45:30]** A teleportation gate and they fall through it.

**[01:45:31 - 01:45:34]** So we can assume that that was Leora.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:45:34 - 01:46:00]** making her escape um and then cara and boom make it out alive uh what happened to archie archie tried and then got smashed archie uh got like zapped and fried and then was sputtering trying and i was rolling to see if archie was gonna re you know power cycle and come back and then i think on the way out cara picked up archie and brought archie out yep


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:46:01 - 01:46:03]** For interrogation later.

**[01:46:04 - 01:46:04]** Right.

**[01:46:04 - 01:46:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:46:06 - 01:46:07]** So then we cut to the surface.

**[01:46:07 - 01:46:09]** The whole place starts to explode.

**[01:46:09 - 01:46:10]** It all crumbles.

**[01:46:10 - 01:46:11]** Go ahead, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:46:11 - 01:46:20]** There was just one thing that I wanted to say, which was that I won't go into too much of it here, but if you want to talk about design stuff, because I had a tough...

**[01:46:20 - 01:46:38]** choice in thinking about like this end fight because it it there's a lot in there both like just what you all did like there was a lot that you all went through and a lot of connections to other things that i that haven't come out yet and so the one thing i tried to do was uh was was always like not

**[01:46:38 - 01:47:00]** plan and outcome but like opportunities and i'm highlighting it because i want to highlight y'all and that's to say that i specifically came up with one ending that i was like okay or like or like one way to connect things together that i was like this is fine but there's something like something feels off about it and i realized that doing it would remove

**[01:47:00 - 01:47:19]** your uh your abilities it or your agency choices thank you that's the fucking word that was like before it took away your agency and i didn't want to do that and i truthfully thought to the end of unknown treasures and i was like wow that was such a great moment where we as a table like just trusted each other and we're like we all kind of know what's going

**[01:47:19 - 01:47:22]** on, but we don't, but we're going to just improv it.

**[01:47:22 - 01:47:25]** And I was like, that feels like the standard that I need to hit.

**[01:47:26 - 01:47:35]** So then I said, all right, I kind of, I'm going to put in options here and I just want to see what you all do and let you play your characters as you should.

**[01:47:35 - 01:47:42]** And however it ends, like whatever ends at the fight, I will then take and make it work to fit in.

**[01:47:42 - 01:47:45]** And so with that said, I just want to thank you guys for like,

**[01:47:45 - 01:47:56]** I didn't say anything about it because I didn't want to color it, but I, but I like, I was just choosing internally to like put aside any sense of like, I don't know how I'll make this work and be like, you know what?

**[01:47:56 - 01:47:57]** I'm going to trust you all.

**[01:47:57 - 01:48:02]** And I think it turned out terrifically and wonderfully and was, and you all played your characters.

**[01:48:02 - 01:48:28]** as you should and and it was great and i and i can go into more minutiae privately if you want about how like there were a lot of times where i was like i don't know like if things might not have happened if i had done one dice roll different if i had done one thing different you all may have made different choices may you know who knows so just want to thank you all for being the awesome crew that you are about the the stars team who can beat them you know what i'm saying


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:48:28 - 01:48:54]** kev so the platform falls into the pit the whole thing erupts and explodes cara and boom make it out uh with archie and that's when we cut to a scene of just emergency crews and and you know paramedics and firemen and police and everybody swarming the area and uh cara and boom are wearing blankets and talking to commander bolt is that correct


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:48:55 - 01:49:17]** yes uh not commander bolt but to just like face this like post disaster folks you know medics and analysts and forensics and things like that so where was bolt during all that that's a good question yeah good question that you're not gonna answer do you remember what happened or maybe you're gonna get to it after that yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:49:18 - 01:49:19]** I don't remember anything with Commander Bull.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:49:20 - 01:49:24]** I'm actually really excited to hear this because I was super drunk when we did it the first time.

**[01:49:25 - 01:49:29]** Yeah.

**[01:49:29 - 01:49:29]** Miko.

**[01:49:29 - 01:49:29]** Miko was dead.

**[01:49:29 - 01:49:31]** I was like, f*** it, I'm going to turn up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:49:31 - 01:49:33]** Yeah, chug, chug, chug.

**[01:49:35 - 01:49:41]** So is there anything else you want to add to that scene with Kara and Boom on the surface?

**[01:49:42 - 01:49:44]** Just what was happening in the background, which I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:49:45 - 01:50:11]** you were going to get your anyway uh that the that the natural that the geothermal spot um uh that the geothermal energy was activated by this gate falling in and erupted essentially causing an overflow of all this like lava and right that both fell onto the building

**[01:50:11 - 01:50:18]** the new ring works building and fell onto just a bunch of, you know, down into the trench.

**[01:50:19 - 01:50:27]** It's, it's, it's literally lava spilling over the three miles or whatever it is down to the bottom of the trench, you know, rest in peace to all those people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:50:28 - 01:50:36]** Um, so after that, we cut to a scene of Cecil and his family.

**[01:50:38 - 01:50:44]** And I believe Kara and Boom were there as well.

**[01:50:46 - 01:50:48]** It was a peaceful moment.

**[01:50:49 - 01:50:51]** And that's quickly wiped away.

**[01:50:53 - 01:51:03]** Fades off and we find Cecil laying on a lab table with tubes connected to him.

**[01:51:04 - 01:51:07]** as nanites are being sucked from his body.

**[01:51:08 - 01:51:18]** And on the top of the table, it reads, Ringworks Industries Calametric Kineticists.

**[01:51:19 - 01:51:23]** Which is the acronym for RIC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:51:25 - 01:51:25]** Yep.

**[01:51:25 - 01:51:28]** I wish I had a drop that was like, Bum, bum, bum!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:51:29 - 01:51:31]** I will add it in.

**[01:51:31 - 01:51:32]** Overlay it on your voice.

**[01:51:33 - 01:51:35]** That was perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:51:35 - 01:51:43]** And then we... I think this is the part that I was caught off guard by the next part.

**[01:51:43 - 01:51:46]** And so we cut back to Cecil's family.

**[01:51:46 - 01:51:47]** Now, without Cecil, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:51:48 - 01:51:53]** We zoom up and show an icy planet with a cold sun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:51:54 - 01:51:55]** Yeah.

**[01:51:56 - 01:51:57]** That was...

**[01:51:58 - 01:51:59]** He's somewhere in the universe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:52:00 - 01:52:02]** I want to see, like, looking at the Starfinder map again.

**[01:52:03 - 01:52:05]** What planet?

**[01:52:05 - 01:52:06]** Icy planets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:52:07 - 01:52:08]** Google icy planets.

**[01:52:08 - 01:52:08]** I'm looking it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:52:09 - 01:52:11]** Apostae?

**[01:52:11 - 01:52:13]** I'm not sure if that's icy, though.

**[01:52:13 - 01:52:18]** Apostae is a cool planet, but it's not... John's not going to tell us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:52:18 - 01:52:20]** It was one of three locations.

**[01:52:21 - 01:52:23]** But you should read about apostate because it's a rad planet.

**[01:52:23 - 01:52:25]** Anyway, continue, Kif.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:52:25 - 01:52:30]** We cut back to Cecil's family and now it's very clear that it's Cecil's family without Cecil.

**[01:52:31 - 01:52:38]** And it's his wife, Zeish, and his baby Babis and his son Tonam.

**[01:52:38 - 01:52:39]** And there's a knock at the door.

**[01:52:39 - 01:52:44]** And it's the Mari Marobine lady that booms.

**[01:52:44 - 01:52:45]** It's Mari herself.

**[01:52:46 - 01:52:48]** And she's like, oh, you guys won in Blah Blah Blah.

**[01:52:49 - 01:52:49]** Can I talk to you?

**[01:52:50 - 01:52:51]** And then everything froze.

**[01:52:52 - 01:52:54]** And Leora kidnaps Tonam.

**[01:52:56 - 01:52:56]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:52:57 - 01:52:58]** On the plus side.

**[01:52:59 - 01:53:03]** The real Mari Maro crew comes up right afterwards and takes him on a tour.

**[01:53:03 - 01:53:04]** So that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:53:05 - 01:53:09]** And finds the frozen mother and daughter.

**[01:53:10 - 01:53:11]** But the son is missing.

**[01:53:11 - 01:53:15]** The son is now with Leora somewhere in the universe.

**[01:53:16 - 01:53:18]** And that's the end of our NaNoVenture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:53:18 - 01:53:19]** That was the end of the NaNoVenture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:53:20 - 01:53:20]** Yep.

**[01:53:21 - 01:53:23]** And I think this hit me really hard because I was telling John about this.

**[01:53:23 - 01:53:29]** When I wrote Cecil's background, I didn't have a daughter yet.

**[01:53:31 - 01:53:39]** I didn't even, my son was just born after the very first episode of this year of we'll save the podcast.

**[01:53:39 - 01:53:42]** So Cecil and his family weren't there.

**[01:53:42 - 01:53:46]** They are the same build as my current family, my wife, my, my two kids.

**[01:53:47 - 01:53:51]** And that wasn't, it was, I didn't even think about that.

**[01:53:52 - 01:53:57]** There were two separate things until this episode when I was like, Oh shit.

**[01:53:57 - 01:53:57]** Like,

**[01:53:58 - 01:54:05]** I really felt like my wife and my daughter were frozen in time and my son was kidnapped and I was nowhere to be able to help.

**[01:54:07 - 01:54:09]** And that, I almost cried that night.

**[01:54:10 - 01:54:10]** I'm sorry, buddy.

**[01:54:11 - 01:54:12]** Yeah, it's your fault, John.

**[01:54:12 - 01:54:13]** Fuck you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:54:13 - 01:54:16]** Kev is the quintessential like family man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:54:17 - 01:54:18]** Yeah.

**[01:54:18 - 01:54:19]** Yeah.

**[01:54:19 - 01:54:20]** Very sweet.

**[01:54:21 - 01:54:22]** Yeah.

**[01:54:22 - 01:54:23]** I'm suddenly thankful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:54:23 - 01:54:25]** Well, that's the end of the Nano Ventures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:54:27 - 01:54:30]** I'm suddenly thankful I was fairly drunk that night.

**[01:54:31 - 01:54:35]** And didn't begin to realize it.

**[01:54:35 - 01:54:36]** That's a heavy ending.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:54:38 - 01:54:47]** Again, it was only because I realized I had a note in my prep list that was like, make Mari Mara beans matter.

**[01:54:47 - 01:54:50]** And I was like, this is the way.

**[01:54:51 - 01:54:51]** This is what it's got to be.

**[01:54:52 - 01:54:54]** After Kelly was like, I'm going to give this to Cecil's family.

**[01:54:55 - 01:54:55]** I was like, this is it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:54:56 - 01:54:57]** It's all Boom's fault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:54:57 - 01:54:58]** It's Boom's fault.

**[01:54:58 - 01:54:59]** Boom's in on it.

**[01:54:59 - 01:55:00]** Let the rule damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:55:02 - 01:55:06]** So wait, it's time for Boom.

**[01:55:06 - 01:55:08]** Boom is a time traveler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:55:09 - 01:55:13]** It's time for what the fuck?

**[01:55:14 - 01:55:14]** Wow.

**[01:55:14 - 01:55:17]** Time for boom in all caps.

**[01:55:17 - 01:55:18]** All right, y'all.

**[01:55:19 - 01:55:20]** Thanks for being wonderful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:55:20 - 01:55:21]** That's our nano adventure.

**[01:55:21 - 01:55:22]** Thank you all for listening.

**[01:55:22 - 01:55:23]** That's all that happened.

**[01:55:23 - 01:55:24]** That's everything.

**[01:55:24 - 01:55:25]** That's the end of the series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:55:25 - 01:55:26]** Yeah, that's it.

**[01:55:26 - 01:55:29]** Next week, back to the fold.

**[01:55:29 - 01:55:30]** We return back to the fold.

**[01:55:30 - 01:55:31]** All three of them.

**[01:55:32 - 01:55:34]** Just like we love.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:55:34 - 01:55:37]** You know what really grinds my gears?

**[01:55:37 - 01:55:55]** The fact that we've gone through all of this drama and plot twist and anxiety, and now we're just going to get dropped back into threefold, and it's going to get ratcheted up so much more intensely than we just went through in the last 16 weeks.

**[01:55:57 - 01:55:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:55:57 - 01:56:22]** yeah yeah it's a lot can you please fix here's his antenna yeah for sure for sure yeah let's do it i mean no no we'll handle it story-wise yeah of course yeah of course but i have to let this bit that was his name created go on a little bit longer i guess you think you're communicating telepathically

**[01:56:22 - 01:56:23]** Yeah, thanks, Jimmy.

**[01:56:23 - 01:56:24]** I think it's Jimmy.

**[01:56:24 - 01:56:24]** Anyway.

**[01:56:25 - 01:56:25]** Yeah.

**[01:56:25 - 01:56:26]** I think so.
