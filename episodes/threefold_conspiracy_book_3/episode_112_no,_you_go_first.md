## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Yeah, so I recently got a CPAP.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:13]** It's great.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:14]** Let me tell you.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:15]** I'm waking up.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** I'm breathing.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** I'm f***ing alert.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** And I'm like, wow, that's right.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:23]** This is like an altered, elevated state of consciousness for me.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** But then you got sick after that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** This, dear listener, is what you have to look forward to in your 30s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** Hey, there are plenty of people... I have whiskey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** BRB.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:36]** Passionate discussion about CPAPs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** Really lengthy discussions, honestly.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:42]** Behind the... In the green room, so to speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** In the Wolf's Head green room, yeah.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** It's been good.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:45]** It's been good.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:48]** Look, I... Not gonna lie, it's super helpful.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:55]** And... But it leaves, like, a mark on my nose that has turned into, like, kind of a wound.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** So I gotta fucking...

**[00:02:57 - 00:03:00]** I didn't want to look like I had just an open wound on our video here.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:03]** So I put these band-aids next to my eyeballs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** I think that's just responsible skincare.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** I think so.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** Maybe next episode we talk about skincare regimens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:09]** I'm kind of down.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** I'm actually going to say that right now.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** I'm going to do my copy.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** I've got photos.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Let's go.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** Let's go.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** In the meantime, though, I'm sick.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** You have before and afters?

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Yeah, I do.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** Bro, you do?

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:20]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** Yeah.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** Dang.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:22]** I got dirties.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:23]** What?

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:25]** Dude, I'm moisturized in my lane.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** Minding my own business.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:31]** Be sure to wear sunscreen if you ever go outside, everyone.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** Yeah, I mean, that's the big thing.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** Sunscreen's the number one thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:33]** It is.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** Yeah, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** Oh, I love the charcoal mask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:38 - 00:04:01]** charcoal face mask uh-huh it's tough uh-huh uh it peels off not as well as you would expect it to true there's that there's the skin cleanser the skin moisturizer um i picked up a pineapple melon hemp seed lotion that i really like and that's the that's the moisturizer yeah

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:06]** I also have a CeraVe facial moisturizer.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** CeraVe's good.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:10]** CeraVe's pretty hard to go wrong with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:15]** I'm all about the cleanser, toner, mist, mask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** I don't have toner.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** I don't know that I would do toner.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:22]** I feel like I've got enough of a natural caramel that...

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:42]** it's it's mostly like smooth out blemishes but yeah yeah yeah i don't think it's about yeah no i think you can still use it that is also the eye cream what's your retinol oh i don't know i have i have shitty eye care i have if you can like see this on video i have my the underside of my eyes look like some old man ball sack


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** You got to get that.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:48]** I'm into that eucalyptus eye mask.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:55]** The gold foil things really help for like kind of a 15 to 30 minute.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** Just keep your skin cool.

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:02]** But there is like retinol or there's something that you're supposed to do every night that really gets in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:25]** yeah i think that the thing that i'm supposed to do every night to get rid of them i just can't it's the like sleep enough that helps for sure that helps sleeping and getting quality sleep helps yeah is this an adult thing where like no one has restful sleep anymore like i get restful sleep probably once like a month you should be tested for sleep i feel rested

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** No, I don't.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** That's the whole discussion.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** It's the stress, right?

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** It's just like adult life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:41]** Also, as you get older, your muscles start to relax and then your airways close and then your brain has to wake you up in the middle of the night without actually fully waking you up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:41]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** And so you never get a deep sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:45]** You're struggling for air as you sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** Possibly.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:48]** It's just the architecture of your face.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** It has nothing to do with any other body factors.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** I think it's worth doing just to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:54 - 00:06:21]** right because like you don't have to use a c-pap but i think it's because raise your hand if you have sleep apnea i think three out of the five we'll say i mean i think statistically we're there yeah yeah but like okay it only 60 of adults but you know those days where you're like all right cool i have nothing to worry about i have everything accomplished and then like you just sleep no i don't know what's that like so like but do you still feel groggy the next day

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:39]** no i don't the next day i'll because i'll sleep like like a dead person for like 13 hours and then i'll wake up and i'll just like yeah i'll you want to talk about skin care i'll like i'll look like a like dew rained on me in like a rainforest and like i was just covered hey like they have you know or whatever procedures for that that are really nice yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:39 - 00:07:00]** i can't remember the last time i slept 13 hours straight yeah it was probably 10 years ago i like it and i'll tell you it was on the plane yeah plane sleep is the worst i cannot sleep on the plane okay okay mr delta one yeah delta one babe come on now i sleep in first class too


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:10]** I've got a lot of work travel coming up, and one of my flights back is a red eye overnight, and there's no seats available on the flight.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:16]** So I got my preferences set, and I just got an email saying, oh, we found you a window seat in the very back row.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** So I can't even recline.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** At least I can lean against the window.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:21]** It's going to be terrible.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:23]** You can often recline in the back row.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** It depends on the plane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:25]** Yeah, it depends on the plane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:33]** I've actually slept best, though, with a travel footrest against a bulkhead in comfort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** You know what I want?

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:38]** That does sound really good, and I'm going to have to start doing that because I take long-ass flights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:41]** It's like a $15 Amazon inflatable.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:45]** You just huff into the...

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:48]** inflatable footrest and you put it in front of you.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:59]** If you're a smaller person, you can curl up on it or hug it, but if you're like me, put your feet up and then not have it have to be against the bulkhead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:02]** Planes, for sure, are a small people's revenge.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** That's the thing.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:10]** So, like, if you have, like, Wolverine and then, like, Kevin and then, like, Elijah Wood in, like, one room, and they're all just, like, completely enjoying their life.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:19]** And, like, Will and I are, like, just shoved into, like... I think it's the other four members of us, because we're all, like... It's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:23]** Yeah, it's the prisoner's dilemma of airspace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:27]** That's what you guys... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:33]** Kevin's ordering drinks and shit all chipper as shit on the flights to Indiana.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:38]** I'm getting free drinks in first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:42]** I want to start taking boats everywhere I go from now on as much as possible.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:45]** I just want a boat across the ocean next time I go anywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** Can you do that?

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** I'm sure you can.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** They're called cruise ships.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:53]** Can you get a one-way cruise ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:57]** You can get a hop-on hop-off that goes world tour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:02]** The only ship I know that was meant to do that got hit by an iceberg 100 years ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** And then we've lost it.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:09]** One, maybe another soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:12]** Yeah, they're supposed to go after it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:19]** Didn't the Titanic's other ship, there was a sister ship that also... The Queen Mary?

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** The Lusitania.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:23]** It was Lusitania, and they were the same ship, basically.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** Just don't ever...

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:27]** Whoever made that ship.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** Just don't cross the Atlantic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** There's a lot of conspiracy theories.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** About the Lusitania?

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** Well, on the two together.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** Insurance fraud.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** Yeah, basically.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** Now you have me Googling this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:39]** This is some real conspiracy stuff that I'm down with.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:39]** Yeah, no.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** I was just.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** Teeling.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** That was some.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:42]** I don't know.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** Teeling is good.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:44]** Is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** It's an Irish whiskey, right?

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:45]** Okay.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:47]** Yeah, it's an Irish whiskey.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** I didn't know what it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:50]** Someone gave it to me as a gift.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** Nice.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** How is it?

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:54]** It's pretty good.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** Is it smoky?

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Is it peaty?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:00]** It's slightly peaty, but not really much at all.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** Just barely.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:04]** I don't know if it's a blend or not.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Just a small batch.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** Did you put the teardrop of water in it?

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** No, I didn't do that.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** Are you talking about how to drink whiskey like a sir?

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:18]** For anyone who hasn't seen this, YouTube how to drink whiskey like a sir, and you'll go down an interesting little journey.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:19]** I did.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** No, I did not do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:22]** But do it after you're done listening to this.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** Yeah, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:27]** We are more important than how to drink whiskey like a sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** Yeah, always.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** Teeling is good.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:35]** I think teeling and red breast for me are like the two Irish whiskeys that I dig.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** I agree.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** It's quite good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:42]** That bottle you gifted to me, John, went very far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:42]** Awesome.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:47]** And now I kind of want to get some tea legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:51]** I can't remember the scouts we had.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:54]** It's made by the guy from Highlander.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:56]** Dr. McLeod?

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:56]** Sean Connery?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:04]** Meryl Streep.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** Meryl Streep was last Highlander.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:11]** Her entry role into the industry was in Highlander.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:11]** Dude, yeah.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** That was her best acting role ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** There is a new Highlander coming out.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** With Meryl Streep.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** Oh, man.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:21]** Meryl Streep is the Highlander.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Whoever the protagonist is.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** No, it's with Henry Cavill.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:24]** Oh.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:25]** Oh, that sounds about right.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** That's awesome.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** Even though I haven't seen it.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:27]** Right?

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** It's going to be good.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** It's going to be good.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** Mr. Cavill.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Mr. Cavill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:34]** Mr. Cavill.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Well, I guess we ran out of banter.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** I think we did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:41]** Congratulations, Finder, you won.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:50]** It was stuck by a German warship or German submarine during World War I.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** So I'm not sure what the conspiracies are.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** That's what they want you to believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:55]** That's what they want you to believe.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** It wasn't an iceberg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** It was a torpedo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:00]** That was what started the war, basically, right?

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** That's the conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:06]** Yeah, that was purposely done to try to drag the U.S.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** into it.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** Stranger things have happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:12]** Don't poke the bear, foreign countries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:38]** well speaking of the ocean and the beach you all had a little bit of a uh a little bit of like a beach day i would say off right because it's like a last episode somewhere yeah well yeah i mean you had something kind of cool last time i think you you kind of had a minute where you were looking around and saying well we need to make some moves here but in order to do that we should just just play a game

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:42]** Let's just sit down and, you know, chill.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** Drink some tealing.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:47]** Starfinder version of Red Breast.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** It's Sazanac.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** Sazanac.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:54]** That's the scotch that I couldn't remember.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** Got it.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:55]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** It's really good.

**[00:12:56 - 00:13:01]** So don't forget that right before this, you all had determined a couple things.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:15]** You'd found the schematics of Tyrkala's base, as well as the map of the Varos landscape between Tyrkala's base and Terrapin Station.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:17]** Which, by the way, I did look it up.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** I did confirm.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:26]** The universal symbol for emergency meetup point is four arrows pointing inward from diagonal directions.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** And that's what I put on the map.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** And then Kelly made fun of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:32]** It still looks weird, man.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** No one knows that, though.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** So how is it good?

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:38]** How is it good for the world if no one in the world knows it's a thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:44]** I was less concerned about that and more that it's a comm station and possibly a prison.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:48]** Who cares about the emergency gathering point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** I care.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** For my lore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:58]** That somehow the lore... If there's one thing that came from Earth... Listen, he just is harping on this fact that it's not a prison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:01]** where we are right now.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** It's an emergency meeting point.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** This is a prison.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:09]** You all have discovered this with the aid of Keniko.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:15]** Keniko Breeze, the second in command of the Pykes Peritons, the mercenaries.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** And along the way, Dr.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** O.K.,

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:23]** Goes back to the rooms.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:23]** Yeah.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Does a little looking around.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:35]** You determine that your and Colin's room has been bugged with a microphone and a camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** But you can trust them.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:44]** Now, as part of this, you said, all right, well, we have a party tomorrow and a plan starts to form.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:48]** Kaniko is going to go off, do some...

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:56]** You all are going to go do some research with the discovery of this bugged monitoring devices.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:08]** You said, well, let's use these to our advantage because during the time of the pledge day party for Inspector Jock's herd, the most senior in command on Tikal's base.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:33]** you're like you know what we want it to look like we're going to be just playing a game because really we're going to go either research or execute part of the plant that's tbd just a minute so what do you do you play some bust out settlers of akaton sit down you play you have a good time kind of a nice moment in the middle of this crazy storm

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:35]** You receive a text.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Yeah, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:36]** What was that?

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** It's terraforming, Akaton.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** No, settlers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:41]** Terraforming, Akaton.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:41]** Apologies.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** Apologies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** Settlers of Akaton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:44 - 00:16:07]** uh during this time you receive a text which colin thinks is to him and him alone but it's not and then from kaniko saying that there's an update on the hangar because your idea previously has been talking about hey we should just get in the ship because there are two ships there there's the voycrier which is the stewardship now there's also the pikes peritons which is their own ship

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:09]** And you're like, hey, maybe we just hop on the ship and get out of here.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:13]** And Kaniko's like, just so you know, you can't access the hangar doors.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** You can't roll them up.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** You can't get them open.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:22]** Except for a control override from the command center, which is in the restricted area.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** She's like, let's talk about this over dinner.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:26]** So y'all are like, all right, cool.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:28]** Let's go to dinner.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** I forget who won the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:38]** Probably Dr. I remember it wasn't Kevin because Kevin was like, I meant to lose.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** He said that.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:39]** Remember?

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** And then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** I do.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:41]** Yep.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** Yep.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:42]** I remember that.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** He said, I lose every game I play.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:45]** Pull on it.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** I did say that?

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** That sounds like I'm Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:50]** Yeah, you were like, I lose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:52]** You were like, I knew I was going to lose.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** It's fine.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** I meant to lose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** I definitely, I definitely remember that.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** For sure.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:02]** It was probably Colin because he, sorry, he was just topped off with so much confidence from Kaneko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** He had all that Riz.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** All that Riz, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** Riz threw that game.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** Y'all go to the galley.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Sit down and get some grub.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** Pike's baritones are there.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** You all sit down near Kanika.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:20]** It's crowded, right?

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:22]** When the door opens.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** Oh, that's right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** The door opened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:28]** And who did the door open?

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** Inspector Jock's hurt.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** Standing at the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:38]** Is that his name or did you come up with that?

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** Do you really want to know that?

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:41]** I guess it doesn't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:42]** It's a positive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** That's a great question for plot hour.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** I just gave you the answer to that.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:47]** What was the name again?

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** Jocks what?

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:49]** Jocks.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:52]** J-O-X-H-I-R-D.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** Inspector.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** Unlike the Vlaka.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** Who's deaf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:00]** He is a Vrthani, which is not a Sarkeesian, to be clear.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** Vrthanis are not Sarkeesians.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:05]** And so he's very tall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:07]** If you follow us on our Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** They look very similar.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** Some say that they do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** Some say.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:19]** some report some say those pointy ears are a dead giveaway but what do i know you know yeah what do we know what do we know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:26]** As the door opens and everyone begins to realize who's at the door, the conversation kind of stops.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:30]** And the only sound is the beeping.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:33]** Kev, I see you trying to push that joke the second time you've done it.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:39]** Maybe if you do it a third time, it'll be good.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** Yeah, it's good.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** I was entertained both times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** I just would like that on the record.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:52]** What you all hear collectively is the beep, beep, beep, beep of the culinary synthesizer.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:55]** That's the only thing in the room.

**[00:18:56 - 00:19:05]** And you feel the vibration as this tall Vrathani ducks under the door and steps over the threshold because they're in their power armor.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** There's like a resounding vibration.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** How tall is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** Yeah.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:14]** How tall is said heard and how high are the ceilings?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:15]** The ceiling.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:17]** It's a really good question.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:21]** The ceilings here are pretty, I'd say probably 10 feet.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:22]** Okay.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** And he's just over seven feet.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:25]** Not that tall.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:28]** And in the power armor, he's another two and a half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:32]** Not enough to change his, you know, he's still a medium creature.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:39]** But he does try to step in, and Sparkles moves around the corner.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:43]** And I'm hoping, Rick, that you're going to move or else he's going to step on you.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:43]** He's going to step on me.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:45]** He's going to step on you.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** I've unpaused the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** I'm going to step on you.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** Benny.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** Where am I supposed to move to?

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** The colonizer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:50 - 00:20:18]** um is like whatever sorry what's the term for that oh my god that's fucking colin's new nickname because like i feel like oh wait hold on i don't know but like i in my head canon i want him to like i want that because like vis-a-vis kaniko i feel okay never mind this is not gonna be it's gonna be really dirty and weird and we should probably should not mention it

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** But I want you... I'm sorry, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:23]** I didn't mean to... I want you to colonize Kaniko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:31]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** It just does it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:36]** I feel like that was years.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** I feel like we just lost Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:43]** We just lost Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** Benny, what was your real question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:48]** Is this like out of the ordinary?

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:51]** Like, is this like pulling up to dinner with an AK strapped to your shoulder?

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** With the power armor?

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** Yeah, with the power armor.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:58]** He walked out with a power armor when he met you all yesterday.

**[00:20:59 - 00:20:59]** Gotcha.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:01]** So he just like, this is his security blanket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:02]** Yo.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Yeah.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** You know that shit stinks.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:04]** Right.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** Except for his.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:08]** There's a light smell of roses.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:11]** He drinks his own pee, but it's filtered, so it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:35]** it's it's got the incense the same the same incense still suit is working functionally and it's dressed in desert fashion let me put that in the case like he tastes like roses or something yeah herds armor smells like roses as he steps in they smell like it's back to doctors on a power armor uh that's the real lyric that andre crossed out uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** So he steps in.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:44]** The reaction of everybody else tells you that this is absolutely, like, it's also unusual for him to be here.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** Okay.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:47]** To, like, come in.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** Like, he's the head of the station.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** And he comes down.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:52]** And there's just a sign.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** Those commoners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** with you, please.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:58]** Kelly's still laughing at his third thought joke there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** I actually saw it.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:00]** No, no, no.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** I'm not laughing at colonizing.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:06]** I got to see the... What's the new species that we joked looks like Kevin on Discord?

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** Everyone thought it did or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:10]** That's what that two inspector talks heard.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:12]** I just logged into his face.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:15]** I just realized he looks kind of silly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** That's all.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** It's pretty good.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** Yeah, very close.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** I'm impressed.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:22]** Carpal Tunnel hasn't prevented you from doing that.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:25]** Yeah, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** I can't fucking do that.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** I could probably do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** I'd probably pay for it later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** Yeah, yeah, 100%.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** Alright, so he steps in.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:41]** And in his voice, he just goes...

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** I'm disappointed.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:51]** Disappointed that I have to come here myself to correct issues.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:57]** Today, the restricted wing was breached.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:02]** Not only once, but twice.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:07]** I will remind everyone here once more.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:15]** No one is to be in the restricted wing unless otherwise authorized to do so.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** He just looks around for a second.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:22]** Making sure that sinks in.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** He's talking about us, right?

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** I'm trying to count the two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** Did we even go there?

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** We barely went there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:39]** I think he's counting Rick walking back and he's counting Kelly going here's going to the radiation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** No, but we were invited in there by Koneko.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:44]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** Does this sound like the end of his address?

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** Or does he have more?

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** It's not the end.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** He pauses for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** Make sure that syncs in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:56]** Is this a three minute monologue?

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** Are we going to have to fight this guy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:05]** On a lighter note, you are all invited to an event tomorrow starting at 1700 for my pledge day.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** It will be located in the hangar.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:09]** Have a good night.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** Colin raises his hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:17]** Yes, Colin.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** A quick question.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:29]** How exactly would we get to be authorized to maybe gain access to this secure wing?

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:33]** You said not to go back there unless we were authorized.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** So how would we maybe do that?

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** You'll know if you're authorized.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** Can we ask for authorization from you?

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:47]** So is that like a pretty please or what's that process?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:49]** You guys know that's just going to antagonize them, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:58]** Rick is going to lean over to Colin and be like, I believe you have to be a steward in order to go into the restricted area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:02]** Well, our bad.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:06]** We didn't realize that we had to be stewards because we're kind of stupid.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:12]** So we just didn't know.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:17]** They wanted to take our brains and then we were like, no, you don't want to trust us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:21]** If you have questions, you can ask those under me.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Good night.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:27]** Walks out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** What a hard ass this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:32]** It's worth a shot, eh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:34]** I don't want to go to a celebration.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:34]** F*** that guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:37]** Rick gets off of the food thingy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:47]** Yeah, Rick is standing on the corner and says it all the time.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:47]** F*** you, dude.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** So...

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:52]** Everyone is like, what the f***?

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** Folks start talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:59]** Sorry, just to clarify, who in this room, everybody's just peritons and us, right?

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:02]** There's nobody that's, no stewards are in this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:02]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** So he's talking to all of us too.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:06]** He's talking to everybody.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:08]** But you get the sense.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:17]** You feel the heat on the back of your neck a little bit when he's like, not only once, but twice.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** You can put two and two together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:26]** The only time we went there, though, was because somebody else wasn't following us.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:33]** So I'd say to that, hmm, seems sus to me, but okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:36]** It maybe begs the question of what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** Sounds like he's inviting us to go back there.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:40 - 00:27:03]** this is how we were we're like oh he must want us to go back there for sure that's don't go behind the curtain oh let's go by the curtain oh wait don't don't don't go in the restricted area that means go in the restricted you see these flashing red lights at this door don't don't do it you clearly saw him winking when he said that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:27]** caught no one's authorized when we're when we're eventually caught by this dude i'm just gonna be like well i thought you were joking authorized your tone communicated to me excuse me you you didn't say on god and so yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:49]** no cap and uh so that was just you didn't say no cap so i thought i thought that it was cap right yeah we're gonna be busting to uh the restricted zone and then and then we're gonna like do some on god and god for real for real for real i don't know i don't know how many

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:21]** Um, Colin's a bit, you're not my real dad about this.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:30]** Like, cause he's already kind of skeeved by this whole setup and, and doesn't trust that these are stewards.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** And if they are stewards that they have their best interests in mind.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:35]** So like, okay, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** Keniko walks over to you, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** Colin, what do you, what do you make of that?

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** What's that?

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** I mean, he's not my real dad.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:49]** Why would he stop me from... She touches his elbow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:53]** She doesn't touch his elbow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:55]** Colin feels her touch his elbow.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** Yeah.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:58]** Whether she did or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:02]** We all want it.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:05]** Vote in our Discord whether or not you ship.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:14]** Is Colin the Rizzler of whatever station this is?

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Colin, you can be real with me.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:20]** Was that the four of you?

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:24]** I don't know if it was all four of us, but it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** I think he totally cut us in 4K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:32]** I mean, it was at least one of us.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:34]** All right.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:36 - 00:30:01]** look um and she tries to get rick like she's trying to talk about it within like a safe space where there are other paratons so like you know that there are people around and it's not sus like dipping into a briefing room or talking out loud in front of a yeah one of the stewards guards all right so she's like addressing rick and colin and here's and dr okay here's there's a there's an open seat over here if you want to you want to sit in the corner with us


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** Do you have something to talk about there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** Where is your token, by the way?

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** Oh, it's underneath Sarzel.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:11]** That's what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:16]** Hey, Colin, I'm going to sit down next to you, all right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** All right.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** That's fine.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:22]** You sit next to Kaniko, and I'll be right here.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:25]** All right.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:25]** Hi there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** So you all sit down.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** You two sit next to each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:38]** The configuration of seating is only important because of this proposed relationship between Kaniko and Colin.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:40]** Kaniko, Colin is like a very good meditator.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:44]** He is able to draw upon the mystic energies of the universe in a way.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** That's great.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:49]** Also, he won this game we were playing earlier.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** Just heads up.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:51]** I forget what it's called.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** I like games.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:55]** Colonizing Akaton.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:57]** Wow, that's what a name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** We're calling him the colonizer now.

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** That's his nickname.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:02]** Okay.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** Do you want me to call you that, Colin?

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:06]** Yeah, you should call him that.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** Call me whatever you want.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Please do.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** Okay.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** All right.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:11]** Cool.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** Cool.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:16]** Look, you all got my text about the hangar doors.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** Yeah.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** No.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** What text?

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** I didn't get a text.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:48]** fuck oh rick i'm just realizing that i don't that i didn't give you my number here he's responded with new phone who it is here's you just gave me your number i don't believe that you got a new phone look so i went and and checked it out about like in the hangar itself and yeah i mean i i

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:53]** I have to tell you that the doors are massive.

**[00:31:53 - 00:32:02]** There are the remains of a control operating mechanism to open the doors in there, but it's been taken out.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:07]** So I think the only way is going to be to go to a command center.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:21]** Um, look, we, it seems like from earlier, our plan has been that we've two windows of time to see what's, what else is back there and to figure out how we can get on the ship.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** One is obviously tonight.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:27]** Um, and the other is during the party itself.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:32]** Um, so the party's going to be in the hangar, um,

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:41]** So, I think that would provide a lot of room for people to be moving in the restricted wing, whether you're authorized or not.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:42]** What are we thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:44]** The f***ing clock isn't going to come into play.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Sorry, which clock?

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** That was Kevin talking.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:51]** The f***ing clock in the bottom of the screen is going to finally come into play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:54]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:56]** The sun movement thing.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:21]** so what are the options are you saying that the hangar doors where your ship is stored are locked shut except for from the control right so the only way to get them open i think it's going to be from whatever command center they have because we can't open them from inside the hangar itself is this something you just never noticed before how many times have you been stationed at this base

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:25]** I'm not usually the one opening the hangar doors when we leave.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:30]** We're usually coordinating and authorizing to leave or arrive at a certain time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Orvier's not in the room, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:33]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:36]** Where is Orvier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:39]** I believe Orvier's probably in his room.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** Maybe in the restricted wing.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:42]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** He shouldn't be in the restricted wing.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** We were just warned not to be back there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:49]** He's one of the only people who can go back there.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** Who's not a steward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:51]** Sus.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** Fishy!

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:55]** Can you go... What are the options again?

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** You said there were two options.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:59]** Well, not so much options, but here's the thing.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:04]** We're trying to determine when is a good window for us to get out.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:08]** And we have two options to either figure out information or get out.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:17]** And it seems like it's either tonight or it's tomorrow during the party itself, in which my understanding is that it will start in the hangar.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** I don't know how long that's going to go.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** Sometimes they like to party.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:25]** So I'm guessing they're going to have maybe like an after party back in their restricted wing.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:38]** So I don't know what the best route is, but I'm thinking that there needs to be like some sort of either like a diversion or you're able to open the hangar doors and hold it and override.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:40]** And then we can jump in.


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:46]** There's some information to be found out about where that is, what else is in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:52]** We do know that there is a vehicle bay for ground vehicles.

**[00:34:52 - 00:35:02]** If those doors open, I don't want to suggest that we steal a vehicle, but possibly we commandeer and borrow it and return it when we're coming back.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** Rick, you're very noble.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:07]** The definition of stealing is that you intend to return.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:10]** You're very good-hearted, yeah.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:16]** At this point, I think it's okay if we maybe let the loan on the vehicles lapse, right?

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:18]** Like, we don't really bring them back.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** That would be okay if we need it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:23]** We'll just leave them at the other steward's base.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** That way it's not theft.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:27]** We're using it to commute between bases.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Yeah.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** It's like a ride share.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:34]** I can get on more with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** We're not driving.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** We're just traveling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:42]** Yeah, we're just completely traveling and borrowing this and leaving it at an inconvenient location.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** That's all we're doing.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:45]** Well, it depends on what vehicles they have.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** Do we need to download an app for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:49]** Yeah, there is an app, I think.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:53]** Yeah, there is an app.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:59]** Look, it sounds like this might be something to check out tonight, if it's possible.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:06]** To know what vehicles are there, how to get in, and to know more about the command center?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:15]** You can bet they're going to be checking those monitors strictly for our whereabouts.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:25]** I'm sure if the commander just came into our mitts, then probably serious.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** No cap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:29]** We should definitely go to the command center first.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:31]** That's where they are monitoring the area from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** Yeah, I'm a fan.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** Yeah, fam.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** Listen, all right.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:41]** So, like, if we do that, there's going to be a night shift, of course, right?

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** There's going to be...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:42 - 00:37:08]** the night shift is lighter the shift change the night shift is lighter for sure like the doctor works late um but that's it i think they're you know like i've seen them before out pretty late so but i'm thinking that like we should decide okay what are what are our options to leave either we have these vehicles or we have the starship and then when it when when we know that

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:34]** like at the time like are we going to have a diversion like how are we all going to get on the starship or do like do you take the vehicles we take the starship and then like we meet up like this is what i'm trying to help figure out or we need a diversion so maybe they all run from the hangar and then you like sneak out and then we join you but the doors are open like we got to figure this out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** Yeah, we do need to create a diversion somehow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:40]** Maybe you trigger sensors or something and then run?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:48]** What if we sabotage that gray thing that we found that you talked about here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** The quantum synthesizer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:57]** So I saw it and Shane told me a little bit about it.

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:08]** And we can maybe clone something over and over and over into it to the point where it becomes rather bothersome and weird and perhaps attention- Bursting from the power center.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:23]** Could we possibly use the colonizing- culinary- Could we fracture our soul and put it into a horcrux of souls?

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:23]** That's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** Dr. Oka, you speak of such fantastical things.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Incredible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** It's all part of my glow-up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:33]** The fantastical beasts he comes up with are amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:34]** Wild.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:37]** It's like you're casting a spell on me.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:37]** It's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** Oh, yes, it's happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** To Dr. Oka.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:46]** Uh... Holy...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:46 - 00:39:14]** all right fam look it sounds like there's some information to be had tonight and then tomorrow we make the move do we agree on that timeline outside of the game like is there enough time to get from point a to point b tonight like steal a car go check out the remote base come back before dawn and then maybe boost a ship to get out

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** That's a great question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** Why don't you take a look at it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** That's a very good question.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:21]** The GM notes, you have no f***ing idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:27]** Why don't you check out the Veros landscape match?

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** Colin, you are so smart.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:33]** Let him cook.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:35]** Sorry, I'm trying to find the journal button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** It's an open book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** So we have two time frames.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:41]** The one time frame is tonight, which is a party.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:43]** And then tomorrow is the pledge day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** Tomorrow's the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:46]** What's tonight then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:52]** The point is that you just have another night in which most people are asleep.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** It's night.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:56]** There's less people walking around.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** All that s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:59]** So, metagaming the f*** out of this.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:03]** Tonight, when everybody's sleeping, is our recon night.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:07]** And tomorrow, during the party, is our action.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** That's what the colonizer is saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:11]** We can do it in one night.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** I don't have the map in my journal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:17]** You should have the Varus landscape map, but I will show players again.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** Show players.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** Guess the number winner prize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** No, that was the adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** That was the beans thing, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:53]** so that i mean and you should have the void crier handout to me or no the um tier cal schematic uh that is not in my journal either okay i'm gonna show all players yeah so you can show it to us but it doesn't add it to our journal okay yeah let me um wait hold on let me do there it is configure ownership can i give you limited see it now let me give you limited let's see what that is yep there it is cool and i'll do the same thing for the tier cal schematic


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:55]** Yeah, I see the Tercal schematic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** Okay.

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:02]** So Tercal schematic, the second box from the bottom right.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** Yeah.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:06]** Where you see the two little triangles.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:07]** Yeah.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:12]** The second box up is the hanger for the ground vehicles.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** Got it.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** I don't remember what the bottom door was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:21]** I think the bottom door was the interview room, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:26]** No, that's where the little room with the single arrow pointing to it.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:30]** That was the doctor's office and the interview room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Gotcha.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:35]** So we would have to go through the restricted zone to get to the cars anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:40]** Or the warehouse.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:44]** The big box in the middle is a warehouse.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:48]** The largest square is the hangar with the two ships.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:57]** The second largest is the warehouse, and then across from that is the hangar with the ground hangar, whatever we're going to call that, the garage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** Garage.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:04]** So we're going to get all our ducks in a row, figure out our deets, and make this plan pop off, bet?


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:14]** Did you want to look at the Varus landscape map, Benny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:20]** I did look at the Varus landscape map, and it was, I think it's, what, 150, 200 miles?

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:22]** 200 miles.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:27]** And that, I mean, how fast can you travel across that surface?

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** Probably 50, 60 miles an hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** Depends on the vehicle that you have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** Right.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** And we don't know what the vehicles are.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:35]** Not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:46]** Well, we'll find that out in the... So wait, are we boosting these whips, or are we just, like, gonna recon tonight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:51]** Sorry, could you repeat that, fam, one more time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:51]** Yo, mute.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:55]** Are we boosting these rides, or what?

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** Tonight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:59]** Are we making it go... By boost, you mean borrow, correct?

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:17]** sure yeah borrow and then never give back borrow that kind of thing yeah um yeah that exactly exactly uh that sounds dank i mean that guy gave me the ick real bad so yeah he had zero drip for sure


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:19]** Why is Ohio gross?

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:22]** I want to know the etymology of that.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:25]** I'm down to just ghost this bitch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:28]** Quick slang etymology.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** Ohio isn't gross.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:35]** Ohio is mid in every way possible.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:36]** It's what?

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:36]** Mid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** It's mid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** It's average.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:42]** Mid means like it's... Well, it's like whatever.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** Right.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:43]** Yeah.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** It's like fine.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** Yeah.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** You know, it's okay.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:49]** Which... Yeah, but like it has a kind of negative connotation.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** Yeah.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** I know this much.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:53]** Right.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:56]** The TikTok that I saw was like there were three words.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:56]** The TikTok.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** It was...

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:25]** skibby ohio something and he was like explaining that like skibby is real bad ohio is like kind of bad skibby can be good though right skibity isn't necessarily good or bad it it magnifies the quality of whatever it's talking about okay so skibity ohio is like super bad super mid and then super super mid yeah and then the last one was like being flirty so like if you're just flirty so if you have skibity ohio riz then like riz yeah super mid riz yeah

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:31]** Yeah, like, it's what you say to somebody when they, like, bomb a one-liner.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:37]** Now, with that said... With that said... Which I've been saying for years.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:43]** Apologies to all those in Ohio, because we have 831 downloads over the last two years from Ohio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:50]** Well, that's why I want to know why Ohio is the state that got mid... Because it's mid-state, because it's in the middle of the country.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** Yeah.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** I was trying not to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** Cleveland?

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** I'll be that guy.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** I'll be that guy.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:02]** Ohio is ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:02]** I'll be honest.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:07]** That was just some of the most bland landscape when I drove through it.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** There's just nothing.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** For real, we can't lose any more states.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:11]** We already lost.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Hall of Fame is there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:16]** Yeah, well, we're just adding in a lot of states that we hate.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:42]** with that said we don't hate ohio okay we don't hate ohio i would love to come to ohio and see how mid it is when we do a show there okay that's it columbus is dope i guess yeah yeah then he says i guess all right look back to it what are you gonna do what is the plan no cap what's the plan all right gang i don't think we have a plan we're just gonna do it just going okay cool go


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:45]** Understood the assignment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:49]** This episode of... 30 minutes has passed.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:52]** What's the... What's that ranching show?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:53]** He moved the clock!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** Yellowstone.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:57]** That episode of Yellowstone?

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** I've seen it.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:04]** So he's like, how are we going to get all these bulls from this pasture to this other pasture that's like 18 miles down the way?

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:08]** And his ranch head is like, best we can come up with, sir?

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:12]** He's like, f*** it.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** Spoiler alert.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:20]** So is the plan then to do it all tonight?

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:22]** Like go through the restricted area?

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:24]** I don't want to find out and then bounce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:28]** No, I believe the plan is to get the recon.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:30]** That's what Colin mentioned.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** Well, that's what Colin mentioned.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** It seems like a good plan.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** Here is my worry.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:37]** We need to be in communication, which we can do.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:41]** But in case anything goes wrong, I'm just worried about the scope.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** Do they have your text message now?

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** Yes.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:43]** Thank you.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** Exactly.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:50]** And the scope of understanding what vehicles we have so we could borrow or ride share them.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** She looks at you, Rick.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** What if something goes wrong?

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** Right.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** Right.

**[00:46:55 - 00:47:10]** yeah not gonna lie it seems a bit out of pocket and also why so you're stealing the vehicle so we can meet up somewhere else right so my concern is that we were warned not to go into the restricted yeah i feel like your plan has us going in there twice


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:17]** Yeah, this op, he's over here just, like, spitting some holy ick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:18]** Yeah.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:23]** Do you, uh... I'll tell you this is so sweaty right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:35]** You all do remember that, again, Shay and Gnarla have kind of given you, like... Shay clearly was, like, able to, like, get you a pass, Rick, for having gone through.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:40]** And, like, yes, Inspector Hurd did come down and say, don't go in there.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:47]** But I'll say that the question is like, what else do you want to do with that?

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:49]** It's fine if you don't want to go in there, but what do you want to do?

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** We obviously have to go in there.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** We have to go in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** There's no other option.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:52]** Right.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** The question is whether we go in there tonight or tomorrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** I don't know.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** We got to go in tonight.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** We have to go in, in my opinion.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** And I'm happy to go with you.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** It's fine if we need to.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:02]** Of course you are, John, because you're the GM.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** Or fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Go yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** It's fine if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** I'm just offering to help.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:18]** I suggest that we scout, but on the first sign of anything, we are taking one of those vehicles, borrowing it, and getting to that other base.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:20]** Can you go, do you know a way around security?

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** I don't.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:28]** I mean, I can maybe take some of the fall because I'm a pexperiton.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:33]** So if I need to be the one and you all hide in a room, I can be like, oh, hey, it was me.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:35]** I was stumbling around trying to see what's going on.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:38]** And then you all stay in there so I can take that fall.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:40]** The thing is, I need to get my crew out.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:42]** The best way to get them out is going to be on the ship.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:45]** So I want you all to get out and I want my crew to get out.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:46]** Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** What is the rest of the crew doing during this conversation?

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** Is anyone listening in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:56]** I mean, you could roll a perception check, but they seem like they're just eating.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** You could also ask Kaniko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:01]** Oh, yeah, they're just... We all finally look up and the room is silent.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** They're all just staring at us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:09]** 21 for perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:14]** They seem like they're eating, and Kaniko notices you and says, they're down with whatever.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** They trust me, and I've made a promise to them to protect them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:22]** So this is a safe space to talk about.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:28]** Did we ever check this room for taps or microphones or anything of the sort?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:36]** I thought, uh, you, uh, not you, but who's the, didn't somebody say that this room was safe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:39]** I think somebody last time sent this from the safe, yeah.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:41]** I couldn't remember.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:43]** For plot reasons, it probably should be.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:48]** I would literally be dead if that... Nearly everyone else is trying to get out, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** If we just, like, totally gave our plan, right?

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:51]** Right, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:57]** It's almost like we articulated the entire plan in front of one of the enemy troops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:08]** It's like we're... It's so... I mean, I get it, but it's like any friendly NPC, you guys are like... Whose fault is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** Whose fault is that?

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** It's not our fault.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:13]** It's just a prudent thing to do.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** It's not my fault.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Cap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:21]** I feel like... Yeah, that's Cap for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** Are the friendly NPCs in the room with us?

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:27]** For this cringe, we apologize for the cringe, I swear.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:28]** All right, so anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:35]** All right, so, Kaniko, do you know the location of the individuals that guard this area?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:41]** There's always somebody standing at the door down the hall, usually Sylvania or Lilac, right?

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:44]** Or Brick, is there another name?

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:47]** Always talking about some f***ing conspiracies.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:57]** And then there's always somebody in, probably at the command center, and there's probably somebody out in general patrolling the restricted wing hallways.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** I see.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** Right.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:08]** And you would think that that, for instance, during the shift that you were there, that was the patra that Shay was talking to in the language that you weren't sure what they were talking about, right?

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:12]** So, like, that was that.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:29]** person was the patra was probably the monitor person standing around checking making sure that there's no one else there i i uh so i have a suggestion yeah i i am uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:55]** i i can be invisible all right i was gonna like surprise you all later with like some cool visibility like at the top of the but i well actually wait i've already been invisible before never mind my memory's been all messed up because of all the things we've been through but because of that i can go through the hallways and kind of scout ahead and uh and you know do some things to kind of ensure that we uh can safely move through that area um so i can take the lead


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:55 - 00:52:13]** From my unwarranted time behind the restricted area, I believe that the warehouse section between the hangar and that hallway is probably not as monitored as the rest of the facility since that warehouse seemed to be dusty at best.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:24]** So my suggestion is to enter that warehouse from the hangar and then cross that door into or across the hall as fast as possible into the garage section.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** Yeah, stay low-key and move smart, fam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:29]** Quick question.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:34]** How did we get the doors open?

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:38]** Do we need credentials or biometrics?

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** How did those work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:52]** you will remember that, uh, when you've seen Silverton walking through, you have seen that Silverton is using a biometric like card, like, like lock.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:59]** Um, so that doesn't mean that you can't override it or cut off his hand.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:04]** Well, I mean like, you know, that is one way if you want to do it.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:04]** Okay.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:04]** Right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:11]** Won't steal a car, but will disembody a teammate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** You're like, yeah, I'm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:16]** Please.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:17]** He's a rat.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** It'll grow back.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:18]** It's fine.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** He's so on brand today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:24]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:28]** I hate to say this about my brethren, but he kind of annoys me.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** So it's okay.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:32]** He kind of annoys me.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** Okay.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:36]** So what are you thinking?

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:41]** So let's take the path of, you know, like, let's go the smart route.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:42]** I'll be invisible.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Scout ahead.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:47]** I believe you, Rick, about the dust and whatever, but just to be safe.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** Okay.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** And yeah, there you go.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** How does that sound to you all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:57]** Do you want to share quickly the invisibility?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:04]** That's the second thing I was going to say because I'm now committed to the rules for those that don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:07]** So I have a level 42 invisibility.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:10]** And you're level 5, right Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:36]** kelly you were fifth level yeah yeah yeah okay yeah so i mean invisibility is a second level spell yeah so uh full disclosure i didn't read this all the way so then like there it is so here we go there it is but i'm gonna do that now okay so here we go it's a second level spell i didn't cheat and this is the description the creature object touched becomes invisible see page 264

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:40]** If the target is a creature, any gear it is carrying vanishes as well.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:45]** If you cast a spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the target unless you can normally see invisible.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** So this can actually be anyone that does this.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:49]** The spell ends, the target attacks any creature.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:55]** For the purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell or harmful effect targeting a foe or whose area of effect includes a foe.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:58]** Actions directed at unattended objects don't break the spell.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:04]** Spells that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:06]** Causing harm indirectly is not an attack.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:15]** Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon security forces and have them attack, start a trash compactor with foes inside, remotely trigger traps and so forth.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** So it's quite robust.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** I like it a lot.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** And it's five minutes per level.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** So it's five or sorry, it's one minute per level.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** So it's five minutes for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:27]** It's five minutes, and Dr. O.K.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:31]** has the... Now, the circlet that you have, like Dr. O.K.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:33]** The circlet that you have, Dr.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:37]** O.K., can you talk to us one way or something?

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:45]** I don't... Or can only someone who knows telepathy use it, or you know what I mean, right?

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:46]** Or hear it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:51]** I think I can transmit my thoughts, but I don't think I can communicate...

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:56]** to weigh without them having the ability to communicate back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:56 - 00:56:05]** Well, that's okay because, unfortunately, because of my clipped antenna, which Silverton was very unhelpful in resolving, I can't.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** It's like a crapshoot.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:09]** I can accidentally speak out loud.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:14]** So I think whoever has that circlet should be going for it if that's you or someone else.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:16]** That's my proposition anyway.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:19]** Invisible circlet wielder goes forth.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:20]** There you go.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** That's my plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:26]** Who's got the... I don't have the sheet on it.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** I don't think I ever got it.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:30]** You should be able to add it in your hero lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:30]** What is it now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:37]** The, uh, circlet of, um, I don't know what it's called.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:37]** Yeah.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:41]** I had to add like, um, custom magical item.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:42]** Uh,

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:47]** Well, the good thing about Foundry is that you can go to the compendium.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** Mindlink circlet.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** Yeah, the Mindlink circlet.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:59]** If you click on the compendium packs and go down to equipment, then you should be able to search Mindlink and Mindlink circuit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** What mark is it?

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:03]** Mark 1 is 30 feet and Mark 2 is 100 feet.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** I know people don't trust me, so I'm going to send you the link.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:08]** I think it was Mark 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** Mark 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:32]** if that's the case then that's pretty good because yeah it will be good all right put it in the chat hey for the stealth stuff just so you guys are aware um i believe it says you have to deal with unseen creatures and you get a plus 40 if you're standing still to stealth checks but that's reduced to a plus 20 if you're moving so yeah we can go to that good old too

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:34]** Sorry, Emperor's New Groove.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:40]** Here is the stealthiest among us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:47]** Well, the invisible person doesn't need to beat super stealth, I feel, but that will be helpful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:55]** Well, in case when this plan inevitably fails... It's the best plan we have, I feel, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** I think both of those can be true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:00]** The circlet was the best plan.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:02]** That was a really decent plan, y'all.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** It's a good plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** It is inevitably going to hell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:07]** Well, it's only going to go to hell because Jon's going to be unfair.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:07]** That's why.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:12]** Are you guys thinking of the circlet from Mind Link's circlet?

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** Yeah, wasn't that in Junkers?

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:15]** No.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:16]** Well, I don't know.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** All I know is Will has one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** I thought I had one.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:25]** Yeah, I thought you did, too, but truthfully, I'm looking back in the previous books, and I don't see one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:30]** No, I thought I... Didn't we get it on the station?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:31]** No.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:32]** You know?

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:33]** Yeah.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:35]** I thought Colin can do mind link.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:35]** Yeah.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:36]** Yeah.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** Colin can do mind link.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** Mind link only appears three times in the mind notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** Okay.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** If that's the case, then Colin should go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:47]** Yeah, but that's not like the mind link circulate is different from mind link.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** The mind link circulate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:51]** Mind link is the whole like brain dump information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:53]** Well, okay.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** But can you communicate to us with your mind link ability?

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:58]** Cause that's what I can do as a Sharon.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:58]** You can't do that.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:01]** Oh, I got the mind link circle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:08]** It gives you the ability to talk mindlessly, like, like a Sharon, but non-verbally like a Sharon.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:16]** Um, mind link is just the, the ability for me to transmit to someone else feelings and experiences without using any words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** I forgot that.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** You did that on me before.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** So I have a plus nine stuff.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:21]** Whatever.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:25]** Well, Kevin, it sounds... I mean, Rick, it sounds like you're the man for the job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:29]** Kaniko has a... Oh, Kaniko's going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:29]** Great.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:34]** We should not trust... Well, I guess we probably realistically could, but I still don't think it's prudent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** It's up to you all.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** It's totally up to you all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:40]** I don't recall...

**[00:59:40 - 01:00:05]** win we got it so i don't i don't want to cheat and i don't want people to go back and be like you guys never had that that was a joke yeah i i remember in junkers giving you guys something like that i think it was in in junkers delight i'm not sure if you're confusing that with threefold i thought we had one though kimiko has um plus 15 to stuff kimiko's going i will go with kimiko


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:08]** I mean, I have this... I mean, I can only turn one person invisible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:16]** I have this thing in my inventory that's a custom magical item, but I don't... Because I couldn't add it before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** Yeah, I definitely believe you.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** Right.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** I don't remember.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:21]** And there's not, like, a date stamp.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:23]** Yeah.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:28]** I just didn't find anything when I'm searching circlet or mind link in the previous books.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** It's all right.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** We'll lose some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:32]** I don't know how to spell circlet, so I couldn't find that in my notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:36]** It's a circle with a T. C-I-R-C-L-E-T.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** Yeah.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** The other thing is this.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:47]** Keep in mind that if you want Kineko to go or whoever has the highest stealth, so invisibility gives you an insane bonus to stealth.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:49]** So it could be that you could just make... It's only five minutes, right?

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:52]** Well, it's five minutes, but if... That's enough time, I feel.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:54]** But Kelly can catch it twice.

**[01:00:55 - 01:01:02]** Kelly can catch it twice, and the range is touch, but if you wanted to make your way back at the last second, you could probably do that.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:07]** Keep in mind that somebody with the lower stealth...

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:35]** could maybe be invisible if you want two people and then you have the higher stealth person go with because they're more likely to succeed at checks right i'm just trying to help like uh to help give you guys i don't know if we need two people to like scout uh he's like one of y'all are gonna die if you go alone and right if two of you contends to like go stand watch on an open door like if something's gonna go down he's gonna you stand a chance


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:35]** Right.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:38]** There's also, like, comms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:41]** Yeah.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:45]** If it's all clear, like, I think people are kind of maybe overthinking it.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:47]** If it's all clear, comm is a great idea.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:49]** You just comm back because you know no one's there.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:52]** It's not like you have to perform the entire mission like stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:57]** Yeah, and keep in mind, Kaniko has said that there's one person standing outside, not even in the restricted wing.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:03]** That's the hallway where the doctor's quarters and the medical office and the reactor room door is, right?

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:05]** Like, they can't even see into that.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:10]** There's probably somebody in the command center, but maybe not.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:10]** You don't know.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:16]** And then there's only probably one other person who might be walking around.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:18]** And, like...

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:20]** You don't know where they're going to be walking.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** Right.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:23]** So it's like there's only one person.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:26]** And from the map, you can see that this place isn't too big.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:35]** So it's like it is possible within five minutes to probably time it and spend a minute to get into someplace, see what you need, go someplace else if you want to and come back.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:38]** just trying to paint it as like it's doable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:42]** Well, I have various tools for distracting people as well.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:42]** Don't forget.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:43]** I have Chad.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** I have like ghost sounds.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:46]** I can do some things to try to lure that individual away.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:47]** Yeah.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:49]** When we find out where they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:51]** Well, I mean, uh,

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]** More of an asinine comment.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:56]** Sorry.

**[01:02:56 - 01:03:04]** But it was going to be, John, as an acoustics engineer, how would you rate this hallway and corridor for noise?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:08]** They are...

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:33]** they're not government the stewards are not the government to be clear they're they're not but they are definitely uh you know this is a pretty austere place let's say like it's like dark stone on the outside like it's clearly a base that if they don't need it they're not going to spend on finishes in the uh hallways you know like everything that you've seen around you has been metal

**[01:03:33 - 01:04:00]** some sort of reflective surface uh is that mechanically going to hurt you when you're trying to sneak am i gonna be like oh you farted when you slipped and it echoed down the chamber no but like in a color way you know if you're trying to use ghost sounds like and you're using it at one end of the hallway maybe they would go all the way down the hallway and see what's going on yeah exactly fart noise around the corner yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:06]** Who stepped on that duck?

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:17]** I suggest that you and the Peritons provide us a tour of your ship this evening after dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:25]** That way we are all within the hangar and at that point someone can slip through the warehouse and...

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:28]** Sounds... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:29]** Wait.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:30]** You just want one person?

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** Wait, hold on.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:35]** You just want one person to go through the restricted area?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:41]** But the idea is that a couple of us are... We're all talking in the hangar.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:45]** And you recall also that there are no cameras that you've seen.

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:49]** But your whole point is there's an alibi.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:56]** So in case anybody down the hall like Sylvania or Lilac or whoever is like, where's everyone going?

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:58]** You're like, oh, they're just in the hangar.

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:00]** That might be more conspicuous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** We're just hanging out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:07]** That might be more conspicuous, but I see your point.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** I see your point there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:11]** All right, let's do it.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:12]** Move everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:14]** Okay, so who's going where?

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:15]** It's now 7.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:17]** It's like 545.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:20]** Let's hang in the hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** I'm game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:26]** Yeah.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:27]** Open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:34]** I'll go with, I guess, Koneko, you and I, and maybe someone else is going to the hallways, correct?

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:35]** The restricted zone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:39]** Rick leads the way into the hangar and Rick, you just start going, wait, sorry.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:39]** Sorry.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:41]** Say, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:42]** You're walking out.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:45]** She's like, wait, so we're all gonna.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:45]** Okay.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:47]** So who is going to sneak in?

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:48]** Go back in, Rick.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:52]** It's like, wait, so who is, who's going where?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:52]** Yeah.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:54]** Like I can't move myself.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:55]** I'm sorry.

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:56]** Cause you paused it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:56]** Sorry.

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:57]** All right.

**[01:05:57 - 01:06:18]** okay so okay so we're a few of us are going to give you a tour of the ship then who's going into the i think i think here's and keniko have to go here's because all he can cast invisibility keniko because she has some other tricks up my sleeves for you too so and keniko's allowed


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:19]** No.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:23]** Well, no, but she's slightly better than a bunch of randos, comparatively, I feel.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:26]** Plus, we're going to disguise her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:30]** Is it one creature per cast?

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:31]** Um...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:33]** Yeah, I can cast it twice.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:38]** You could cast it twice, and then you could have two people who are invisible.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:41]** That's actually also... Yeah, I could do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:47]** Yeah, I wasn't sure if you were going, like, two creatures, or if you were going one creature for ten minutes and another is high stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:51]** I think it might be good to have, like, two.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:52]** So, here's what I'm thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:56]** More people... She thinks she's the main character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:56]** ...equals...

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:00]** If we go into a room... Well, she's like a leader, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:05]** So she's like trying to provide... She is the main character in her own story.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:05]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:08]** There's someone else playing her.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:17]** My thought is more than one person able to... Like three people can get as much information as possible in a shorter time.

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:23]** The thing with more time means more potential of things, let's say, going wrong, right?

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:25]** That's my worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:25]** So three people.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:28]** That's fair.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:31]** The invisibility thing just needs to be for scouting.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:33]** That's true.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:38]** Yeah, so once we secure a route, we can be more confident about quickly doing it and getting out.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:41]** I can recast if needs be later for a scout on the way out.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:42]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:46]** Or cast in case somebody trips or something and needs to go.

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:46]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:50]** Okay, so she looks around at Dr. O.K.

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:50]** and Rick and Colin.

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:51]** Who wants to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:57]** I will take up the rear and provide support as needed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:58 - 01:07:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:59 - 01:07:59]** Excellent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:00]** So Dr. O.K.

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:01]** and the colonizer are staying here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:02]** Yeah.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:05]** We get this party lit in the hangar, yo.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:06]** Hell yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:07]** Okay, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:11]** Let's roll to the hangar so you all can slide to the restricted area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:14]** All right, so tours and sparkles.

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:16]** Maybe you want to give a tour.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:24]** I'll come along with and anybody else who isn't playing Terraforming Accuton tonight for tonight's game night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:32]** And if you want to come with, we're going to give a tour to some of the... Yeah, I'm really looking forward to this tour of your ship that we were already on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:35]** No, we haven't been on their ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:37]** Where is this ship?

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:39]** Their ship is on the other side of the hangar.

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:41]** It's the white wing that you can see.

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:50]** Rick pretends like he's looking at the void crier and just like admiring it.

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:54]** But I want to do perception of the hangar looking for cameras.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:56 - 01:08:57]** There are no cameras.

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:58]** Colin makes his way over.

**[01:08:58 - 01:08:59]** Hell yeah.

**[01:08:59 - 01:09:00]** That's good.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:03]** I find that very surprising.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:04]** Give me a sec.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:06]** I have to restart my foundry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:10]** I mean, that's the first place I would install a camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:12]** Right.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:13]** Because if somebody could steal something.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:14]** About right, yeah.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:16]** Well, these are fake.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:16]** Don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:21]** So Dr. K and Rick start walking over to... And Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:32]** And Colin start walking over to... Should we, like, hang by the door while they slide in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:34]** I want to see the rest of the hangar.

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:35]** How do I see the rest of the hangar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:37]** There's no rest of the hangar, is there?

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:37]** There's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:38]** There's not.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:47]** No, Rick is staying in the bottom right-hand corner toward the front starboard side of the void crier, because that's where the door to the warehouse is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:48]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:54]** I forgot to... I mean, I've never really seen it by the...

**[01:09:54 - 01:10:10]** you know this this thing i feel like it's easier to get lost in a crowd if somebody were watching uh but how long does it take to cast invisibility it takes uh yeah one step yeah there you go i'm just like what a shiny floor


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:14]** Do we need to get onto the ship to cast it in private, or...?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:16]** Well, there's no cameras.

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:19]** It all depends on whether... No, there's no cameras here, right?

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:20]** So it should be okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:23]** I would actually wait till we're in the warehouse, because I doubt there's cameras in the warehouse either.

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:26]** We can... Yeah, that's cool.

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:29]** Kaniko breaks into the warehouse, and then she gets caught, and we're like, Why, Kaniko?

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:30]** What are you doing?

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:32]** What the f*** are you doing in the warehouse, Kaniko?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:32 - 01:10:34]** She's got that BDE energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:37]** We just go like, bloop, bloop, and then like... She does have BDE energy.

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:40]** Did you say she's B-Energy?

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:41]** No, she's B-D-E.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:43]** Big Dick Energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:46]** Oh, they were saying B-E, like breaking energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:47 - 01:10:51]** So, as you're walking up... B-N-E was at B-D-E.

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:56]** So as you're walking up, I need somebody to give me an engineering or computers check.

**[01:10:57 - 01:11:00]** As you walk up to the double airlock doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:02]** I'm going to do a computer check.

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:03]** She doesn't have either of those.

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:04]** 19.

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:06]** That's not that high this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:09]** Colin has neither.

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:09]** Good luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:13]** I was rolling to assist, but I can do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:16]** You can stand alone and do it, yeah, I feel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:18]** I assist with engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:21]** I assist Dr. O'Kays, I feel.

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:22]** Because I feel like it's higher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:26]** So it's plus two, and Dr. O'Kay, what did you get?

**[01:11:26 - 01:11:30]** I mean, I rolled a 15 plus 13 for engineering, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:31]** Yeah.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:31]** 28.

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:33]** So 28.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:34]** I mean, it's an automatic assist.

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:35]** 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:36]** Yeah, okay.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:37]** Automatic assist.

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:38]** What do you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:42]** Are you assisting?

**[01:11:42 - 01:11:43]** Here's failed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:46]** I rolled a 19.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:48]** It's mid.

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:49]** It's Ohio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:54]** I'm just asking who's wrong and who's assisting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:57]** I'm assisting, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:57 - 01:12:00]** If you fail, I'll just re-roll it.

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:01]** It's not a failure.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:02]** I don't know.

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:02]** It's a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:06]** Was it 19 enough to open it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:07 - 01:12:07]** I don't know.

**[01:12:08 - 01:12:09]** Let's go with your roll.

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:11]** If that's okay with you, John.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:12]** Because I want to be rules conscious now.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:17]** Do we have to decide who the roller is?

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:18]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:19]** I'm asking you.

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:20]** Who is going to roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:26]** If we're going to respect the rules, which I like to do now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:27]** I think you already rolled.

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:29]** Yes, exactly.

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:30]** And I rolled to assist.

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:33]** Did Colin assist or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:34]** Collin doesn't have either of those checks.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:36]** Collin doesn't know.

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:37]** Did Rick assist?

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:38]** I assisted.

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:41]** So you have a 19 plus 4.

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:41]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:43]** Sorry.

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:43]** 23.

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:43]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:44]** Okay.

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:45]** So 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:54]** You go up to the biometric reader and it doesn't open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:57]** Looks like we have to kill Silverton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:58 - 01:12:58]** Alright, cool.

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:00]** Do you want to try it?

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:01]** Can we just re-roll?

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:04]** Do you want to take 10 or take 20?

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:05]** I mean, I would take 10.

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:07]** It's trapped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:09]** Let me take 10.

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:10]** It just opens.

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:13]** Stand aside.

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:14]** I think I've seen this thing before.

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:15]** Hold on.

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:17]** I rolled a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:21]** Well, were you rolling or were you taking 10?

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:23]** Because if you take 10, you just add your modifier.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:25]** But if you're trying again, you would roll.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:26]** He's trying again.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:27]** Yeah, I tried again, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:28]** You should take 20.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:31]** Take 10 is not great.

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:32]** You should take 20, I feel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:35]** We're not in a rush, in my opinion.

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:37]** I mean, you're pretty much taking 20.

**[01:13:37 - 01:13:37]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:41]** I literally just rolled a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:42]** No, but it's 20 plus your modifier.

**[01:13:43 - 01:13:43]** Oh, so you have 40.

**[01:13:44 - 01:13:47]** You have 40 then, if it's a take 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:47 - 01:13:49]** But you don't roll when you're taking 20.

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:50]** It's fine.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:50]** It's 20.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:51]** What's your modifier?

**[01:13:51 - 01:13:52]** What is your total, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:56]** My total for engineering is 33.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:56 - 01:13:58]** Engineering or computers.

**[01:13:58 - 01:13:59]** Okay.

**[01:13:59 - 01:14:00]** All right.

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:06]** You are able to detect two things.

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:08]** One, that...

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:14]** that the door will open with that.

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:29]** And you're, and you're also able to see that there's an alarm that's been triggered silently because of your first failure to open it, but nothing's happened in the time that you've gone through.

**[01:14:29 - 01:14:30]** Okay.

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:31]** We have to use the idiot excuse again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:33]** I don't know how many times you can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:34]** Uh, we're like fucked.

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:36]** So Dr. Okay.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:37]** Slaps.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:38]** Here's across the face.


## Speaker_0

**[01:14:39 - 01:14:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:39 - 01:14:41]** What the f***?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:42]** What the f*** did you just do to Hears?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:43 - 01:14:46]** What was that, like some 1800s challenge to Hears?

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:47]** What was that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:49]** Did you take your glove off before you did this?

**[01:14:49 - 01:14:50]** No, no.

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:57]** This is a distraction for the... Did you just bump that door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:57 - 01:14:58]** Why would you bump into that door?

**[01:14:58 - 01:14:59]** Yeah, why would you do this?

**[01:14:59 - 01:15:01]** It clearly says do not enter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:04]** He just gave us a bunch of... Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:04 - 01:15:04]** Alright, alright.

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:07]** I'm so sorry, Dr.

**[01:15:07 - 01:15:08]** O.K.,

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:11]** What a buffoon I was being by doing that.

**[01:15:12 - 01:15:13]** I didn't even mean to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:14]** We have to do this again.

**[01:15:14 - 01:15:15]** I'm just trying to explore.

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:17]** Actually, when they come to investigate the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:21]** I'm just waiting for John to say roll for initiative.

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:27]** Maybe you're waiting and nothing happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:29]** I don't trust this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:34]** The door has unlocked, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:35]** When you're in there.

**[01:15:38 - 01:15:40]** Just get your invisibility on.

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:43]** They're going to be looking for you.

**[01:15:44 - 01:15:47]** With this silent alarm I detected.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:47 - 01:15:48]** Fair enough.

**[01:15:48 - 01:15:50]** Let's move to the closest possible location.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:51]** Wait a second.

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:52]** Do we go to the warehouse?

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:53]** Wait a second.

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:54]** Wait a second.

**[01:15:54 - 01:16:02]** How about we go to the warehouse, create the diversion in there, get kicked out of the warehouse, which is less... I feel like we just adequately created a diversion, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:03]** You're at the warehouse.

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:04]** This is the door to the warehouse.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:06]** Yeah, this is the warehouse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:06]** Right.

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:08]** But is the warehouse restricted?

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:09]** Is that clear?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:11]** It's clearly a restricted area.

**[01:16:12 - 01:16:13]** Is it rubbed off, though?

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:16]** It just says restricted?

**[01:16:16 - 01:16:18]** It says restricted.

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:20]** It says restricted access.

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:22]** It said that from the beginning.


## Speaker_0

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:29]** Okay, well, if we open this door, then... If we're going to go, now is the time.

**[01:16:30 - 01:16:33]** It's going to be openable from the outside.

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:34]** Alright, fine.

**[01:16:34 - 01:16:38]** If there's no one in there, it's not going to... Is there spare parts in there?

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:39]** Are there spare parts?

**[01:16:39 - 01:16:42]** There's going to be an invisible person going through the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:16:42 - 01:17:06]** we'll find out are there spare parts yeah just let i mean because then we could just say hey we were looking at this ship and noticed that it needed uh a tutup so uh myself you know being an engineering expert who has the best diplomacy because they could just pretend like they bumped the door keniko does i think she's gonna go invisible because she has the highest stealth


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:08]** The whole point was... All right, Rick, get your ass over here.

**[01:17:09 - 01:17:10]** Get your beautiful ass over here.

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:11]** I have zero diplomacy.

**[01:17:11 - 01:17:12]** Can I open the door?

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:15]** No, we got to make Rick invisible.

**[01:17:15 - 01:17:16]** Just give me like one second.

**[01:17:16 - 01:17:19]** I thought that we were going to make Rick invisible in the... Okay, all right.

**[01:17:19 - 01:17:20]** All right, fine, fine.

**[01:17:20 - 01:17:21]** No, you're right, Keniko.

**[01:17:21 - 01:17:21]** I'm sorry.

**[01:17:21 - 01:17:22]** I slacked across the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:17:22 - 01:17:25]** Can't we look into the warehouse and see that there's nobody in there?

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:26]** No.

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:28]** Rick is getting... Because there's a window, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:31]** Rick is just going to push the door open and go.

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:32]** Okay.

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:33]** No, Kaniko.

**[01:17:33 - 01:17:34]** Kaniko, you do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:35 - 01:17:40]** As you walk into the warehouse, it's about 25 feet high.

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:46]** You're lined with metal racks and shelving.

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:50]** There are storage containers all along the walls and in the middle of the room.

**[01:17:51 - 01:17:54]** It's probably about a 30 by 50 foot room.

**[01:17:54 - 01:17:56]** It's huge with three big...

**[01:17:55 - 01:17:57]** storage containers in the middle of the room.

**[01:17:58 - 01:17:59]** And they're pretty high shelves.

**[01:17:59 - 01:18:11]** And then on the walls, it's filled with all different types of goods from food to facilities, items to ship parts to a lot of different things.

**[01:18:12 - 01:18:14]** Kaniko walks in behind you.

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:19]** She's got one hand kind of like at her gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:18:20 - 01:18:23]** I'm going to rummage through these closets while you guys go sneak about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:25]** I got a 12 for perception.

**[01:18:25 - 01:18:28]** Looking for cameras or sensors in this room.

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:31]** You don't see any cameras or sensors in this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:32]** It looks all clear.

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:34]** Nat 20 plus 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:36 - 01:18:36]** Do I see anything?

**[01:18:37 - 01:18:38]** You don't see anything either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:39 - 01:18:40]** So Dr. K is coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:18:40 - 01:18:43]** He's going to be in here now.

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:45]** I'm just popping in to steal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:46 - 01:18:47]** Yeah, that's all I'm doing.

**[01:18:47 - 01:18:48]** I'm just coming to steal shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:48 - 01:18:51]** Rick notices there's a door at the top right.

**[01:18:51 - 01:18:52]** I'm not going to try to open it.

**[01:18:53 - 01:18:54]** Does that door have a window on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:56 - 01:18:58]** No, neither door has a window.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:58 - 01:18:59]** Really?

**[01:18:59 - 01:19:05]** Okay, so Rick is going to then stand against these things and kind of watch the doors open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:12]** Give me a... Whoever is trained in engineering or computers, give me another check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:19:14 - 01:19:16]** Dr. K, you're in the room too, so you're walking around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:21]** I got a... I didn't do well.

**[01:19:21 - 01:19:22]** I got 10.

**[01:19:22 - 01:19:23]** 28 engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:23 - 01:19:25]** But that's a pass for... 28 engineering.

**[01:19:25 - 01:19:26]** Dr. K. Assist.

**[01:19:26 - 01:19:28]** You are... Okay, assist.

**[01:19:28 - 01:19:28]** That's fine.

**[01:19:29 - 01:19:30]** All of you think this.

**[01:19:30 - 01:19:31]** 32.

**[01:19:31 - 01:19:35]** The air... The double doors are like airlock doors.

**[01:19:35 - 01:19:39]** Like, they're f***ing, like, meant for to move things in and out of.

**[01:19:39 - 01:19:40]** They're really intense.

**[01:19:40 - 01:19:43]** The smaller door up in the top corner is just a steel door.

**[01:19:44 - 01:19:45]** And you think...

**[01:19:46 - 01:19:51]** That alarm probably won't be on the smaller door.

**[01:19:51 - 01:19:51]** Yeah.

**[01:19:52 - 01:19:52]** Okay.

**[01:19:52 - 01:19:55]** But it would probably be on the larger door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:19:56 - 01:19:57]** Yeah.

**[01:19:57 - 01:19:59]** So the alarm's going to be on that...

**[01:19:59 - 01:20:04]** big hunking piece of metal over there, not this little scrappy thing on the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:04 - 01:20:19]** If I might mention, looking at this schematic, it looks like the red dots are alarmed doors, maybe?

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:22]** Because that little door isn't on this map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:25]** Good catch, fam.

**[01:20:25 - 01:20:26]** Don't tell John that!

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:28]** Oh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:20:29 - 01:20:53]** wait i can't pull open the map that wouldn't that wouldn't make sense though because you see that there are other smaller doors on there okay yeah so that's just me missing a door i can i don't see the i don't see it uh at what point do i roll perception for any items that are worth grabbing from this room


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:54 - 01:20:55]** Because you want to steal.

**[01:20:55 - 01:20:56]** There's a lot here.

**[01:20:56 - 01:21:00]** So if you really want to steal something, you could take a lot of stuff if you want to.

**[01:21:01 - 01:21:04]** Is there some power armor on the corner?

**[01:21:04 - 01:21:07]** No, there's no weapons or armors in here.

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:09]** No, there's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:21:10 - 01:21:11]** Any cool magical items?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:11 - 01:21:12]** No.

**[01:21:14 - 01:21:34]** the it's full of stuff but nothing that's useful no one wants to steal that john you get some snacks doctor okay there is okay there are let's see let's see because this is the not essential part the western double door has cargo lifter powered armor which is a different thing so i take that back um

**[01:21:35 - 01:21:36]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:21:36 - 01:21:38]** This is why you ask questions, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:38 - 01:21:40]** This is why we do things.

**[01:21:40 - 01:21:45]** You'll need to search for 10 minutes and give me a perception check, Doctor.

**[01:21:45 - 01:21:46]** What was your perception earlier?

**[01:21:48 - 01:21:49]** I don't think that you did one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:21:49 - 01:21:51]** I didn't roll a perception earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:51 - 01:21:55]** I'm going to take 20 on my perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:21:55 - 01:21:57]** I got a 20 dirty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:59 - 01:22:00]** 20 dirty.

**[01:22:01 - 01:22:02]** Okay.

**[01:22:02 - 01:22:03]** I meant to say this earlier.

**[01:22:03 - 01:22:09]** Colin has a pretty decent diplomacy, so he's just kind of walking up to explain the situation to whoever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:11]** Everyone's in there now.

**[01:22:12 - 01:22:12]** Everyone's in there now.

**[01:22:12 - 01:22:14]** But I do like that Colin is on the comps.

**[01:22:15 - 01:22:16]** Okay, so you get a 20.

**[01:22:16 - 01:22:21]** You notice that there are... I'll say this.

**[01:22:24 - 01:22:28]** There are a lot of expensive food and luxury goods.

**[01:22:28 - 01:22:30]** Ooh, I got the munchies.

**[01:22:32 - 01:22:34]** Give me an intelligence or culture check, Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:22:34 - 01:22:36]** Oh, I love culture check.

**[01:22:36 - 01:22:36]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:22:38 - 01:22:41]** I'm going to bump the time up to around six right now.

**[01:22:41 - 01:22:42]** 25.

**[01:22:42 - 01:22:44]** 25.

**[01:22:45 - 01:22:47]** This is happening while they're breaking in, right?

**[01:22:48 - 01:22:51]** This is just happening as we're about to get what they're doing.

**[01:22:51 - 01:22:51]** All right.

**[01:22:51 - 01:22:52]** Get to what they're doing.

**[01:22:52 - 01:22:53]** Yeah, it seems odd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:22:53 - 01:22:56]** I don't want to start the clock on this, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:22:56 - 01:23:00]** No, but I'm just keeping time kind of loosely going in the background, right?

**[01:23:00 - 01:23:00]** Like you guys are doing things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:23:00 - 01:23:02]** I mean, we're starting this right after supper.

**[01:23:02 - 01:23:03]** Like nobody's asleep yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:23:04 - 01:23:06]** That is true.

**[01:23:06 - 01:23:07]** That is true.

**[01:23:08 - 01:23:10]** So it does seem odd.

**[01:23:11 - 01:23:14]** That this base has all this luxurious stuff.

**[01:23:14 - 01:23:17]** It's like, wow, that's pretty... It's a lot.

**[01:23:18 - 01:23:19]** That's a loose tray over there.

**[01:23:19 - 01:23:20]** It's kind of peculiar.

**[01:23:20 - 01:23:22]** I'll say this.

**[01:23:24 - 01:23:28]** What are Rick and Kaniko and Hears... Well, I know what Kaniko will do.

**[01:23:28 - 01:23:30]** What are Hears and Rick thinking about doing?

**[01:23:32 - 01:23:37]** It sounds like we might want to go through this top door up here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:23:37 - 01:23:38]** Agreed.

**[01:23:38 - 01:23:40]** Yeah, that would be my advice for y'all.

**[01:23:40 - 01:23:42]** My worry, though... This is a Dr. O'Keefe analysis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:23:43 - 01:23:43]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:23:44 - 01:23:45]** Can I see that schematic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:23:45 - 01:23:46]** Don't get cooked, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:23:46 - 01:23:47]** Yeah, I have a copy.

**[01:23:47 - 01:23:48]** Look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:23:48 - 01:23:49]** Okay.

**[01:23:49 - 01:23:52]** My worry is I remember that the command center has a lot of windows.

**[01:23:52 - 01:24:00]** And if based on where this door is, my worry is that opening the door might we might see.

**[01:24:00 - 01:24:02]** That is correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:24:02 - 01:24:08]** There are glass windows, but there is a computer console there that is kind of blocking the view of where we're sitting in that room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:24:08 - 01:24:09]** So it's a gamble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:09 - 01:24:12]** However, it is quite the gamble.

**[01:24:12 - 01:24:17]** We could alternatively disable the alarms on the double doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:24:18 - 01:24:24]** You do know that if you are able to roll high enough, you can do that on your first roll.

**[01:24:24 - 01:24:25]** What if we fail?

**[01:24:25 - 01:24:26]** Will it set off something?

**[01:24:27 - 01:24:28]** Yep, probably.

**[01:24:28 - 01:24:30]** If you're trying to hack in, that's the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:24:30 - 01:24:32]** It'll send a signal like we've already done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:24:32 - 01:24:34]** You've already set it off once.

**[01:24:35 - 01:24:36]** Yeah.

**[01:24:36 - 01:24:38]** They know we're in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:24:39 - 01:24:41]** There are no cameras in here, are there?

**[01:24:41 - 01:24:42]** None that you could see.

**[01:24:42 - 01:24:43]** They know that the alarm has gone off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:24:45 - 01:24:45]** Fair enough.

**[01:24:45 - 01:24:49]** We could cover our tracks and be like, this klutz.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:24:49 - 01:24:51]** John, what is this object right here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:51 - 01:24:53]** It looks like a turret or something.

**[01:24:53 - 01:24:53]** Power armor.

**[01:24:55 - 01:24:56]** Cargo lifter power armor.

**[01:24:57 - 01:24:58]** Let's keep that in mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:00 - 01:25:02]** Should we take power armor for a bit of a joyride?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:25:02 - 01:25:05]** Yeah, I think that sounds like a plan.

**[01:25:05 - 01:25:07]** I've always wanted to drive one of these things.

**[01:25:08 - 01:25:10]** You know I'm forklift certified, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:11 - 01:25:14]** This would be a good distraction time if you guys think of something you could pull their attention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:15 - 01:25:17]** How does this thing work again?

**[01:25:17 - 01:25:18]** I took a level in piloting.

**[01:25:19 - 01:25:20]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:25:21 - 01:25:22]** I mean, I've piloted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:25:22 - 01:25:23]** Are you not power armor qualified?

**[01:25:23 - 01:25:28]** I think you can still use power armor, but you're going to be penalized for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:25:29 - 01:25:30]** You want to give it a spin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:31 - 01:25:32]** I'd have to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:25:32 - 01:25:33]** I'll watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:33 - 01:25:38]** Oh, I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:25:38 - 01:25:39]** Kitten.

**[01:25:41 - 01:25:41]** Yes.

**[01:25:42 - 01:25:48]** For the audio listeners, John has a small kitten that is visiting him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:25:48 - 01:25:49]** She's kind of bigger.

**[01:25:50 - 01:25:52]** Kind of bigger now, but yeah.

**[01:25:52 - 01:25:52]** Wow.

**[01:25:53 - 01:25:53]** Okay, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:25:53 - 01:25:54]** She's a ball of fluff.

**[01:25:55 - 01:25:56]** Where do you want to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:25:56 - 01:25:59]** So, are you all... What are you trying to do right now?

**[01:25:59 - 01:26:01]** Are you trying to get the power armor?

**[01:26:01 - 01:26:03]** And which door are you going to try and open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:03 - 01:26:06]** Well, should we... Would a distraction get them out of the control room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:26:08 - 01:26:11]** Do you want to try to get them out of control?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:11 - 01:26:12]** I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:26:14 - 01:26:18]** I mean, wrecking this power armor would definitely cause a distraction, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:18 - 01:26:21]** I feel like we have a little bit more goodwill here.

**[01:26:21 - 01:26:26]** We can f*** up with the power armor more than we can just getting caught going in the restricted area.

**[01:26:26 - 01:26:28]** We'd just be a bunch of goons, you know?

**[01:26:29 - 01:26:30]** Rubes, anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:26:30 - 01:26:32]** I'm really bad at common.

**[01:26:33 - 01:26:35]** It's not my first language.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:35 - 01:26:37]** I feel like a distraction, personally... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:26:38 - 01:26:42]** I feel like a distraction would be... I don't believe distraction should be our first attempt...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:26:42 - 01:26:48]** As of right now, I feel like Colin and Dr. OK Fumble are around with Power Armor is a pretty good distraction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:26:50 - 01:26:51]** OK, right.

**[01:26:51 - 01:26:52]** It's not our plan.

**[01:26:52 - 01:26:53]** It's the backup plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:53 - 01:26:57]** Rick, the problem is, is if we open that door and they can see us coming out of the door.

**[01:26:57 - 01:27:01]** Alternatively, we could we could try to like hack the door here.

**[01:27:01 - 01:27:05]** And yeah, it's like it's a risk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:27:05 - 01:27:07]** I think you all should try to hack it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:07 - 01:27:10]** All right, Dr. Okay, I could really use your help with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:27:10 - 01:27:15]** I'll give you guys a plus two because you've seen what the alarm is.

**[01:27:15 - 01:27:19]** So you'll have a plus two automatically to your role because you've seen how it's configured.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:27:19 - 01:27:27]** And actually, I think... Nope, never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:27:27 - 01:27:43]** Okay, so to be clear for the listener, Dr. Okay and Colin are going to be working on the standing around the power armor slash looking around while Hears and Rick and Kaniko are going to be opening the airlock door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:43 - 01:27:44]** I thought Dr. O.K.

**[01:27:44 - 01:27:44]** was going to help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:27:44 - 01:27:45]** Dr. O.K.

**[01:27:45 - 01:27:46]** Come over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:27:46 - 01:27:49]** I can help with the hack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:27:50 - 01:27:52]** Rick does not plan to enter the hallway unless he needs to.

**[01:27:52 - 01:27:59]** And he's got his net fiber net and his guns ready in case he has to knock someone out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:59 - 01:27:59]** Dr.

**[01:27:59 - 01:28:01]** O.K., I'll try to keep it in character.

**[01:28:01 - 01:28:01]** Dr.

**[01:28:01 - 01:28:06]** O.K., I took 13 units in computers in university and 10 units in engineering.

**[01:28:07 - 01:28:07]** What do you have?

**[01:28:07 - 01:28:08]** How many did you take?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:28:08 - 01:28:13]** I took 12 in computers and 13 in engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:28:13 - 01:28:36]** well then it's it's a toss-up because i have 13 computers and you have 13 engineering then um what's gonna be you've had a lot of good luck so why don't you yeah i think my luck's running dry i think you should try and i'll assist and bernice will assist it's gonna be two roles one would be to disable the alarm and if you do then you would then roll again to open to unlock the door right

**[01:28:36 - 01:28:37]** All right.

**[01:28:37 - 01:28:40]** And you're going to get a plus two to disable.

**[01:28:41 - 01:28:44]** So we're sure that this door is not across from some windows, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:28:45 - 01:28:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:28:46 - 01:28:50]** It seems like it's you would remember that this door is across from the garage door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:28:51 - 01:29:17]** yes that is correct okay so we need to do two rolls so should we each do a roll so i'll do the engineering check to get rid of the um to unlock it okay how about this i already rolled for i already rolled and i think you should let me go with yes because it's a good roll wow yeah just be yeah so i got it next time kelly just just announce that you're gonna do it instead of just pre-roll my bad my bad yeah he did


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:29:18 - 01:29:46]** oh i did say i was i was gonna go first yeah so all right um so 28 plus the automatic two and then could could you assist me with this doctor yeah yes of course is anybody else assisting with uh this computer's uh like i'm pretty sure bernice i think bernice can help too uh can you you i'm i doubt you could use bernice at the same time that you can like you can't double dip


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:29:46 - 01:30:01]** you're gonna have bernice assist yeah i think bernice can you have bernice uses your abilities right so bernice can't assist as a separate thing we talked about this actually like two two episodes ago why does she have a computer score

**[01:30:01 - 01:30:08]** Because she can use it on her own, but I don't think that drones can... Like, if she was separated from you, she could do her own thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:30:08 - 01:30:09]** But, like, she's with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:30:09 - 01:30:13]** Right, but I can... I don't think you guys can both... But I can separate even close.

**[01:30:14 - 01:30:19]** Like, it's not like... I can just say, hey, Bernice, can you see if you can give... Here's a hand.

**[01:30:19 - 01:30:19]** That's an instruction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:30:20 - 01:30:27]** I'm fair... Yeah, I mean, she could do it through you, but, like, you can't both assist is my understanding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:30:28 - 01:30:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:30:28 - 01:30:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:30:29 - 01:30:33]** My understanding of the rules is that you're basically piloting her for that.

**[01:30:33 - 01:30:34]** She's not acting autonomously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:30:35 - 01:30:36]** At least for this.

**[01:30:36 - 01:30:43]** If I give her an instruction to assist, that's her acting independently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:30:43 - 01:30:45]** But I thought that that would be you assisting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:30:45 - 01:30:47]** We've gone down this road before.

**[01:30:47 - 01:30:53]** If I'm using remote through her with my goggles or whatever.

**[01:30:54 - 01:30:56]** Let's see what the rules say.

**[01:30:56 - 01:30:59]** I'm pretty sure that's one of the party pieces of having a drone.

**[01:31:00 - 01:31:05]** She would still have to roll for it because her computer isn't that high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:05 - 01:31:16]** One of the best things about Will in playing these things is he always has a familiar or some kind of drone or some other thing, no matter what game it is, and they always are insanely capable of so many things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:31:16 - 01:31:21]** Your drone can use this skill while not under your direct control.

**[01:31:22 - 01:31:26]** This skill is in addition to the skill gained via the drone's ability.

**[01:31:27 - 01:31:33]** You can't change the skill unit when the gain levels change.

**[01:31:33 - 01:31:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:35 - 01:31:36]** Is this a lawyer question?

**[01:31:38 - 01:31:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:31:39 - 01:31:41]** I'm down to change it.

**[01:31:41 - 01:31:43]** We have just made rulings in the past that you can't assist.

**[01:31:43 - 01:31:44]** Really?

**[01:31:44 - 01:31:44]** Yeah.

**[01:31:45 - 01:31:48]** Like literally in the episode that came out in episode 110.

**[01:31:48 - 01:31:48]** We did.

**[01:31:48 - 01:31:49]** We talked about it.

**[01:31:49 - 01:31:53]** So like I'm down to change it if the rules support it.

**[01:31:53 - 01:31:54]** That's fine.

**[01:31:54 - 01:31:55]** Like I'm down to be wrong.

**[01:31:55 - 01:31:58]** I just want to make sure that we know either way because I wrote it down too.

**[01:31:58 - 01:31:59]** Why don't we ask the rules lawyers?

**[01:31:59 - 01:32:00]** I mean, we haven't pinged them in a while.

**[01:32:01 - 01:32:01]** I think it could be interesting.

**[01:32:02 - 01:32:02]** Let's ask the rules lawyers.

**[01:32:03 - 01:32:08]** I can tell you that for the sake of now, like, who's going to ask the rules lawyers?

**[01:32:08 - 01:32:09]** Rules lawyers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:32:09 - 01:32:10]** Well, not me.

**[01:32:10 - 01:32:10]** I don't know.

**[01:32:10 - 01:32:15]** I think someone else can better frame the question because they're... That's the question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:32:16 - 01:32:17]** Is that in rules and mistakes that we ask?

**[01:32:18 - 01:32:19]** At firm?

**[01:32:19 - 01:32:20]** Is it the firm?

**[01:32:21 - 01:32:22]** At rules paralegals?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:32:22 - 01:32:31]** According to ChatGPT's interpretation of the Starfinder rules, it says they can.

**[01:32:32 - 01:32:33]** Which is nothing.

**[01:32:33 - 01:32:34]** It means nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:32:35 - 01:32:37]** Yeah, that's funny.

**[01:32:37 - 01:32:38]** You should look up Google's AI things.

**[01:32:38 - 01:32:39]** They're really funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:32:39 - 01:32:42]** Mashable had a really good collection.

**[01:32:42 - 01:32:49]** Okay, so for this purposes, you're able to maybe as Bernice is coming up here, you're like, oh, I got it.

**[01:32:50 - 01:32:52]** Didn't we roll really well though?

**[01:32:52 - 01:32:53]** Do we need all this?

**[01:32:53 - 01:32:54]** Right, so that's what I'm saying.

**[01:32:55 - 01:32:56]** You have disabled the alarm.

**[01:32:57 - 01:33:04]** With the roll, without the assist, because we can figure it out later, here's, you are able to disable the alarm.

**[01:33:04 - 01:33:05]** And now, Dr.

**[01:33:05 - 01:33:08]** O.K., you're gonna try and open the door, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:33:08 - 01:33:09]** Yeah.

**[01:33:09 - 01:33:13]** Do I get the plus two insight bonus since I just redid it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:33:13 - 01:33:16]** No, that was only to disabling the alarm.

**[01:33:16 - 01:33:18]** That's not to unlock the door.

**[01:33:18 - 01:33:19]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:33:19 - 01:33:21]** Okay.

**[01:33:21 - 01:33:23]** I got a...

**[01:33:23 - 01:33:29]** 13 plus... Oh, my engineering is 13, so 20 seconds.

**[01:33:29 - 01:33:31]** Is this engineering or computers?

**[01:33:31 - 01:33:33]** This is engineering to unlock the door, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:33:33 - 01:33:35]** This is engineering to unlock the door, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:33:36 - 01:33:36]** Yeah.

**[01:33:36 - 01:33:37]** I assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:33:37 - 01:33:39]** Okay.

**[01:33:40 - 01:33:44]** It's a good thing that you assisted because you almost didn't get it, Dr. K.

**[01:33:45 - 01:33:48]** It's good that Rick assisted the last second.

**[01:33:48 - 01:33:51]** I mean, that was an insane roll.

**[01:33:51 - 01:33:52]** You got a 26 on your lock.

**[01:33:52 - 01:33:53]** It's great.

**[01:33:53 - 01:33:53]** It's great.

**[01:33:53 - 01:33:54]** It's f***ing great.

**[01:33:55 - 01:33:55]** A couple things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:33:55 - 01:33:58]** You're like picking the locks and then Rick kind of just puts his finger on the top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:33:58 - 01:33:59]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:33:59 - 01:34:01]** And pushes it with enough pressure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:34:01 - 01:34:02]** You're like, it's cool.

**[01:34:03 - 01:34:04]** Yeah, like all of Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:34:05 - 01:34:05]** O.K.

**[01:34:05 - 01:34:06]** 's hands are used.

**[01:34:06 - 01:34:08]** I broke my old bump key breaking into that other place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:34:09 - 01:34:09]** Okay.

**[01:34:09 - 01:34:10]** Finder's responding.

**[01:34:11 - 01:34:13]** We'll see what he says.

**[01:34:13 - 01:34:14]** Do you open the door?

**[01:34:14 - 01:34:14]** He just did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:34:16 - 01:34:24]** um hold on he says do they get before we talk about it let's figure it out later because for the sake of the story let's keep going so cool what's up uh

**[01:34:25 - 01:34:25]** So what do you do?

**[01:34:25 - 01:34:26]** The door is unlocked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:34:27 - 01:34:32]** Well, Kaniko, is your sneak high enough where you don't need my invisibility?

**[01:34:32 - 01:34:33]** I have a plus 15.

**[01:34:34 - 01:34:37]** I don't know what that means in this context.

**[01:34:37 - 01:34:39]** I don't normally sneak around, so I'm normally invisible.

**[01:34:39 - 01:34:41]** Is that good enough where you won't be spotted most likely?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:34:41 - 01:34:42]** I think I'll be okay for now.

**[01:34:43 - 01:34:46]** I think you should use the invisibility on somebody who's not as proficient in sneaking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:34:46 - 01:35:12]** what do you given your knowledge of this hallway is it better to say have rick like go down another one and then you kind of split and then like come back and then uh report on the general whatever uh you know what i mean like the whether there are people walking around or not or are you enough to kind of like get the lay of the land um would you say i can i can try and do that if that's possible yeah i can just go um rick and see everything more or less uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:35:12 - 01:35:14]** I know that there are a couple hallways here.

**[01:35:14 - 01:35:20]** I think we may want to just see how we feel about which one is which.

**[01:35:21 - 01:35:22]** And we can stay on comms.

**[01:35:23 - 01:35:25]** But it sounds like the garage is right across, right?

**[01:35:26 - 01:35:28]** So we know that, and we want to see what else there is.

**[01:35:29 - 01:35:30]** Okay.

**[01:35:30 - 01:35:35]** I think since I've been here before once, I think I can probably try and confirm what there is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:35:36 - 01:35:37]** Fantastic.

**[01:35:37 - 01:35:37]** Can you go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:35:38 - 01:35:38]** Do you want to do that?

**[01:35:38 - 01:35:40]** Go ahead and do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:35:40 - 01:35:40]** Okay.

**[01:35:40 - 01:35:41]** Yeah, we'll follow your lead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:35:41 - 01:35:42]** All right.

**[01:35:44 - 01:35:46]** She does a couple of things.

**[01:35:49 - 01:35:49]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:35:50 - 01:35:51]** Opens the door and shouts.

**[01:35:51 - 01:35:52]** They're right here.

**[01:35:52 - 01:35:59]** They're right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:35:59 - 01:35:59]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:35:59 - 01:36:00]** You're standing up.

**[01:36:00 - 01:36:02]** Maybe you're like starting to move out of the way.

**[01:36:02 - 01:36:04]** So can you go can move by you?

**[01:36:06 - 01:36:06]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:36:06 - 01:36:08]** Slide over to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:36:08 - 01:36:09]** Slide to the right.

**[01:36:10 - 01:36:14]** You step, as she steps up, you're, you kind of trip on something a little bit.

**[01:36:16 - 01:36:18]** You look down, there are a couple of boxes.

**[01:36:19 - 01:36:20]** One's knocked over.

**[01:36:20 - 01:36:21]** It's one of the luxury goods.

**[01:36:24 - 01:36:27]** It's an Akatonian sleeper kafak.

**[01:36:30 - 01:36:32]** And you're thinking, like, where have I seen that before?

**[01:36:32 - 01:36:38]** And you remember that it's one of those weird delicacies that's, like, very specific.

**[01:36:39 - 01:36:41]** Because it's a kafok.

**[01:36:41 - 01:36:45]** It's a larval kafok that's preserved.

**[01:36:47 - 01:36:51]** So that way, when you open it, it will wake up for just a few moments.

**[01:36:52 - 01:36:53]** No.

**[01:36:53 - 01:36:55]** And then it will die instantly.

**[01:36:56 - 01:37:18]** few moments later and it's one of those things where like some some species like vesk yusokis they like to eat it so they'll wake it up and it's wriggling and then they'll they'll eat it they can feel it going down their throat into their stomach and then it dies really weird

**[01:37:19 - 01:37:22]** And you're like... What the f*** is that doing here?

**[01:37:22 - 01:37:25]** And there's like not just... One of them.

**[01:37:25 - 01:37:26]** It's like... There's a bunch.

**[01:37:26 - 01:37:30]** Like they really want to feel some wriggling... Live... Larval caffat.

**[01:37:32 - 01:37:34]** And then the door opens.

**[01:37:35 - 01:37:37]** And as it opens... Dr. O.K.

**[01:37:38 - 01:37:42]** Colin... And... Rick.

**[01:37:43 - 01:37:46]** Everyone sees across from them... The garage.

**[01:37:47 - 01:37:49]** And another... Double airlock door...

**[01:37:51 - 01:38:05]** To the left, something in your heart, like in the goodness of your soul, something like pings coming down to the left.

**[01:38:06 - 01:38:12]** There's something that just makes you say, I want to know what that is.

**[01:38:13 - 01:38:17]** Feels like somebody's in trouble.

**[01:38:19 - 01:38:20]** And that's our game.

**[01:38:21 - 01:38:22]** Lots of things.

**[01:38:23 - 01:38:25]** Lots of things happening.

**[01:38:25 - 01:38:26]** I have a question.

**[01:38:27 - 01:38:31]** And none of that bit is enough.
