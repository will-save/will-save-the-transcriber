**[00:01:52 - 00:01:52]** Yeah.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:55]** And I jump on to the bike and I just speed off.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** And then the car explodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:58]** Yeah.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** Yeah.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:40]** Just drop a gear and disappear.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:00]** Let's reach into Pandora's box.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** Let's see what comes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** I'm going to put on my gloves and I'm going to reach in.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:05]** Do you need my social security number again?

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** I do.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** I would love that.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** Let's start with the banter.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** Start with the banter.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:11]** Okay.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** 1 through 10.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** It was A.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** 11 through 20.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** It was B. This was A.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:16]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** I like this one.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:18]** I actually like both.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** This one is from Taco Monk.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** Thank you, Taco Monk.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** Thank you, Taco Monk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:23]** Appreciate you.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** The Monk of Tacos.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:26]** Good to see or hear from you.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:29]** Apparently his name is Kyle, by the way.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:32]** Maybe he doesn't want to be outed as Kyle.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:32]** No, no, no.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** He's on Discord as Kyle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** It says Taco Monk Kyle.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** Who cares?

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** He made it public.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:43]** If you do submit, you can tell us what name or you would prefer us to call you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:47]** And if you ask us not to say it, then Kelly will shout it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Specifically.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** Yeah.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** We'll bleep it live.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** Will's really good at bleeping live.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:53]** It's perfect.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Here's the banter.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** I'm only five minutes late.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** Here's the banter.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:08]** Like Starfinder gods who have portfolios they look after, if you were a god, what would your portfolio be?

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** Return stocks?

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:12]** What stocks would the gods be invested in?

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:16]** I am curious what you mean by portfolio.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:23]** I'm wondering if Takamaki means like... It's like the... I'm going to Google Starfinder portfolios.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** It's what?

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** It's like what they govern.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:41]** okay yeah like so if i would you be the god of basically like snacks for example is that what he's asking oh my god i think you are you are the god of snacks skelly that is it why me it's done because you just thought of it just now in the moment yeah i mean that would be a fun god to be

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:57]** portfolios it does say if you go to a on a on srd.com and go to uh deities says name pantheon alignment and portfolios so yes like for instance yomide is honorable battle humanity justice valor


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** I'll start.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:07]** My portfolio would be video games up until 2020 or 2006 probably.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:07]** 2006.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:10]** That's probably where everything started phasing out.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** So anything before that.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** What do you mean phasing out?

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:18]** Because I joined the Navy and then had a family and now I don't have time for video games anymore.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** I try to keep up with that.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** I know, right?

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:29]** And then, of course, comic books and I am the ultimate authority on Batman and that's why you guys are all wrong about Superman and Batman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:32]** You're incorrect, my friend.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:34]** You're entitled to your opinion even if it's wrong.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:39]** Or Batman, a good friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:39 - 00:06:01]** yeah okay i buy that's fair yeah for sure yeah yeah totally that works yeah it does it does anyone else um i think my domains my portfolios would be it's one portfolio oh just one no no no no it's one portfolio portfolio is multiple things right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** What is a single portfolio?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:07]** A portfolio is a collection of works.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:10]** You buy an ETF.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:10]** Right.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:13]** No, mine would be whiskey, probably.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** Curiosity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:23]** And, I don't know, metaphor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:29]** He's like a bard-esque kind of god or something.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:29]** That's true, yeah.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** I'm down for that.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** I could do that.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:34]** A little, like, Dionysian, right?

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** Am I using that right, Will?

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** Like, you know, a little, like, Dionysus kind of thing?

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:40]** I think it's called Dionysus.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:47]** Back when I was rolling with the Greek god Pantheon.

**[00:06:47 - 00:07:10]** yeah rolling deep showing up rolling out to mount o rolling up at the mo hey what's up man yo we should we should take back fire from these primitives no just kidding i'm just saying sticks is whack i don't know why they keep trying to vacation there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:15]** Side note, Blood of Zeus is very good on Netflix.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:17]** That's what my Greek fix besides the game Hades.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** Kelly, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:50]** headwind um if i were to steal from the uh pathfinder starfinder pantheon of uh portfolios i would be probably erori history knowledge and self-perfection i can see that if i'm just talking off the cuff then it'd probably be like something around creativity and like design things like that things i like to do yeah that's true um

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** Or, you know, like illicit substances.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** Maybe that would work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:03]** I like that there's always one antithesis in your, you know, it's always the opposite one that you just throw in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** Yeah, who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** Yeah, who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:08]** That or I'd be like Loki and I'd just be the god of mischief.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** I could see that.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:11]** See, these all fit.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:14]** These all fit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:19]** This question reminds me a lot of the book American Gods, which I highly recommend.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:22]** It's one of the first contemporary fantasy books that I've read.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:35]** The whole premise is American gods are fragments of classic gods that have come over, but then there's these new gods coming up, like the god of freeways and the god of the internet.


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:54]** those things that didn't exist in the old world that's cool i'm really interested in this now i've never heard of like contemporary there's a whole series yeah it's great cool yeah there's a whole i don't know about the show i haven't seen the show but but yeah american guts check it out yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** Neil Gaiman.

**[00:08:55 - 00:09:00]** Kelly, would you be the god of Japanese culture?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:06]** Make me a random Japanese god like Izanami or something like that?

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:08]** That's possible.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:12]** I would want to be the god of...

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:14]** I feel like I was looking up gods in Starfinder.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:17]** It seems like Waden is a pretty cool god.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** Discovery, equality, exploration, freedom.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:31]** I feel like, because I was looking at Besmara, but she's kind of a douche apparently, so I feel like if it was the good parts of Besmara or basically just Waden plus piracy, I think that'd be really cool.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:36]** Like a pirate that explores the uncharted seas would be a cool god to be.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** That would be a cool portfolio.


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:39 - 00:10:03]** so in reality it yeah yeah so it'd be like chaotic good john i would love that actually chaotic go to be fun yeah that's very yeah i think here's that's the thing i guess that's very here's again all i feel like we're all pretty like in touch with knowing like when we say it no one's surprised i feel like mine mine are pretty on on brand two music but you can't

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:08]** Yeah, I'm thinking, like, sound and music, right?

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:13]** Which also translates a little bit into communication, which really made me think about stories.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:21]** And I was like, oh, that feels like God of, like, music and, like, narrative stories.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** You know?

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:23]** Feels right.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** He's a bard in real life.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** The bard god.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** There's a god of Bards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** I don't think there is in Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** Is it Bard Simpson?

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** In D&D?

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** Is this D&D?

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Ogma?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** Oh, it's Skyrim.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** Bard Simpson.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:49]** Ogma's like the god of... Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** Millil in D&D.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** I'm not as familiar with the 5e gods.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** Now it is.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** But I do want to call out this one cool god that I just saw.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:01]** Jalvari is a neutral good god.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:08]** Their portfolios are disproven hypotheses and experiments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:12]** That is a very neutral sort of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:14]** That's pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** It's a god of scientific reasoning or something like that.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:21]** A scientific method, which is a necessary god, I think.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Yeah.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** That's rad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** That's right.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:24]** Good question.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** Good question, Taco Monk.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** We all got kind of serious.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:29]** Thanks, Cal.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:30]** Thanks, Cal.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** Appreciate you.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:31]** Thanks, Cal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:34]** I don't think he's going to like that.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** He's probably not.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** I'm going to have to stop listening.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** I'm sorry, Taco Monk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:40]** All right, we apologize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:45]** We're sorry if that was... I want to know Taco Monk's favorite tacos.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** Chime in and tell us on the Discord, please.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** That's a great question.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** We never even asked.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** We're assholes this entire time.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:57]** We've known it for a while now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** We apologize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:04]** Also, would you be the... Would your portfolio be monks eating tacos?

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:06]** Those are just like, yeah, little listeners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** Just monks eating tacos?

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:10]** Or is it like monks and tacos?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** I'm going to ask him right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:21]** If you're interested in finding out, perhaps Taco Monk will post in our Discord, which is all the more reason that you listening should pop into our Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:30]** What if they're anthropomorphized tacos, but with a vow of silence and they wear cowls and stuff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** That's kind of disturbing.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:40]** Maybe they silently contemplate the essence of tacos without ever enjoying one.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** Because they're sacred.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** That's deep.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** Can we have a one-shot about that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:48]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:51]** Where you will all be different types of tacos who are all monks?


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** And you're not eating.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** And you're trying to be not eating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:59]** I want to be a hot dog for this, and then we get to debate whether hot dogs are tacos.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:02]** Get out of here, man.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** If anything, a hot dog is a sandwich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** Just to be unnecessarily contrarian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:10]** Of course.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:11]** Question.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:17]** Who has not had a subscriber sentence that they have said?

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:18]** Anyone?

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** Will.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** Wait, no, I said one.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** Sorry, I took it back.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:23]** I was going to say it.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** So, yeah, Will's going to say it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** I was just raising my hand for Unity.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:29]** Well, what I'm going to do is, I think I'll... My thought is this.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** This is new.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:30]** This is new.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** I'll roll it.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** John's changing the rules.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** What the fuck are you doing?

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** I was just going to wait it towards you, but fine.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** I'll just do whatever.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** That's fine.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:40]** It's all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:44]** I'll just do a... I mean, if you want to wait it, I'm not going to say no, but like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** What do you think, y'all?

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** Should we wait it or should we just say no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** You are the GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** You should be the decider.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:52]** Fine.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** I'll decide.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** I'm not even going to tell you what I'm doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:59]** Should you roll the dice to make that decision and then roll for... Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:00]** All right.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:00]** I've already decided.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:01]** Are you going to fudge the roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:05]** As soon as you message me, John, I'm just going to be like... This dice roll means nothing.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** John's already decided which one of us gets the sentence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:14]** Welcome to part two of what it means to be a GM.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** Part one was last week or the week before.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** This is part two.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:19]** Hurting cats.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** Hurting cats.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** And I'm going to message that person.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** Don't hurt cats.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** That's not nice.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** On Discord, privately.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:26]** I'm going to message them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** Nobody hurts cats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** You said hurting cats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Oh, hurting.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** H-E-R-D.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** Hurting.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** It's an expression.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** Hurting.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Hurting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:39]** I have messaged the individual who has that sentence.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** It is now up to them.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** And it's not me.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:41]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:46]** You just said you can choose Will or not, basically, is what you said to them.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Like, hey, Will hasn't had one in a while.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:52]** Okay, if Will doesn't get chosen, then whoever this is is kind of a dick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** I'm just going to leave my face permanently like this.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:59]** I feel like Finder would troll him and not do it for the rest of the episode.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** Guys, a couple things.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:01]** One.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** In general, this is to you.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** We can leave it on air.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:12]** I am doing my best to be more descriptive in my descriptions, for lack of a better term.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:17]** And so, if you all are like, John, please give me some more clarity.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** Please give me some more things.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:21]** If there's anything I'm missing, you always shout it out.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:24]** But I'm just trying to encourage you because I'm trying to...

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** my game here.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:29]** So, please, ask me for more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:32]** Can you describe what you mean by that, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:36]** It's just like, this is a master class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:40]** This is a master class in how to do it.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:44]** With that, too, I also want to say just a general thank you.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** We just don't do it enough.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:50]** Just a general thank you out to The Willing, to everyone who listens to us.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:53]** Wherever you are right now, you are fantastic.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:57]** Whatever you're doing, just know that we appreciate you a lot for listening.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:03]** Appreciate you tuning in every week, wherever you are right now in the story.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:06]** And also, shout out to our coffee supporters.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Appreciate you all as well.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** You're fantastic.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:15]** And a general note, we will see you, because this episode comes out in the middle of July.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:19]** And we will see you, hopefully, in a few weeks at Gen Con.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:24]** Just a reminder, we are going to have our first ever in-person meetup.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:29]** And it's going to be with... You can see how Kev needs platform shoes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** How Kev is the shortest of all of us.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:31]** I'm going to learn.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:34]** I bought those leg extensions.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** Kevin's baby spice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:38]** I got those leg extensions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** The ones that tall people walk on.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** The people from the circus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** Stilts.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:48]** So that's Friday, August 2nd.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** That's our question next week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:52]** Which Spice Girl would you be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:58]** Let's answer it on Friday, August 2nd at Tappers at 7pm in Indianapolis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** If it's not posh, then it would be sporty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:04]** Next week, save it.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:08]** John's trying to announce where we're going to be.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** I just won't even say it any further.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** He's just going to mute you guys.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** No, no, John, say where we're going.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:18]** I've already said it, but you were talking over me, so they'll have to go back and figure out how to get back.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** But I need to find my way there.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** I know, I know.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:23]** You need to know, Kelly.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:25]** Because you're going to buy your flight the day of.

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:59]** No, Tapper's Bar.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:05]** That's our first ever meetup, and just in general, we're super excited to be able to hang out with anybody and everybody who's there.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:09]** Like I said, we'll be doing that with STF, who the STF network is fantastic.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:16]** I'm looking forward to meeting more people.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:22]** I met Adam digitally, but that's a little good to see other people in person and him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:23]** Alrighty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** Let's play.

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:03]** I think maybe we should pick five machines and we could do a round robin and see the highest cumulative score.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:09]** Just to be fair, because some games are left dominant, right dominant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** I'm going to have to do my research on them.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:13]** Get all my combos in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:15]** If they have Mars Attacks, man, that was my game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:17]** Terminator was my game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** I'm just going to show up and ball.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:24]** I actually just bought a pinball company and I'm going to supply them with new pinball machines that I've rigged myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:30]** I'm going to bring my flipper and hack into it.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:30]** Check it.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** Last week.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** Two can play that game.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:34]** Two flippers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:36]** Look at you, Vinny.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** But you don't have the black one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** Let's play.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:39]** Last week.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** On Will Save.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:43]** On Will Save.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** The unthinkable happened.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** Keniko got caught.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:53]** If we want to go back a few steps, here's a Keniko.

**[00:19:53 - 00:20:02]** You all made the necessary updates in the garage in the wee hours of the morning of 730 p.m.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:07]** And you made the updates to the police cruisers.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:13]** So that all four of you are now drivers for the vehicle.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** You can unlock the vehicles.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:21]** And you can do so and start them, move them, drive them without setting off any sensors.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:25]** That was two hours of work for the two of you.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** Pretty extensive.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:35]** You all were able to avoid notice from the patrols of stewards that were walking by.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:37]** Then when you're leaving...

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:45]** The Patra and another Sharon steward noticed Kaniko going across the hall.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:49]** She decides to play.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:53]** Oh, I just needed something here from the garage.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** I had this with me.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:56]** Pulls it out of her back pocket.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:01]** She kind of takes the fall and the door shut and you are separated.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:03]** Here's Kaniko.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:11]** She undergoes an investigation with the Patra and eventually Inspector Jock's herd.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** And you are worried.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:16]** You didn't leave the warehouse.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** You waited.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:20]** Then you went into the hangar to not be in a restricted area.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:21]** You're waiting.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** You're trying to talk to her.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** You're able to talk to her a bit.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:25]** She tells you maybe this will be okay.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** It's kind of worrying.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** You get bits and pieces.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:29]** And it's a little unclear.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:32]** And I remember I could feel your uncertainty about what do I do?

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:35]** Do I wait for Kaniko or do I try and break in?

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** You're talking to the others.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** You're trying to figure it out.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:42]** And then eventually you decide to go to sleep.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:54]** And when you do, the door opens and you can see down the hall that she is standing at the checkpoint into the quarters that you and the other Paratons are staying.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** She returns to you.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** Things are okay.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:01]** You debrief and you all decide you're going to sleep for the night.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:06]** Wake up in the morning and you get a text from

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:13]** I think you get a text from Shay saying, hey, good news.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:18]** I have got some armor for you.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** The thing you've been asking for for a while.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:27]** And also, there's a chance that you all will actually be able to leave pretty soon.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:28]** GTFO.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:34]** We're waiting to hear on news from Roselight today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** Roselight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:41]** So I'm going to bring you guys back to your party on the map.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:49]** The only other thing that I remember is that I believe Kaniko had said, hey, let's meet up again tomorrow before bed.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** Kaniko or Nico?

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:54]** Kaniko had said, let's meet up before bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:57]** I didn't think a ghost was telling us anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:57]** No.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:00]** And let's talk about our plans.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** Let's talk about what we found.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** Let's, let's iron this out.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:08]** So with that, I'm going to unpause the map and it's about seven in the morning.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** You all are up.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:13]** You're all in Colin and Dr. O'Keefe's room.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:16]** And what are you all thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:23]** All right, so before we go any further, this is a metagame, but I remember us talking about Roselight, but that might have been after we stopped recording.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:30]** So I don't exactly know if I made it back into the cut, and I don't want to leave anybody stranded.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:38]** But the other thing with that is, does Hears tell the group about his message?

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:44]** Otherwise, I'm not going to roll a culture check on Rosalite if Hears keeps that secret to himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:47]** Okay, so this message came through on my comm, correct?

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:48]** Yeah.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** It's like a text, okay.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** Yep.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:58]** Hears is like, everyone, we're probably going to be able to... Wait, who said this to him again?

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:03]** Shay told me that we'll be able to soon.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** No specific time.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** I personally think we should stick to the plan.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** But I just wanted to let you know.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:14]** And what was the Rosalite thing again, please?

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** They're waiting on word from Rosalite to let us go.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:22]** They're waiting on word from Rosalite to let us go, which is one of the 20 characters that keep popping up that we haven't met here.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:25]** I don't know where these like endless characters just keep- Rosalite's not a person though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** Okay.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:36]** So now I know the real answer, but so I got a 13 plus two is a 15, but I have a theme knowledge for law enforcement that reduces it by five.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:38]** I'm the DC by five.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:49]** got it my my bounty hunter and also i think yeah i'm gonna leave that at that john you can play with it what you want uh thank you thank you for that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:50 - 00:25:02]** Roselight is one of the main cities, not the capital, I think, of Leovara, which is one of the gaseous planets in the middle of the system.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:13]** Leovara is considered like this beautiful paradise of a planet, stunning colors, stunning flora and fauna in whatever forms they may take.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:18]** And it's also home to the romanticized dreamers.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:22]** who are Barathus, right?

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** They're kind of cousins of Barathus.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:36]** And Barathida is more or less the safeguard of Leovara in general, their beauty, their wealth, right?

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:45]** And so Roselight is this floating cloud city in Leovara that is, how do I say it?

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:48]** There's a lot there.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:55]** You can think of it as kind of an offshore place where a lot of companies are able to get a lot of things done remotely.

**[00:25:55 - 00:26:18]** shadily it's also under the kind of the corporate governance of the barathus and there's a lot of like biomedical there kev you would know for sure that there is a a big steward's base on rose light and there are companies like the the fairwinds gas corporation right there's a lot of gas mining that happens there because of you know it's a gas planet

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:25]** So, in general, it's a little bit off-grid, but a beautiful place that many people will go to.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:32]** There's a lot of tourism, a lot of mystery, and kind of theories around the dreamers.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:37]** And, in general, big city nearby, right?

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** You are on a moon around Prithita.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** Luvara is nearby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:45]** Do they extract, tip on a glass, gas?


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:45]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:48]** From the depths of the planet?

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** Like in Bespin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:57]** They do extract a lot from the planet.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** It's a big, big resource.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:01]** Small enough to go unnoticed by the Empire.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:04]** Yeah, absolutely.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:07]** You can think of them like petroleum platforms.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** Helium, hydrocarbons, exotic compounds.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:27]** And each one is different, but obviously you can imagine these are pretty dangerous tasks to be working on these gas mining platforms deep in the clouds as you get closer to the surface, whatever surface there is of Roselight.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:57]** cool cool i think out of all that rick just tells him like that that is the nearest uh base for the stewards that's all he says yep and this see like we're we're on tier callous which is a moon of you're on tier callous base which is on varus which is a moon of brithida that's yeah yes and which is the next planet over from levar for playing pack world geography cool yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:01]** So I vote we stick to the plan.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:03]** What do you all think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:06]** Question, Rick.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:12]** You mentioned there's a steward's base at Rose Light.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** Do you know what they do there?

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** What are they known for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:22]** Well, it is the nearest, I guess you would say headquarters.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:26]** It's not the main headquarters, but it's the nearest precinct for the stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:32]** Is it pretty common knowledge that there's a base there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:36]** Yes, it is not clandestine in any way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:51]** I'm just wondering if these, you know, I've speculated a good bit about whether these stewards, riddle stewards, seems like something they would know to help fake their front, if you will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:56]** I would have to say that my suspicion actually falls more on Shay at this point.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** I mean, don't get me wrong.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:02]** I believe that all the stewards here are up to something.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:06]** But here's, can we trust Shay?

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** Especially after what he showed you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** I don't think that's the reason not to trust him.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:16]** I don't think we can confidently trust anyone, Rick.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** But we've made our bed with Kaniko.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:21]** And I feel like we should follow through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:21]** Yes.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** I agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:28]** We have a sure way out versus betting on something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:34]** I once had a partner respond with, I know, when I told them that I love them.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** It's not cool.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** It's f***ing rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** Thank you for sharing that.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** Whoever did that.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:48]** Whichever one of you coffee subscribers did that, I appreciate it, but like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** I tried to slip it in.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Thanks, Taco Monk.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** That was fantastic.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:57]** I didn't deliver it well enough, apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** I actually thought it was brilliant.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** It just, yeah.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** It's fine.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:06]** Written by the fine Monk Tacos.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** Taco Monks themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:14]** Still got a little hot sauce and it's going to be real good, that quote.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** Yeah.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:19]** I think we should take the for sure bet.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:21]** We've made our way out.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** We just have to follow through.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:30]** Let's not rely on any chance, really, that we're taking with someone else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** Aye, I'm with you.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** Let's blow this popsicle stand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:38]** I'm not in the mood for waiting for some rubber stamp from a bureaucrat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:56]** yeah if it was not for all the other circumstances from the last 24 hours hours hours hours hours then i i would say the same but you don't leave something else

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:13]** No, no, I guess I do agree with what you were saying, that we should stick to our original plan, that word from a random individual to hearers of all people, letting us know that we are waiting on a foreign base to give us the authority to be let go.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:16]** I do not trust this situation.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:23]** And especially with everything that Kaniko has said, I do think we need to look into Orviet before it goes any further.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:25]** Okay, I just need to clarify something.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:29]** You said that the message came to me, here's, therefore, you may not trust it.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:34]** And then you said you don't trust the situation, which means twice you just called me untrustworthy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:34 - 00:32:00]** which i'm a little bit upset about rick and i just want you to clarify what it does not it's it's it's only your title if it is used within your name correct here's the situation no no you can use a standalone like i'm glad we're clearing this up right now but yeah so every time that i say the situation referring to a situation you were you assume that i am talking about you i mean if you if you talk about here's and then immediately followed up with something like that i might suspect that that's

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:07]** If I talk about the situation, if I talk about here's and then immediately followed up with the situation, then you can assume that I'm talking about you.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:11]** But if I just speak about using the situation, I'm not referring to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:15]** We're going to work this out over time.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** Anyway, I just wanted to drop that in.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:21]** But I think we're all on the same page.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:24]** The cars are ready to go, by the way.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** That's my name.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** Page is my name.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:56]** we made sure that they're good and uh we you know we also will be driving our ourselves so we're not entirely reliant on kaniko right like we'll have our own transportation too just in case she turns out to be you know untrustworthy did we get clarification are the peritons in on this will they be taking their ship yes i believe they're taking their ship

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:00]** Or they're taking the transportation.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:00]** I can't recall.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:01]** What do I recall?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:05]** Well, Shay's a steward, not a parrot.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:05]** Right.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** Of course, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:15]** Kaniko has always said that she needs to look after her crew, so the paratons will be coming as well.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** And that they're on board.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** She went and kind of had a chat with them.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:28]** Yeah, Orvier will not be coming because she has, you know, she thought she could rely on him and then can't.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:30]** She could be bull****, but we'll find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:30]** Okay.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:30]** All right.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:34]** So y'all want to get some good rest tomorrow during the celebration.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** Let's make our escape.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:39]** Sounds good to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** Well, it's 7 in the morning now, right?

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:44]** Let's all make our escape soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** I had a great sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:46]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** So you all have woken up.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:51]** You know that the celebration starts around, I think I said 1600.

**[00:33:53 - 00:34:01]** And Kaniko has said at some point during the day that she wants to meet up, finalize everything, talk about what happened.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** So I'm going to turn it over to you all.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:05]** What are you feeling?

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** What are you feeling like doing for the next few hours?

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:13]** Let's go for the next few hours and see what you want to do.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** That's sus.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:07]** Rick is like reading over your shoulder and he sees that text and he reads it.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** That is sus.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** Totally.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** I didn't see you there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:12]** Totally stupid.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** Yeah.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** It is rather sus.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** Creeper, Rick.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** Creeper.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** God dang it.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:18]** We're going to get out of here before I can grab it.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:18]** Oh, well.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** He puts his like comm away.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** No, don't you understand.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:22]** What do you want?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:24]** He is telling you.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:41]** that there is something you want and you will get it once we have approval from the stewards that it is just adding into the suspicion i understand let's waste his time if nothing else and have dr okay some orders and things that he wants and if it turns out that we get it before we depart then that's cool doctor what do you want


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:44]** I'd love some weapons.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:46]** I wouldn't mind some armor.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** So I do have some.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** So armor for doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Okay, please.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** All right.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** So what kind of weapon do you want?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:54]** Let me, let me do some shopping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** Orbeer's armor was pretty sweet.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:59]** If I could borrow that again, I'd like to.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** I don't know if I could wear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** So Rick was hoping he could get some armor like Orbeer's.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** All right.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** I'm jotting all this down.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:05]** Keep going.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** Keep it coming.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:11]** I think at least the level of Orgoth's armor, but possibly, hopefully way better.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** I'm just going to let you know that right now, Shay.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** What else?

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** Yeah.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** It's just a draft.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:19]** I haven't sent it yet.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** So whenever you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:51]** uh yeah i mean if you all want to look right now and tell here's what you want that's fine you can do that also you can just think about it in general while you're telling me what you're planning on doing kind of for the next few hours i'm gonna ask for some healing serums i think that's like appropriate right healing serums please uh let's say let's get 10 of those and uh yeah 10 mark 14s yeah 10 mark 14 healing serums good idea rick

**[00:36:52 - 00:37:11]** secret slime amazing okay so you send that off signal jammer signal jammer check i hope someone's putting this in the chat or in the notes or someplace where they will remember it and can put it down if not it's all fiction


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** Signal jammer.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Uh, so yeah.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:33]** So yeah, you remember, you remember Kevin as you're doing this, I'd say it's maybe like seven 30 now after you've been talking, you've been, uh, kind of getting ready and you get, you all get a text on the, on your group chat with Keniko and she says morning.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:40]** Uh, she asks how y'all slept and says, do you want to get some breakfast and we can finalize everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** Yeah, let's get some brekkie.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** All right, everyone, breakfast time.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** All right.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** Just heard from Colin's girlfriend.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:49]** We're going to meet in the kitchen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** Colin's real quiet in the corner until that message comes through.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** He's like, guys, it's time for breakfast.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** It's time to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** Colin just bolted right out of bed.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** I'm not going to tell you, though.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** Playing it cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** Playing it real, real cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:08]** He's got like these four strands of hair that he can't quite get perfect, but he's obsessing over in the mirror.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** You look good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** It's all about the confidence, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** It's always about the confidence.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Are you sure?

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** Yeah, I'm sure.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** I think it's about the hair.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:19]** It's driving me crazy.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:20]** You look glorious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:23]** He traces one and tucks it behind your ear.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:25]** Whoa.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** You're going to be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** Hey, you know what?

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** That's fine.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** You do you.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:32]** All right, let's go.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:33]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:35]** Rick kind of leads the way out the door and down the hall.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** Which way is breakfast again?

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:41]** Is it in the large square room or the smaller room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** It's in the smaller room.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** I promise I can read.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** The clock says 730.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** I thought it said 1730.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:51]** And so I was like, why are we going to breakfast at 530 in the evening?

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:52]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:52 - 00:39:20]** you're like shoot we already missed it it's 30s early though this is like kevin hours like status it is kevin hours it is kevin hours yeah no it's just it's just true it's what it is who's at the end of the hallway sylvania i'm gonna i'm gonna go naturally she you were the only one who's made her laugh so so she kind of just like has like a little like half smile and a nod


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:28]** So as we enter the cafeteria, mess hall, whatever you're going to call it, there are how many people in here already?

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** Four, five?

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** And they are all Peritons?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:38]** Yeah, there are Peritons, Orgat, Sparkles, Sarzel, Ludvaya, and Kaniko are already in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:48]** I think Rick kind of grasped his gun just a little bit when he first sees them, just as a flashback to what happened on the bridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:56]** Here sends a message to Shay for now, and he mentions that Dr. O'Keefe might need something else.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** We're here to go for Toby.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** We'd appreciate it if we could get that.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:02]** And you sent that to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:05]** Hold on, I'm still adding things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:08]** Well, just put it... Stand by, Shay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:12]** Shay has not even read your message yet.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Okay.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:14]** You walk in.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** You all start ordering some breakfast.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:19]** Whatever you're getting, Kaniko comes up to you.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:24]** She, you know, appears to be totally fine.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** Not the exasperation that you saw last night.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:32]** Here's after that whole interview, let's call it.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:39]** And everyone else seems to be on guard, not at you, but just things are just a little like this.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** There's a crackling anticipation in the air.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:47]** People know that you've come in, that you're talking about what's going to go down.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** Yeah, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** I'm sure at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:50 - 00:41:12]** yeah they're they are they're friendly and not you know they they hand you plates they try and make make small talk but you can tell it's just a little exciting yeah break out of prison it feels like that right now if i was playing fallout right now i would i would control asset and then i would i would throw them under the bus and see what happens

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:34]** oh i just got an email from paizo there's a function to save your game wild uh directly from uh the top here lead them on and then like be the last one through the door and then shut the door behind them and then the stewards come down on them so hard and you're just like oh that sucks


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:51]** but um oh what was i gonna say for real now i'm gonna get sidetracked uh yeah it's it makes sense that they're all tense because they're gonna be joining us potentially yeah we should talk about that

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** Hey, yeah, look.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:55]** Before we go further, I have a question for you.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:57]** Do you have any updates on Orvier?

**[00:41:57 - 00:42:01]** His location, his status, his well-being?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:01]** No.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** I haven't seen him.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:05]** He's been missing for how long now?

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** I haven't seen him.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:11]** I haven't seen him in maybe, I'd say... He kind of looks at the rest of the Paratids like, none of you?

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** Like, that's not... No.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** Is that normal?


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:15]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:18]** Uh, well, Keniko speaks up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:20]** I, I usually check in with him once a day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:31]** Uh, I, this is the second day, you know, we got here two days ago and all the events of the past, like 10 episodes have been in for just yesterday.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** You came in, you had your first chats, uh,

**[00:42:56 - 00:43:07]** And so within not even 48 hours, you are ready to leave, which speaks to how great we are, how much of a red flag a lot of these actions have been.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** I haven't talked to him.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** I, I suppose I'll see him today.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:16]** I'm not, not certain, but,

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:27]** My question to you all is, is this, and also here's, thank you again for waiting on me last night and for checking in.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:49]** Colin, Rick, thank you for coming with it's.

**[00:43:50 - 00:44:00]** It gets your heart racing when you decide to make, when you take actions like this, you sneak into places that you're not supposed to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:04]** That's one word for it.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:05]** Yeah.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:08]** And you can tell that she's thinking about her conversation that she had with you here, right?

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:11]** Where she's like, want to make sure that she's doing the right thing.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** Doing the right thing, Keniko.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:13]** I just wanted to say that.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Thank you.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:15]** I would let you know.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:21]** And Sarzael and Orgat, you can hear them be like, yeah, yeah.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** That's right.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:32]** There's a growing sense of confidence there in this room around what you need to take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:38]** Dr. O'Keefe and Colin and Rick, you all made it back all right last night?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:39]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:40]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Okay.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** We slept soundly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:44]** Good.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:47]** I did, too, after my chat that I had.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Let me tell you.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:54]** Inspector Heard can turn on the heat when he needs to, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:54 - 00:45:17]** he is a definitely a hard ass and uh but you know you're you're you're harder because like you pulled through it and slept slept good that means you got the stuff to be a leader never doubt yourself this this reminds me of some of my past experiences i've been in in your position with a crew like this i've seen this before i've been there and uh i think you're doing a good job can you go thank you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:25]** And once again, Ludwia kind of slams her mug down in agreement.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:33]** And they all look at you in sort of a way that they really feel connected with you.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** So I know, Rick, you had that moment.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:41]** But you sense from them that they feel really appreciative of the four of you in this moment.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** All right, look.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:46]** We need to figure out what our timetable is.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:50]** We need to get on the ship.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** She was looking at her crew.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:58]** And you four have vehicles that you can get into and get out of.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:08]** In order to do that, we need to open at least the hangar door for the starships in the starship hangar.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:12]** Have you thought about how you're going to open the hangar door for the garage?

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** It's in the same place, if I remember.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:25]** And I think Rick here, as you all had deduced that last night, that the command center is where you can open up those hangars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:29]** Yeah, we know and we're prepared.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** And we had a long rest, right, John?

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** You did have a long rest, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** Because...

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** because you started early.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:37]** Yeah.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** Yeah.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:46]** You got a long rest because, because frankly you did things early.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:50]** So I think by, by the time he got to bed, it was, you know, 10, maybe 10 30.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:50]** Great.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** Cause we're good.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** So what's our time table here?

**[00:46:56 - 00:47:03]** The party starts at 1600 and I'm thinking that we need to

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:07]** Get on our ship and... Wait, wait, sorry.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** I'm getting ahead of myself.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:11]** You all are coming to the party or you're not coming to the party?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:14]** We'll make a brief appearance for appearance's sake.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:15]** Okay.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:20]** And then maybe we'll strike up a conversation about...

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** Terraforming Agaton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:32]** I think that as long as it doesn't set off any... Actually, come to think of it, where is the party being held again, Kaniko?

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:34]** Is it in the hangar with the starship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Yeah, it's in the hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** Okay, that's a little bit problematic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:39]** They had some tables set up.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** Yeah, you...

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:44]** I've got an idea for that.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:46]** Colin, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:50]** I was just going to say, should you already be on the ship?

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:54]** Are we late at this point?

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:54]** At what point?

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Right now.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:59]** They're already setting tables up.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** Is it going to bother?

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:07]** Are the tables going to block your hatch to get onto the ship or have...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:10]** You know, I like your thinking, Colin.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** I'm not worried about the tables.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** No, it's okay.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** God, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:19]** He just kind of puts his hand on the bed.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:22]** That's a really good question, Colin.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** I also was wondering that.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:26]** But the tables are not going to be a problem.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:26]** I understand.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:29]** Ludvig is like, it's a good question.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:33]** She's like, yeah.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:35]** Colin likes to think of every contingency.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** He likes to develop contingency plans.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** He's just being smart about it.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** Okay, so I agree with him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:43]** So what I'm thinking is this.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** Let me know what you all think.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:54]** I think that what I'll do is during the party, I'll give a tour, in quotes, of the Periton.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** They haven't seen it.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** Maybe just like one or two.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** Maybe trying to think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:02]** The name of the Periton ship is Periton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** Tweak.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:08]** Tweak sauce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:08]** Wow.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** Okay, you know what this reminds me of?

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:15]** It reminds me of the True Warriors from, like, that one... Whatever it's called.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** Okay.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** The Pike's Pirate Tattoo.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** No, no.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** The True Warriors are True Warriors.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** The True Warriors were less cool than this, for sure.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:27]** But, like, no, the Piratins are cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** Oh, the True Warriors on Junkers.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** The True Warriors are dumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:33]** Well, their headquarters were also called True Warriors.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** Yeah.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:37]** It was a gym called True Warrior.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:39]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** It was a gym called True Warrior.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:44]** Had a rival to fight with.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** Yeah.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** That's a CrossFit gym.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** Of course it is.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** True Warrior CrossFit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** True Warrior CrossFit.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** Ten bucks says it actually exists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** They weren't even a game.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:56]** They were just a bunch of people that did CrossFit together.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:58]** They were trying to tell Akaton about CrossFit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** Yeah.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** Yeah.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:01]** That's it.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** Just trying to open a franchise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:09]** Dude, there's a true warrior fitness in Los Angeles.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:13]** I'm not surprised about that at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:16]** I am becoming a member at this very moment.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** Should we do this?

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:19]** I'll go and learn some Muay Thai.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** So the Pike Paraton ship is called the Paraton.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:30]** So what I'm thinking is I'll give them a tour of the Paraton and maybe most of... I'm sorry, who are you giving a tour to?

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** One or two of the stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:36]** Just like... Do you intend to kidnap them during this...

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:38]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:40]** What do you plan to do?

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** So we'll give them a tour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:54]** I'll have maybe, you know, Ludvaia can show them kind of a tour of some of the weapon systems and Sparkles can show them a look at some of the piloting and the navigation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:58]** And then... Kick them out the door and fly away?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:58]** Right.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:06]** So at some point, you're going to give me the all clear and say, hey, we're 3, 2, 1, about to go.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:12]** And at that moment, we will subdue or get those one or two people to get off the ship.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** And maybe we'll do it very quick.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:19]** But the point is, we'll all be on the ship and we will all conveniently not get off the ship.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** So we're ready to go.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** And Sparkles can be sitting at the piloting.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:22]** Right, Sparkles?

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:30]** And then we can just crank her up, doors open, wheels up, we're out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:41]** I don't mean to make this any more difficult than it has to be, but I think your signal to go would be the doors opening, since they must be mechanically or open remotely from control.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:45]** Which I'm assuming you think that we will be taking care of that.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Yeah.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** You're implying that we will be taking care of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:52]** Yeah, that was the plan, is for you to open up the hangar.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:55]** I will take care of that.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** Don't you worry, you're here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:00]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:04]** Colin's going to take care of business.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:04]** Good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** You don't want to be on the ship with him?

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:10]** Without a computer or an engineering skill to be spoken of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** I'm sure it just needs healing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:21]** I'm actually... Sexual healing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** Just to really f*** myself, I'm going to roll a bluff check.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:28]** Because he has none of those skills and he's never seen this room.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** That's a 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** Total.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:36]** She nods at you and then looks over at Hears and Dr. Okay.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:40]** And it's like... It's still nodding.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** Your dog is eating and I'm hot.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:49]** Okay, so you're going to open that up.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** I agree with you, Rick.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:58]** The sign is that if you could just give me some heads up, though, so I can at least, I would like to avoid, you know, punching these stewards.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:03]** And the other Pikes Paratons are like, yeah, we don't want to have to fight.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:06]** That's just a complication here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** We'll give you a sign.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** We'll talk to you on comms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:36]** here's what we'll do we'll ask about your terraforming Akiton game last night oh I love terraforming Akiton it's great isn't it it's so good so when you hear me ask about that on the comms you know you've got about 30 seconds before we hit the button is that enough time yeah that's more than enough yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:43]** It will be mildly suspicious that all of our crew are not going to be there at the same time.

**[00:53:43 - 00:54:00]** I wonder if... Would it make sense to leave, say, if I go and help Colin, and then if there are two of us left in the room, and then while they're distracted with the hangar for the Starship opening, they can get out, I suppose, and then come to the... You know what I mean?

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Just looking to split the party.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** Maybe I'm overthinking this.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Well, I don't want to split the party.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:05]** I just...

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:07]** I don't want to make it too obvious that we're not there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:15]** No, I mean, I think... Didn't you say something about having her... Did you tell her about recording the terraforming Accuton game?

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:15]** Okay.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:20]** Look, they think that you're going to be there based on their footage.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:24]** And you hear Orga say, Wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:28]** They were recording in your room?

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** You freaked out?

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** What the f***?

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** All right, we are absolutely getting out of here.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** I know, I know.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** Okay, sorry.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:36]** Please, back to the point.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:38]** So... I forgot about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:39]** Never mind.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:43]** My fears have been... Yeah, I forgot about that.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** Good job, Kanika.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:46]** Yeah, I think we're OK.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:50]** And frankly, I think the four of you need to be as close to the vehicles as you can.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:51]** Right.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:55]** We don't want a situation where there are stewards in between you and the vehicles.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** You need to be able to get out there.

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:00]** So I don't know how how you're going to split up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** You know, the rooms are right next to each other.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:04]** So I don't know if you're going to have like what you're going to do there.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:08]** But we should be you four should stay together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:09]** Yeah.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** All right.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:11]** Let's do it.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:13]** Is there anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** I can't think of anything else.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** I think we're good to go.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:21]** I think we need to establish something on Orvier.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:26]** We need to understand what his... He may be a weak link to the stewards.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:33]** If these stewards are as malicious as we think they are, he is a weak link to them.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:37]** We may be able to get information on them, if not him.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:46]** We need to find out where he is, what he's up to, and possibly dig in through his files and find out exactly what he has on them or what they have on him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:49]** We can maybe do that at the command center.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** That's a good idea, Dr. Urvir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** Here's a question.

**[00:55:54 - 00:56:01]** Why is everyone except Urvir ready to jump ship, as it were?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:09]** Well, if you recall, I have lost my faith in Orvier.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:09]** Let's just say that.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:20]** I think I told Hears this last night, but I was questioning what it's like to lose faith in someone that you trust.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:25]** Orvier was one of the most competent people in my youth when I met him.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:32]** and absolutely was able to be an example for me for how to live my life.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:38]** And I'm very appreciative that my parents were able to give me the creativity that I needed, but it led them nowhere.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:43]** And Orvier had found success in action and decision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:43 - 00:57:01]** and i have since lost faith in that ever since before we went to outpost omicron i felt like he's been distant i felt like he's been withholding of information i felt like uh he's been rather buddy buddy with the stewards and i don't so

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:15]** I'm more what has happened to you all with your questioning, the line of questioning from Dr. Nodens, this quantum replicator device that they said that they wouldn't take and then they did.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:17]** That's clearly some sort of gray tech.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:22]** Orvier's complacence, his absence in talking to me and discussing.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** We've had none of those debriefings.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:27]** We've had none of that since before Outpost Omicron.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:29]** He's acted unilaterally without me.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:31]** It's been a total breach.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:38]** And I felt, and while without you, I might have thought that it was odd and suspicious and merited a discussion.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:47]** With your experiences, your trauma, everything that's happened, I am distrusting of this entire base.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:50]** And I'm casting Orvier into that same group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:51]** All right, fair enough.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** I can understand that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** All right.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** That makes sense to me.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:58]** And you see the other stewards kind of nodding.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:03]** And you're seeing their... Sorry, Pike's Paratons.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** The other Paratons nodding.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:12]** You can see their kind of acknowledgement of Kaniko in place of what would have been Orvier, right?

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:16]** Because she's actually had... She's looking out for them.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:22]** All right, let's, if there's nothing further, I'm ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:22]** One last question.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:24]** Do we have a name for this?

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:27]** Should we have like a corner operation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:28]** I think the name for this is Mutiny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:31]** Love the name.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:31]** Okay, you know what?

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:33]** Sorry, I didn't mean to make light of it.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:34]** You're right.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** Operation Mutiny it is.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:36]** Good idea, Colin.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** That's good.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:39]** Thank you.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** All right, fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:43]** You all finished breakfast.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:47]** Maybe you have some more lighthearted, as much as you can be, discussion.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:53]** Here's, you get a text from Shay.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:58]** I'm going to advance how long do you all eat, maybe for half an hour.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:15]** say it's eight o'clock or so yeah uh got something for shea yeah you get something from shea saying um got some news gonna uh reach out to you just a bit um just keep your calm unit on you

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** What are you all doing?

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** It's now eight.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** You have about eight hours.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** You know that you've talked to Kaniko.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:28]** You know that Shay is probably going to reach out to you soon, maybe.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** Is there anything you want to do?

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:34]** Maybe you all are just waiting with bated breath.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** Or maybe you want to take action somewhere.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** I don't know.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** I want to leave it up to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** Rick wants to find Orvier.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:43]** And I think with that, he's going to tell Kaniko, like...

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** Would you join me?

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:48]** I want to knock on Orvir's door.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:51]** And if he answers, I kind of need you as an excuse.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:57]** And I think possibly we could ask him to set up the tour of the Periton.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** Is that the proper term for your ship?

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** Yeah.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** Yeah, it's the Periton.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:03]** Yeah.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** We can go talk to him.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** I guess it's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:08]** And if he's not there, we're going to kick the door down and rummage through his stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:12]** So you're not okay with stealing the ships, but you're okay with breaking in there?

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:14]** Investigating.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:17]** Just like we're going to return the ships?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** Yes.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:21]** I think we're splitting ears here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:28]** Just don't let it screw up Operation Mutiny because I don't want Kaniko or you to get arrested and then we can't get out.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:32]** It might throw a wrench into our plans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** Dr.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:38]** O.K., it may be helpful if you were able to assist us in this investigation.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** Yeah, why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:41]** Are there cameras in Orbeer's room?

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:43]** Probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:46]** It's probably a locked door and cameras.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** I'm assuming Dr. O.K.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** can take care of all of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:50]** Rick is up to something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:52]** No, I just want to investigate Orbeer.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** No, I understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:56]** I just mean you have some personal thing you want to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:58]** That can do things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:03]** Maybe just have Bernice do it to avoid suspicion.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:04]** Have her do literally everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:09]** Hey, do you guys remember when he just tried to keep Orvir's armor?

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:10]** That was fun.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:11]** Orgots, yeah.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:12]** Oh, that was Orgot?

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:14]** Oh, you mean the situation?

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:16]** Oh, I... Sorry.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:16]** Yeah.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:21]** Is that the name of the situation we're talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:22]** Yeah.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:24]** Only in Orgot's armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:28]** In polite company, the situation...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:32]** Turns out Orgot is called the situation and here's trying to steal it too.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:35]** And it said the situation on the armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** And here's like that moniker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:42]** I know there's a situation, but what's the person's name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:46]** You could call it a situation ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:54]** So there's a situation, but who's the new guy that's the situation?

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:58]** My full name is Here's the Situation Fabricius.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:58]** That's it.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:01]** Okay, there's a situation, but what's the name?

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** His name is Situation?

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:09]** What kind of name is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:11]** Alright, so... Alright.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:14]** Hey, Rick, so... Do you still want to go?

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:18]** Take a look at... I mean, like, I... It'll be a goodbye for me, of sorts, if he's there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** That... Okay.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:21]** There's no need to make it weird.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** Okay, don't make it a big situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** This whole situation is weird.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:25]** And not me.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** I mean this.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:27]** This is weird.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:27]** Okay.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:29]** This whole thing.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** I can't even say it anymore.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:31]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:31]** Okay.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:31]** All right.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:34]** So Rick is going to go towards the hall.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:36]** He's going to take a quick look.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:39]** He sees... What's her name at the end of the hall?

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** Sylvania?

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:40]** Sylvania.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:41]** Sylvania.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:43]** Rick, don't fuck this up.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** Colin.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:47]** He's going to nod at her and walk down the hallway towards her.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:49]** Colin hops on the car real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** He's like, I... Rick's going to...

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:59]** Real quick, is there a risk of tipping our hand to someone we shouldn't be in?

**[01:02:59 - 01:02:59]** What do you mean?

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:01]** Checking on Orvir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:05]** Getting literally caught doing this before we try to make a game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:09]** If we don't trust Orvir is going to... I don't know.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:10]** Is this going to alert him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** Yes, it possibly can.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:13]** And that's why I'm concerned.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:17]** But I'm going to try to wait and watch and let someone know.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:20]** Check if there's cameras in there before you do anything.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:20]** Okay?

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:22]** Please.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:49]** As she turns the corner, she turns quickly.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:56]** And I think, you know, she just has like a little smile on her face and then just keeps it flat.

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:56]** Yeah.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:23]** I got to look for it.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:25]** It has a mind of its own sometimes, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:29]** I just wanted to make sure I wasn't showing up underdressed.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:30]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:38]** She looks past you at, you know, she can maybe see Bernice at the very end of the hall and just kind of like raises an eyebrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:07]** And she gives you a smile.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:10]** And it's like a knowing smile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:12]** A knowing smile?

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:07]** I agree.

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:08]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:11]** I think this is a dumb idea, but I'm going to be here watching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:16]** I don't think it's a great idea either, but I'm keeping that to myself.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:17]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:24]** Is just going to cross and pace across the hallway in front of Sylvania looking for Bernice.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:28]** Yeah.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:28]** Yeah.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:28]** Okay.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:35]** So I was going to duck into the gym to burn off some of this nervous energy because he doesn't like any of any of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:40]** You knock on the door.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:42]** There's no response.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:44]** Nothing.


## Speaker_0

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:44]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:47]** She looks at you, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:53]** Do you want to... Were you serious about trying to break in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:55 - 01:09:04]** He's going to look down at Bernice and he talks, it's like kind of rude, but he talks to Dr. O.K.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:04]** through Bernice.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:14]** And he's going to say, is it possible for you to hack into their surveillance and see if he's in the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:16]** Maybe.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:18]** Is that possible, John?

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:19]** Could I do something like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:26]** if there is surveillance in there, I don't know that you can hack into it just through the lock on the door.

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:27]** That's my only thought.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:34]** I would have to be... If you were in there, you could see if there is any in there, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:34 - 01:10:04]** I don't think I can do that I would just pretend to be dumb I would like to know his whereabouts and I do think that if he was not in there I would be more than willing to investigate his belongings I feel like here's Peaks around the corner he's like I hear what you're saying I feel like you could just have Kaniko knock because it's Kaniko and then if there's no cameras you could go for it you could open it I mean she knocks again oh is it locked


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:06]** Orvear, are you in there?

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:10]** And she tries to open it, and it... It's locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:12]** Oh my god.

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:14]** I can try to open it.

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:16]** I can.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:19]** But we have to not be dumb about this.

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:23]** Alright, and then here is just like, Bernice, watch behind me.

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:24]** Okay.

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:25]** I'm doing the devil's work here.

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:27]** Alright, I'm gonna try to unlock it.

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:28]** Give me a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:31]** Computers, check.

**[01:10:31 - 01:10:40]** It's a computer check to hack the biometric reader, or it's going to be an engineer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:41]** 29 computers.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:44]** It unlocks.

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:46]** All right.

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:46]** Can you go?

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:50]** I recommend that you go in first, not to make you take the fall for everything, but you get it right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:51]** You get another text.

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:52]** I think if you say...

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:56]** If you say housekeeping, then it's acceptable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:57 - 01:11:01]** Rick, you've had a lot of weird ideas today, but that's not one that I'm going to go with right now.

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:02]** I'm not going to entertain it.

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:04]** I'm going up here for watching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:09]** You get another text from Shay being like, hey, you on your way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:10]** Girl, where you at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:14]** Yeah, I'll be right there, Shay.

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:15]** I'm on my way.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:16]** Where does he say to go?

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:17]** Is there a security system in there?

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:19]** The hangar, I believe.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:19]** Hangar.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:22]** All right, so is there a security camera in there?

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:24]** Do I need to help with this, probably?

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:27]** Can I check if there's something in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:27 - 01:11:28]** I mean, the door hasn't opened yet.

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:30]** She hasn't opened the door.

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:30]** Damn it.

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:00]** Breaking and entering.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:03]** Just some light beany.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:03]** I'm just blown away by that.

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:08]** So, like, on the Chimera, you guys are like, let's go in every room.

**[01:12:08 - 01:12:08]** Fuck it.

**[01:12:08 - 01:12:09]** Who's in business?

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:09]** Who cares?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:10]** It's different.

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:10]** Because it's different, man.

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:12]** It's different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:16]** Because we're not trying to, like, get away in five hours from now or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:18]** Okay.

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:20]** It's only different because the crew of the Chimera wasn't armed.

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:21]** Yeah.

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:22]** Really.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:23]** This is different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:24]** All right.

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:27]** And, uh...

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:28]** I've got to remember that Dr. O.K.

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:32]** is going to let them know that I think they're on to us, guys.

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:35]** We should maybe adapt, but okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:42]** Rick says, I have adapted, and he's like, he's ready to go.
