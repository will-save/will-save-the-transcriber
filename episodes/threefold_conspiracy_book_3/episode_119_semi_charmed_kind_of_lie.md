## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:20]** Hello and welcome to my channel.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:22]** In this video, I will show you how to make a simple, easy, easy, and fast,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:24]** Welcome to We'll Say It, the podcast episode 119.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:27]** We'll say it, we'll say it, we'll say it, we'll say it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:27]** 119.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:27]** 119.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:29]** I'm John Swan, your toasty GM.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:34]** We are currently out of banter topics from our subscribers at the moment, so please send them in.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:40]** In the meantime, I'm going to ask the team what they did this weekend specifically.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:43]** What's up with SDFConline, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:46]** That was pretty good.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:49]** Oh, yeah, we played here at SDFCon, which was a virtual con.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** It was really fun.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:53]** I played Pathfinder for the first time, 2.2e.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** It was really good.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** It's so fun, right?

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** What a fun game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:01]** It feels like a tectonic shift to go from Starfinder to Pathfinder.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** I actually kind of liked it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** It was easy.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** I was talking to Finder about this.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** I don't know if I like Pathfinder 2E.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:14]** And it might be because I am so comfortable and familiar with Starfinder now.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** Starfinder 1.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:17]** 1E?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:20]** Uh, that I'm like, I don't know about this.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:26]** There were things like there's, there's no, um, since motive checks, but there are since motive checks, they're actually just perception checks.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:32]** So there is a sense motive section that says use perception and, and then like the action economy and it, it's just, it's just.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:50]** different and for one shot that I was playing at STF Conline had a lot of fun Heath was the one that hosted that game but I think I just I wasn't in love with it the way I wanted to be because I know that's where Starfinder 2 E is going to end up yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:50 - 00:03:03]** I'll say that when I did the 2E playtest with Heath and Adam and Jason and Griffin, which you should check out on STF's feed, I felt like 2E was totally a different game.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** And it was in the Starfinder setting.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:10]** But the way that I play and think about being a part of a team, absolutely different.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:14]** The way that I'm thinking about approaching the game, totally different.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** And I think that will take some time to get used to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:19]** I'm trying to find who did mine, like who hosted it.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:24]** I'm looking through STF's channels and I can't find it because I think they deleted them, like the STF Con channels.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:29]** Anyway, whoever ran the f***ing headshot, the rot, who was that, Vinny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:31]** That British guy?

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:33]** Oh, Matt?

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:33]** No, Matt.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** Matt was in the game.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** He didn't lead it.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:57]** matt ran one of my games which was oh my god it was topper toppers and it was fun yes i died i don't know the real name at the end you played delta green uh his name was chris and then thanks chris and then you died in delta green i mean that makes sense that you died in delta green yeah i was i was jealous i missed that seat by like 20 minutes i really wanted to play delta green


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:01]** I got to play Mothership with Matt Taffy Saint, right?

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** Yes.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** Taffy Saint.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** And he's an excellent GM.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:10]** But Mothership, I would describe Mothership as Delta Green in space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** It had a lot of the same themes, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:31]** And for our game, we were basically like three contractors hired on to help an android from an anarchist group get their tape on the air at this way station that's just playing this propaganda over the waves.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** And yeah, we all died in the end.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** Oh, 100%.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** It got real close, though.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:36]** Oh, really?

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** Story-wise?

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:40]** Or, like, you just died because you died in combat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** Like, it wasn't intentional.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:43]** You could have made it out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:47]** We, like, triggered all the bad guys at once, and they were swarming us.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:53]** And I actually got to use, I have this, like, laser cutter, and I cut down five of them in one blow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:53]** That's f***ing cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:58]** And then I was going to cut a hole in the wall, but I tripped and fell, and that was the end of my game.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:03]** Would you like to know the demise of my character?

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:03]** That's cool.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** always my character.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:13]** I played a, uh, Armenian American mobster criminal recruited into Delta green.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:17]** And I found some grenades early on in the game.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:28]** And as a, um, unknown, unnatural being was like working his way through a cabin we were in.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** Uh,

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:34]** I threw one of the grenades, and I hit him, but it was a dud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** Oh, no.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:40]** So you got murdered by the incorporeal super beast?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** Yeah.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:48]** I failed my sanity check, and one of the effects was that I shot myself because I lost all my sanity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:48]** Yeah.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:49]** Wow.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** Awesome.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:50]** You know what?

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:52]** That's still the green.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** That's still the green, man.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** That's so cool.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:57]** Thank you, Starfinder, for not being like either of those games.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:58]** Could you imagine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** We would have all shot ourselves right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** Mothership?

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:04]** Okay, can I just say that Mothership looks cool for two reasons.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:07]** One, GMs are called wardens, which I was like, oh, that's a cool name.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:15]** And then two, on the site, one of the taglines is survive, solve, save Mothership.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:15]** pick one.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** That's exactly it.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:20]** We solved it.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** Great slogan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:25]** We did solve the solution and that was it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:33]** I ended up getting bolted to a chair through my thighs with wires shoved into the back of my head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:59]** on top of a decomposing corpse that had previously been bolted to the chair with the it was it was like actually wild it sounds kind of fun to gm cool i blame vinny for us dying because we're all getting ready to run and vinny's character is there was there was a dj guy already in that position like basically connected to the system and he was screaming but still djing and um

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:02]** I already determined like, hey, this guy's going to die no matter what.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** We got to just go.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:06]** And Vinny's character was like, I'm not going to just leave him here.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** Even if he's going to die, I want to die peacefully.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:12]** And my character was like, well, I'm not going to let you stay behind by yourself.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:15]** And so I actually stayed behind to cut him free.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:19]** And then the two of us locked ourselves in the room and tried.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:23]** We had an escape plan, but they overwhelmed us and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:53]** it's rough it's rough man i'm sorry sorry sorry well this sounds like a blast if you want to play uh well one you should check out scf you have not already and next year when they have their next con online or however it may be you should definitely consider joining i wish that i was there i was not just for the record yeah we did oh benny and i we all made it up and we fought like 20 million zombies which is john and mine's worst fear that was but yes yes i thought grays were your worst fear


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** Actually, you're right.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** They are.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** Well, I've actually overcome that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:57]** Now it's zombies.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** It's transcended.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Is there a zombie gray?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:03]** Is there a zombie gray, though, in the threefold?

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** Hold on.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** Let me write that down.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:07]** There's a dog gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** There could be.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:11]** Dude, the gray bounder was the creepiest thing for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:18]** There are some pretty cool creatures just in general in the back of any adventure path for Starfinder or for Pathfinder.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** There's always like a bestiary.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** And it's cool.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:28]** With that, I think we should get rolling on the track here of playing.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:40]** One thing, though, we have another sentence to shout out, but Kelly, I think last time we didn't say you said the sentence and no one caught it and then you didn't drop who it was.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:41]** Wait, I did say it?

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** I thought I didn't.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:45]** What was the sentence?

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** I'm going to look it up.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** Hold on.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:49]** I am fairly confident that you said it.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** Do you want me to say it now?

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:54]** I didn't say this.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:54]** It's in our chat.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:55]** Really?

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** You didn't?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** Do you want me to say it this episode?

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** Yeah.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** Now we know that it's you, but that doesn't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:06]** Tell us whose sentence it is.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Oh, guess.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** Just take a wild guess.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:11]** Just take a wild guess.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:13]** Think of a weird sentence and it's done by that person.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** Just think of a weird sentence and it's done by that person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:18]** Of course it is.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:22]** Thanks, Finder, for submitting your sentence for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:28]** And in general, thank you to our followers and willing and supporters and everybody out there who's at our will save table.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:29]** We love you.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:32]** And also we'll see you if I am correct.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:40]** If my calculations are correct, my astrogations, this episode comes out tomorrow on no, on July 31st, which is tomorrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** Yeah, you're going to be.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** I'm actually already here.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** You're already there.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** I'm on the plane right now.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:49]** I'm live from Gen Con.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:55]** The person next to me looks very annoyed that I'm recording next to them on the plane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** It's rough to record on the plane.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:59]** You'll hear the slosh of the ice as the attendant walks by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:09]** Just f***ing deal with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:12]** There's literally a baby right there.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:16]** I'm way less loud than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** Well, we'll see you hopefully for here.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:29]** We'll see you and come by Tappers, our pod little event with SCF.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** It's on Friday.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** So come by.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** This coming Friday.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** This coming Friday, 8-2.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:34]** Tappers.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** In Indianapolis.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** And if you're not coming to Gen Con, just come to Tappers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:40]** What time are we supposed to be at Tappers on Friday?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:49]** So it's the second month of the, sorry, the second day of the eighth month of the 2024th year.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** What time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:50 - 00:11:20]** what oh what time seven seven seven local which is i believe central time uh eastern no it's eastern eastern eastern okay indiana is one of those states that has dual times right i wasn't sure which side really shout out oh my god that's i think downtown indy is like eastern eastern central time zone like what it's it's pretty close to if not right on the date line yeah the airport you land an hour later than when you get to the city is that what you're saying i don't think so


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:23]** Anyway, with that said, let's get going.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:25]** I'm going to pull up my music cue change here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:30]** Everyone grab their Astrowave to determine what time you're supposed to be at Tapper's, but it should be 7 local.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** 7 local.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** That's the easiest way to say it.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** What's that in GMT?

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:35]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:41]** Really, it matters what time that is in Packed World's time.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** Based on Apple Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** Packed World's time is universal.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:46]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** We should just do that.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** Just get rid of time zones.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:50]** Right.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** China did.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** China did.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:53]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** Let's do it.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:54]** I'm tired of this.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:58]** So, last week on We'll Save.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:03]** The event and the plan have begun.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:07]** The four of you have prepared yourselves for what is coming.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:09]** Yeah.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:15]** Keniko originally came to you with, let's say, suspicions.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:24]** about Orvia coming from some odd behavior of his.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:33]** You then shared your experiences with Dr. Nodens and her line of questioning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** It wasn't my choice though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:41]** The strange behavior of the stewards, right?

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:44]** Shay's possession of the quantum replicator.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:48]** And then Koneko was pivotal in saying, you know what?

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** I think, I think we need to leave.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:56]** We need to, I think we need to get out of here.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:58]** And so with that,

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** You scoped out the restricted zone.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:08]** You went to find some sort of, you know, you found some sort of training room with this like anachronistic architecture.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:11]** You found this like... I miss that room.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:14]** You found these sealed off...

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:42]** chapel with a magical long sword of yamade don't forget that you have that here's and an ancient copy by the dead or missing god you selectively hijack these police cruisers so you can make an escape and the plan overall sorry borrow you're right the plan overall is to unlock the starship hangar doors from the command center so the peritons and kaniko can make it out on their ship

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:57]** and then simultaneously you can open the garage doors where the police cruisers are, and you can borrow them, rendezvous with the Peritons, come back, drop off the police cruisers, and then leave.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** Yeah, no, you have to swing back and drop them off for sure.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:02]** Can we just make them go back?

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** Is there a thing you can program in them to do that?

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** Autonomous?

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:05]** I could work on it.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** I could work on it.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** I have to try it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:10]** So this is all supposed to happen.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:14]** Yeah, this is this is supposed to happen at Jackson's Herds Pledge Day party.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** Right.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** Commemorate years of service.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** It's reached this critical point.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:24]** And flash forward to the party that the two of you have left.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:33]** While the other two remain to hear Heard's speech where he's talking about we have persisted those that would discourage us.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:40]** Remember, it has started here that there will be a tomorrow where we all drink the cool water of peace.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:50]** But first, before we get there, I want you guys to close your eyes for a second.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:54]** We open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** Sorry, open?

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** Like my eyes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** No.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** Who's taking notes?

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** That same joke.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:08]** We open on a very dimly lit temporary building.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:09]** The inside.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** We see somebody sitting at a desk.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:24]** And the angry howl of the dust storm beating against the temporary housing walls is causing cracks in Colin Edenbrand's concentration.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:32]** A monotonous Osharu's voice drones on through the datapad.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:39]** Loudspeakers about the right cadence of your descriptors terms, they're stating.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:41]** Or else the subject may...

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:45]** may lose the immersion in their mind.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:58]** Collins' immersion was brittle as another pebble hit the eastward window at high speed, and he wondered which would finish first, this video or the flimsy glass.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:07]** What broke first, however, was the drone of the sandstorm as another light ship flew very close overhead.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:14]** So many ships come and go from that new mine, Colin thought, as another one careened overhead.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:26]** He wondered what find could cause such a flurry of activity in the weeks since the discovery and the months since the initial rupture.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:35]** His time here would be hitting six months soon, and they'd have accomplished more at that mine in three weeks than his whole assignment.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:40]** He couldn't rush his process, though, not with the parties involved.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:48]** The Shimmering Ambassadors, Xena Wardens, Starfinders, not to mention the medical organizations and packed world's press.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:49]** All...

**[00:16:51 - 00:17:03]** Leaving the unconnected mind operation alone and instead focusing so eager to see if the growing gems that Colin was responsible for would indeed form into shimmering younglings.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:09]** The home planet of the shimmering, shimmering sorrow so far and deep in the vast universe.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:16]** that the family that lived here had to travel for two months just to arrive on Akiton.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:22]** Their demise was tragic, with only the youngest of the well-known business family surviving.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:32]** It speculated, Collins thinking, he's remembering the latest report, that the DNA might have somehow merged with the flow and that there's a knock at the door.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:44]** The abrupt noise pulls Colin from the depths of his thoughts, and he noticed both the video had paused due to inactivity and the sandstorm had subsided briefly.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:55]** He cautiously approaches the door, knowing both who it would be already and also wondering if his inquiries or identity had caught up with him.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:58]** He gently swings the door open.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:06]** letting in first the sunset light of Akiton's sun, and then seeing a figure standing close to the edge.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:24]** With patience and eagerness both in abundance, he steadies his steps down the metal plank stairs and across the sparse Akiton ground and walks the 100 feet or so to the new edge of the cliff roped off for safety.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:30]** As he walked, he couldn't help but notice the assortment of goods on the Hilkey's hip.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:37]** The gun, the various med kit and bottles, the phase rods, the whip.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:41]** And he wondered where and when this would be of use.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:47]** He stepped up next to them and took in the new view.

**[00:18:48 - 00:19:05]** The eruption of the lava flow had not only cascaded down into Morrow's Trench with alarming speed, but it had also caused several massive sides of the cliff face to dislodge, hitting the Ringworks building and sending rock and debris alike hurtling to the trench floor.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:10]** This new lava flow had left open holes in the cliff face.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:21]** the deepest of which was right next to his humanitarian aid for Akiton Camp, overlooking what used to be the new Ringworks offices.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:25]** He felt a hand hit his chest lightly.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:31]** Looking down, he sees a full coffee mug in the Hilkey's hands.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:35]** And then the Hilkey says, Will?

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** Will?

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:38]** Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:42]** Oh, you had me close my eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:45]** I know, I know, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** It's going to be a long night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** And we fade to black.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:50]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:53]** Okay, okay.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:55]** Our tie-in to our other show.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:56]** Yeah.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** The Nano Adventure.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:58]** Awesome.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** Also Colin Backstory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** Okay, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:12]** So Colin was doing humanitarian aid during the fallout of the Nano Adventure when the Ringworks building exploded.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:14]** That's awesome.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:17]** Sorry, what is your character's name, Will?

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:17]** I forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:19]** Kara Voltar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:19]** Kara.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:24]** Yeah, so Kara then hands you coffee and says, it's going to be a long night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:27]** As soon as you mentioned the phase rods, I was like, oh, s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:31]** I was like, the whip?

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:34]** Yeah, you can surmise that.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** Tacklash, not a whip.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** Tacklash.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** Apologies, apologies.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:39]** I'll correct it in post.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** It's not a dominatrix.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:44]** I always thought she was.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** It's a tacklash.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** I swear it's a tacklash.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** That's not what makes her a dominatrix.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:50]** It's the leather and the high heels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:53]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** That's true.

**[00:20:54 - 00:21:04]** You can tell from the backstory that Colin has gone because of the massive rupture that occurred from inside the deep vent.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:20]** That obviously caused a lava overflow that not only spilled into the Morrow Trench all the way down to the bottom, but also caused parts of the cliff face to fall off and boulder and rock and lava alike hurdles towards the ground, destroying some buildings along the way.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:24]** The current theory is that...

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** some Shimmerines.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:30]** I don't know if you all know the species Shimmerines.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** They're really cool.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:37]** They're humanoid species that look like gemstones.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** And so they look like crystalline humanoids.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:40]** They're really cool.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:43]** And their home planet is deep in the vast.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:59]** And their home planet provides such a rich source of energy that most of their civilization are either like workers, which includes creatives, like workers is a generic term for engineer, artist, creative, writer, politician, right?

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:03]** Or a warrior to protect against anybody who's trying to come in.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:05]** So there's no one there who's necessarily trying to

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:11]** Like they're pretty far advanced, but their home world is so deep in the vast that a family moved tomorrow.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:21]** And so Colin is partially responsible for the fallout and partially responsible for helping field what has happened in the meantime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:26]** So they don't have any like project managers because they're not creative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** They have some project managers, but we'll go to that later.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:29]** Yeah.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:34]** There are theories about why there are Shimmerine gems.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:38]** So Shimmerine reproduce by putting – when they die, they live for a long time.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:43]** They put themselves into a – like what's – like a lava flow essentially.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:46]** And then they grow out of that lava flow.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** There's like magic involved.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:54]** And it seems that there are these gems that are growing in the wake of this lava flow of this disaster.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** And there's a Shimmering family that was killed.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:01]** So Colin is also responsible for fielding some of that aid.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** And then there's some mining going on.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** There's a lot of things going on.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** And somehow Colin met Kara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:17]** So Kara is going to be our post-Omicron.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** Kara is the big bad.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** I'm calling it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:23]** Will doesn't even know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** Knew it.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** Nailed it.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:30]** It was always part of her personality, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** So let's go back.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:35]** Let's go back to the party.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** The Pledge Day party.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** I'm going to bring you guys back on Foundry.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:41]** Let's come back to the normal packed world's time.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:44]** The universal time zone here on Tercala's base.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:48]** Are we sabering champagne at this party or what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** You are having a good time.

**[00:23:51 - 00:24:02]** They turned down the music, and Inspector Heard recently ended his toast by saying, you know, from strength to unity, from unity to strength, and everyone raises their glass.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:09]** And all the others do, and then people start to go back into talking among their stories.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:14]** The game is paused right now, but Hears and Colin have left already.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:18]** and Rick are still here at the party.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:24]** You are there with a bunch of different stewards, workers, some constables, all the peritons.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:30]** And only you and the peritons know what the overall goal here.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** So what do you want to do?

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** People have started talking.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:35]** Rick, Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:38]** O.K., what are you all doing?

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:41]** Listening to a speech, apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:41]** It ended.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:41]** It ended.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:43]** No other speeches?

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** It's just his speech and then just his?

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** Music comes back on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:50]** A little anticlimactic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:50]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:59]** is going to grab the finest bottle he can find and start going around the room pouring into people's glasses without them asking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** Folks, love it.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** Everyone is so down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:08]** They're like, oh, bring more, bring more.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:10]** They're having a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** We're having a good time.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Having a good time.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:13]** Having a good time.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** Rick, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:20]** Just trying to observe and understand what the fuck is happening here.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:26]** He's going to gradually make his way towards...

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:40]** Not, like, abruptly and not, like, pushing people out of the way, but he's going to work towards the outside and then, like, counterclockwise around the backside to get down towards where Bernice is and Dr. O.K.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:41]** so they can make their exit.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** Okay.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:44]** So I don't know how long you want me to do that.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** Do you want me to roll stealth?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** I mean...

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:51]** Are you trying to stealth your way around, or are you just making a way?

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:51]** It's just a party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:53]** I'm not, like, sneaking.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:57]** I'm not, like... You're trying to look casual?

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** Right.

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** That's sort of a bluff, maybe?

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:13]** I worry a little bit because you trying to look like you're looking casual does not look as good as you just being like, I'm just going to walk over to Dr. Okay.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** See what he's pouring.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:18]** Yeah, so if you want to roll a bluff check, you might...

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** You might look more suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** Give me my 10 plus 9.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:26]** I'll do a take 10 on my stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** You're taking 10 minutes.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:30]** So I have a 19.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** You're fine.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** You just start walking.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** And I'm assuming Kears and Colin are just waiting in the hallway.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:40]** Meanwhile, while Dr. O'Kade's being a life of the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:48]** I would like to try to sneak over to the door to the restricted area, like just before that corner.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:53]** And if I could like sneakily peek around the corner to see if anyone's at the security desk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Roll a cell check for me.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** Is there nobody at the door itself?

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** I can't see because of fog of war.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** Do you say this into your comms?

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:06]** I'm asking more for Vinny's awareness because he just walked all the way over in front of whoever's standing there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** Well, fog of war.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:09]** And if you don't ask on the comms, you don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:13]** Is there somebody standing in front of the door?

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:15]** The door to the research area?

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:19]** Colin turns the volume down.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:22]** He's like, get this joker out of here.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:30]** That is a 16 on the die for 20.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:30]** Dirty 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** Dirty 20.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** Okay.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** You go to peer around the corner.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** I would say, let's see.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:41]** Woo!

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:55]** Let me just take a... Let me just do a little quick... You peer around the corner, and as you do, you look up, and you see the ears of Red, the gnoll.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:59]** And then the ears poke over, and the eyes see you.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:05]** And you can tell that the eyebrows kind of soften and there's a smile and a hand comes up and red waves at you.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:09]** We're going to pause there for a second and go back to Rick and Dr. Okay.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** Check someone else off the block.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** At the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:24]** I'm just giving out random dusty sleigh quotes that I read one time in an old scroll.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:26]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** You know.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** Anyone here else like food?

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** No, just me?

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** Alright.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:34]** I like to drink beer, but not because I have a problem.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:37]** I drink beer because it's a solution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:45]** You can tell that people are really enjoying your presence, Dr. Okay.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** They're like vibing with you.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:52]** I mean, he needs to go to the gym when you can just dance at a party and call it cardio.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:54 - 00:29:16]** i think you are correct we are having a good time and then folks are like having a good time there is there's like an agender android who comes over just like totally get into the music and like just fist pumping in the air like really just going for it and some people are just chilling but generally folks like they know how to party


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:41]** i'm trying to think like there's not like a mathematics role uh and i don't know what the best i guess it would just be perception of because like rick rick has you know photographic memory if he can trust it um so he's just trying to recognize is everybody in this room except for the the um the vlaka astara um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:41 - 00:30:04]** and orvia at this point because because vinny just uh found red and heard is in here so is there anybody else that we don't know of or like do i recognize give me a perception check i think that's that's a that's a perception check to try and see if there's anybody else that you don't quite remember 17 plus 7 for 24 17 plus 7 for 24 okay

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** Nice.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:13]** I had set the DC to remember... I had set the DC so that way, if you succeed, you'll remember some other things.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:17]** And if you succeed by five or more, you'll remember some other things.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:20]** And if you succeed by five or more on top of that, you'll remember some other things.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Everything.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** Everything.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** Everything possible.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:29]** You notice that there are...

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** One, the first thing you notice is that red is not there.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:35]** Colin already knows this, but you notice.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:37]** You're like, okay, red's not there.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** Cool.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:41]** You also notice that you don't see Silverton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:42]** Ah, that f***er.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** And Nodens.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:43]** Is Nodens here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** You don't notice Nodens.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** I didn't see Nodens.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** You don't notice Nodens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** That's probably a blessing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:56]** How long do Dr. OK and Rick stay having a blast, having a good time?

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:01]** Frankly, maybe there's part of you that is like genuinely for a minute.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:06]** You're like, I don't I don't remember the last time that we had a party like this.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Like folks are just having a good time.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:14]** So maybe you let yourself slip into the enjoyment, knowing in the back of your head what you're about to do.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:18]** But part of you is like, dang, this is haven't had this for a while.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** Haven't been able to cut loose.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** Yeah.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** 15 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:28]** If I'm asking how long I stay at the B-roll rolls, like 15 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** But you're like a bright flame.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:31]** You make it very clear that you're like, woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:37]** When you're going to duck out of a party, just, you know, metagame and will advice.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:41]** Make a splash and then bounce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** Fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:46]** You roll in with a cannonball and then you make your exit.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:48]** So everyone's like, oh man, where, what?

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:49]** Yeah.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:51]** He was here, totally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** He did that crazy thing.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:52]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:55]** was the head of parties on Javone.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** I think Rick is the exact opposite of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:02]** The bioengineering department was the pharmacology.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:03]** Oh, my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:08]** At some point, just in fishbowls at the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:09]** Yeah, Rick.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:17]** Rick is making eye contact, shaking hands, dancing a little bit here and there to make sure that some people recognize him.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:22]** And then he's going to slip away without making a splash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** One last question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:27]** He's doing a dive in, not a cannonball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:29]** smallest dive possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:32]** You slip out the pool once you do the cannonball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:37]** What does Kev dancing or Rick19 dancing look like?

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** Is it just like the feet shuffle?

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:41]** He's doing the robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:44]** He's doing the robot.

**[00:32:44 - 00:33:09]** he's an android what do you expect from him all right my friend had this one of my friends from high school i had uh this quote on his facebook feed for 15 years and it was like any dance can be the robot for a sophisticated enough robot i think that's pretty future probably i don't know all right so you all start making your way out uh the the map is on pause so you know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:14]** Yeah, so Bernice is going to pretend to grab Dr. Okay.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** Okay.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:18]** And you have to go now, kind of.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Okay.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** Body language.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:22]** Okay.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** You've done enough.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** Okay.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:28]** I'm not saying I'm old, but it's past my bedtime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:32]** Yeah, you're like, oh, just kind of stretch a little bit, yawn.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Yeah.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:33]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** It's been great.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:39]** I'm going to head home before I eat all the snacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:43]** Grab one last, like, polyp on your way out.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** Pop it in.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:50]** Let's cut back over to Colin.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** There's a wave from Red.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:55]** And then they go back to their...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:58]** Security station for a second.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:02]** He lets out a sheepish peekaboo.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** The door's not open?

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:05]** No.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:11]** He's going to make his way to his room.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** Okay.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:16]** Because what he's about to do, he doesn't want to do in front of prying eyes.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:22]** And he's going to load...

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:45]** his um injector his needler pistol with um a substance that we will find out more about later if he has to use it okay what are the the other three of you doing you see colin walk by and go to his room dr okay and here's and rick you're not even in the hallway yet


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** I'm still at the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:47]** Oh.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** You're still at the party.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:49]** Okay.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** I thought that you were leaving.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:51]** Not yet, man.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:53]** Where the hell is Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** You paused the game before.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:56]** Some just passed this way.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:56]** Wait, Rick?

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:57]** Rick is?

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:58]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** I thought he was still in the party.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:04]** Rick's still at the party being an android.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** Yeah, he's being an ass.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:05]** He needs to hurry up.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** We got to get this done.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** All right.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** Where's Colin?

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:13]** sees him loading some weird substance.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:16]** If he had an eyebrow, it would be raised right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** What you doing there?

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** Oh, don't worry about it.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** Okay.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** This is just in case we need it later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:29]** Right.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:35]** Instructions unclear, because I feel like I should be worrying about that, but okay.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:38]** I guess we need Koneko and Rick, and then we're good to go, right?

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:42]** I guess Kaniko's staying out by her ship and she's going to do that.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** So it's just Rick.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:46]** As you say that.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** Who's not in the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:48]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:49]** The door's already open.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:53]** Rick slides through the door and makes his way into the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** Okay.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** Door shuts behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** Who's not in the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:00]** Where are you guys at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** We're in our room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** Yeah, we're in the room, Rick.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:05]** We're in the room where it happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:11]** I guess here's to make room for Rick, like climbs on the bed.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:13]** It's not like anyone will be needing it anymore.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:16]** He sits cross-legged.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:20]** It's like, is there anyone that's not in that party that we're going to have to contend with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:21]** Okay.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:24]** So this is how we set up terraforming Akaton.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:27]** Everyone draws two corporation cards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:30]** What are these little pieces for again?

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** I don't recall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:34]** Is it, is it go time yet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** It is.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:39]** Well, the round doesn't start until the first player chooses their card.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:43]** Then we go around and each player has to choose their card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** Not that go time.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** You know what I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:49]** I'm assuming, like, while we're having this conversation.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:50]** Like, it starts up.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** The loop starts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:53]** Yep.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:55]** And then Dr. Okay will give us a signal that we're good to go.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:59]** Do you need to roll computers or anything?

**[00:36:59 - 00:36:59]** No, I don't think so.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:00]** You're able to do it.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:01]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** That's fine.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:06]** There's one bogey between here and the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** There are some notables that I did not see at the party.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** Because I didn't see red in there.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:17]** I did not see red, Dr. Nodens, Silverton, or...

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:21]** Orvir, or the Vlaka, Officer Astar.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** Fair amount of people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:24]** So, we know where Red is.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:26]** Red is at the security desk.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Copy.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:31]** We can assume Dr. Nodens is in her clinic.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** Maybe with Silverton?

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** Just speculating.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:40]** I have not seen the rest of that back area, so you guys tell me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** Do you have that map again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Aye, here it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:44]** Do we have the map somewhere?

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:44]** Can I open it up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:47]** You should have it in your journal.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:51]** If you click on the folder icon for book three, you can click on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:51]** Yeah.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** It should say Tirkala Schematic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Tirkala Schematic.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:56]** Okay.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:59]** So I was trying to see if there's any other way to the restricted area.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:02]** Because I know... Yeah.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** So there's the main entrance there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:06]** There's the way through the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:06]** Right.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:07]** The good news is there is.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** The bad news is it's at the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:10]** Right.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:21]** But even once we're inside, like where was the reaction, the reactive, like the alien gear that was off towards the back end?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:28]** It's here, on the map, on the lower right-hand portion of it, next to Nodin's office.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** Okay, copy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:33]** So there is no way that we can sneak around in there.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:37]** Once we are in, we are in, we need to move fast and do what we need to do.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** What is our primary objective?

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:41]** So we need to get to the cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:47]** We have to open the outer doors.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:50]** So we have to go into the control room, guns blazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** Luckily, that's right next to the hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:55]** Open the garage doors.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:58]** Get the f*** out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:02]** Are we sabotaging anything else in the control room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** I mean, if there's a big red self-destruct button, maybe.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** Well, then... That might be a bit extreme, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:17]** Yeah, so we have to open the hangar doors to the ship and the hangar doors to the cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:17]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:24]** Which the hangar doors opening will be a huge distraction to the party because they're in the hangar.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:30]** But then it'll draw their attention to the control room because they know that's where it's triggered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:32]** Yeah, so we should do that last.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:41]** Remember that Keniko said that she is going to give a tour of the Periton ship so that way she can be ready to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:43]** Because the Peritons will already be on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:49]** And she will do her best to take out or neutralize the stewards that are there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:49 - 00:40:15]** jettison just shoot him out into the fucking lava trash disposal unit i think we were prepared all right let's move and rick stands up and he his artillery rifle uh who's taking a point shifts and turns into a um his pulse cannon or whatever it is that's a non-lethal


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:19]** Yeah, we kind of need a plan for Red, y'all, before we move forward.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** So what are we going to do about that?

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:24]** Maybe I can... Or unless we have to be really sneaky.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** Have Bernice distract him.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** Okay.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:28]** Sure.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** Like, I think that's good.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:34]** So I guess we try to be sneaky and let Bernice try to do something.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** I think it's our best shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:40]** I have full faith that Bernice is capable of what we are asking her to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** I've got an idea.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:44]** There's a bit of magic I've got.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:51]** I can make myself pretty amenable.

**[00:40:53 - 00:41:00]** So if I just, you know, if I was to present my charming self to Red, she might just let us pass, yeah?

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:07]** Oh my god, Colin, this entire time that I've been trying to, like, you could have used that with Kaniko this entire time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** I am not magicking my way into Kaniko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:13]** I'm not trying to say, I didn't know that it was like, okay, I didn't know it was like that.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:17]** I thought it just, like, upgraded your charm a little bit, like your natural charisma.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:20]** Okay, fine, that sounds good.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** I've got charm person as a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** Okay, okay.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:27]** I completely forgot that I can do this.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:31]** And Rick kind of like pulls his wrist.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** It looks like he's sliding his hand across his wrist.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:39]** And as he does that, his nanites form into a signal jammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:44]** Did he just use one instance of it to show them that you could do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** It's a move action.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:47]** I can switch back and forth with a move action.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** I'm joking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:50]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:51]** He can see.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** Isn't that the big thing about him?

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** He can see through that window.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** Isn't there a window, right?

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** Yeah, it's all glass.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** Can we crawl under the window?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** Is that something we can do?

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** One side is the door.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:05]** That's solid.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** The other side is the vision glass.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** Floor to ceiling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:13]** When activated, a signal jammer interrupts broadcast signals within four miles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** That's really good to know, Rick.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:18]** I'm sure that'll come in handy at some future point that's not now.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** So I'm glad you brought it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:24]** What I'm saying is that it doesn't matter what happens to Rhett.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:28]** We could walk over there and completely knock him out just by talking to him and punching him in the face.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:34]** Or we could alert him and it doesn't matter because he can't send a signal to anyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:36]** He could move his body.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:40]** So if you're really going to take him out, are you going to do your thing?

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** I mean, sometimes you've got to do your thing.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:44]** So I'm happy to have you do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:53]** If I might make a recommendation, maybe we deploy the signal jammer after we get all the doors open so they can't close them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:59]** I will keep the Serum Jammer on standby, and I will use it if anything goes awry.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:01]** It'll at least give us a few more minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:08]** Guys, can we try to sneak past Red, and if that doesn't work, we'll restrain him or something?

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:11]** I mean, he's an idiot, but he's not a bad guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** I don't want to kill him.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** I've already said hello.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** He's seen me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:22]** Yeah, I'd say we go Colin's route, and then if we can't charm the...

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** Pants offered.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** No pun intended.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:28]** We go option two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** All right, Colin.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** I want to see your charm at work.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:32]** All right.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:32]** I want to see it.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** This is going to be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Okay.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:37]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:37]** Shall we?

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** No time like the present.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** Let's go.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** And Colin steps out.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** Steals himself.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** And we step in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:54]** Bernice is going to follow pretty closely, and Dr. O.K.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:57]** is going to kind of hang back in the hall.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:11]** Rick is going to approach with his pulse caster, but not make sure to stay just outside the view so he can be different.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:12]** So Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:15]** We're all watching Colin do his thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:15]** Okay.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:21]** But Colin and Pernice are standing not in view of the vision glass because that only has view of the door, but you're standing right in front of the door.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** That's two.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:23]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:33]** Actually, before we go any further, on the way out the door, Rick is going to stop everyone and say, I think we should jam the hangar door, if possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:34]** Like right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:36]** Wait, why?

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** Yeah, that way they can't come in.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:42]** Like they'll be freaking out because the door is locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:44]** So like barricade the door into this hallway from the hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:51]** Barricade the door into the hallway from the... Which door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** The one that we're pinging.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** The one next to this hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** The one we walked through when we left the park.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:58]** Does Signal Jammer lock a door?

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:03]** No, I'm saying mechanically lock it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:03]** Oh, okay.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:07]** Dr. Okay is going to try and do that real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:15]** If you want to tamper with it so it's locked, I mean, you could just lock it, but you want to set it so that way it can't be unlocked?

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:16]** Sure.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** I'll try to aid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** That may take a little while.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** So I'm going to set the DC a little higher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** I'm also going to aid then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** Yeah.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** I assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:26]** I assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:27]** Okay.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** So that's a plus four.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:29]** Okay.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** What's your engineering check, Dr. Okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** 19 on the die.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** Good roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:35]** Good roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** Why can't I do math?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** Because it's like 47.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** 32.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** Don't open the door.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:45]** Who did that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** That was me by accident.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Sorry.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:51]** Okay, so you go to...

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:57]** open it or you go to lock it and then you are setting it.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** So that way it can't be easily unlocked.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:00]** Right.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:02]** So you're going to buy yourself some time.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:10]** Uh, I'm going to say you're going to buy yourself because you exceeded by at least two because you're the hell of good role.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:13]** Uh, I did a D four plus two.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:21]** So that's four extra rounds in which if something's going on, they, they will like, they can't get in there for four extra rounds.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:41]** john's got this whole plan of having rounds for something goes on yeah i wonder why i don't know why that would be the case it just honestly seemed like the most mechanical way to keep something going because that's what you're worried about right like there's like no easy way to be like 10 minutes or something okay cool smart smart smart smart smart uh i like it

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** I'm going to add text here.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:46]** So Colin, what do you, what do you do?

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** What do you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:56]** Um, he's going to open the door, say, uh, good evening.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** And he steps in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** Oh, hey.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** How's it going?

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:06]** You catch him, like, standing up.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:08]** He was, like, adjusting some things on his desk.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** Oh, hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** Yeah.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:19]** Do you know of any sports games, like a rec league for the base happening sometime soon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:25]** Well, it's tough, because if we're going to play, we pretty much have to play in the hangar, right?

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** That's the best place to play.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:33]** And, well, there are ships there now, so it pretty much will probably just be whenever the ships leave, I think.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:37]** But we'll probably play some sort of, like, yeah.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:37]** Why?

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Do you play?

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:44]** I've been reading about this game called Cucumber Bowl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Cucumber ball.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** I've never heard of that.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:47]** How do you play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:50]** It's sort of like ping pong, but bigger.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:53]** No, I'm sorry.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** Pickle ball.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** Pickle ball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Pickle ball.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** Oh, that's cool.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** Yeah.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** How many pickles do you need?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:03]** While he's doing this, he's waving his hands, getting...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:26]** like starting to cast the spell okay but he's explaining the game to do it yeah but he's you know you take the paddle and you swing it like this and you toss the ball like this so keep in mind that you can't clandestinely cast a spell but you are trying to use the explanation in order to like yeah do you have to recite anything for the spell

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:48]** i'm trying to i can't see if there's like a verbal or there are no component yeah there's no verbal or semantic component part this is what we talked about last time we go sound right there's just that there's no way to clandestinely cast it so you just have to like and like do like uh i think you need like a feat for that and i don't have that feat

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:52]** And I think, like we said last time, this goes based on the will save, right?

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:54]** Like, if he passes the will save, then he's fine.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** And if not, then he's going to realize that you're casting a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** I think that's the best way to do it.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:01]** And he casts Charm Person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:01]** Okay.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** Is this a mind-affecting effect?

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:03]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** He's a mindless creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:07]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** Got it!

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** He's like the closest thing to that, I feel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:12]** Of course he is.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** Yeah.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:17]** All the stewards have implants to prevent them from doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** You know what DCI I need to hit for my will save, right?

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:21]** It's a will save.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** Yes.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:22]** Okay.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** Will save.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** Will save.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** Will save.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:26]** Okay.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** I think that's a single digit.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:29]** Okay.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:29]** Ooh.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:33]** That is a 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:38]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:40]** You said that was a single digit?

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:41]** Yeah.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:43]** It was the Kraken symbol on my Kraken die.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:48]** Are you okay?

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:51]** You seem to be confident there's some magic happening.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** What's going on with you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:57]** Should I call Dr. Nodens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:00]** It's taking too long.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** What is he doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:05]** I'm going to go rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:15]** Okay, well, hey, if you need me, I think I'm going to head out, but somebody will be in here soon, so just wait for a second, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** No, I'm fine.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** I promise.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:17]** I'm fine.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** You sure?

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:21]** I'll take it back.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** I'm sure it's fine.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** It'll pass before the morning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:24]** After you.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** Hearing that, Will's going to

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:33]** before they come across him.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:37]** He's going to duck into the conference room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:40]** I'm coming in, too.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** I almost went to Dr. Norton's office.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** I was like, wait, no, no, no.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** Oh, God, no.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:48]** Colin coughs obnoxiously loudly as he comes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:55]** Oh, excuse me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** Wow, that's where it's so bad.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:00]** You should stop eating those pickles before you play pickleball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** Yeah, it's that sulfur air.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:05]** Oh, yeah, it really gets you.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:05]** Don't go outside.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:08]** All right, and then he turns and he locks the door.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** He goes over.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:16]** He checks that the door to the secure spot is locked, and then he walks by you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:18]** Alright, well, I'll see you later.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** So he's going to the hangar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:25]** He literally took pity on us and just like fucking plot armored the situation.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:25]** I love it.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** Or maybe that wasn't the plan all the time.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:29]** Oh, maybe he did.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:30]** How is he going to get out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** Rick is going to take him out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Huh.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:39]** You hear him kind of... Trying to get through.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** Huh, that's weird.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** Okay.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:43]** And then he starts to kind of head back.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:46]** He's thinking about going through the other way.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:47]** And sees you.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:47]** Hey, Rick.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** How's it going?

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:49]** Something's wrong with the door.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:50]** I wouldn't go this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** Oh, that is a shame.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:54]** I was trying to get into the party.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Are you heading that way?

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:55]** Hey, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** Watch the master at work.

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:58]** Watch...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:00]** Yeah, I'm trying to go to the party.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** Why, what's up?

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** I guess I'll follow you.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:06]** I was just going to go through that door, but you said it was locked.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** How will he do it?

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** What will he do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:11]** I'm not supposed to let you go back there, Rick.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:11]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:12]** Back where?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** Back into the restricted area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:17]** Colin ducks into the gym while they're having this conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:20]** I'm sorry, but if you can't go through that door, how else are we supposed to get to the party?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:25]** Well, I guess I'll go, and then I'll just have somebody there...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:49]** i guess unlock it maybe because i can't really let you go back do you want to do any checks you like intimidate left diplomacy fucking cap him red he seemed like a nice guy it's too bad uh yeah no yes i'll attempt i'll attempt i have a really bad diplomacy but i'll attempt diplomacy okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:53]** Uh, he's just, he's just trying to convince them.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** Hey, like, let me come.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:54]** What do you say?

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:58]** Uh, if you would just let me go through this one time and you'll be escorted me.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** So it'll be acceptable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** Oh yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:01]** Okay.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** And that is a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:08]** I guess if I'm escorting you, then, then that's fine.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** Yeah.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** Uh, okay.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:11]** All right.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:11]** Come on.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** And it kind of scoots by you.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** And then he's like, hey, have you heard of pickleball?

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** I've never heard of pickleball.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Seems kind of fun, though.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:20]** Close the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:24]** But we have to piggyback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Yeah, but.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** Where's Bernice?

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** Oh, Bernice isn't.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** He goes and presses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** Turn it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** And then the door opens.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:32]** All right.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** Well, let's go.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:37]** Hold on one second here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** Wait, what?

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** Well, I can't let you all back there.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** No, I'm just trying to think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** Oh, no, we're not going back there.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** No, we're staying behind.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:45]** Don't worry.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:48]** Oh, yeah, we're going to stay here.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:51]** We're going to play terraforming Akaton.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Oh, that's what we're going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:52]** I play that.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:53]** I'm not very good at it.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:54]** I always lose.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** I always terraform the wrong places.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:57]** Yeah, that's a shame.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:00]** You probably shouldn't play it and you should continue on doing whatever you're doing.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** It seems really important.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:02]** Bye, Rick and Red.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:05]** I have a grappler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:07]** Rick, are you coming with me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:16]** I want to... Can I do a sleight of hand to put the grappler on the doorframe so that the door does not shut behind me?

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:19]** Just to give them enough time to get through.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:45]** uh sure is it not gonna open like are you the door yeah i mean he'd probably lock it but you could always unlock it oh he's gonna lock it from the inside yeah okay all right i'll go yeah you're you're in my way how am i supposed to get through so once we're all right well once we're inside is there anybody else in the hallway have fun nope there's no one in the hallway he starts walking forward take a moment to pray for red


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:45 - 00:55:04]** he starts walking forward and then you hear, uh, um, you hear Rick, you hear some footsteps down around the corner, pretty far away, but you hear a door close somewhere down around the corner.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:11]** And then you get to the first hallway and red walks up and he's like, Oh, okay.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** Hey, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:15]** So I was asking you about pickleball.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** Have you seen any pickleball?

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** I am not familiar with that.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:21]** I play traditional football.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** Oh, okay.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:24]** Which is a ball shaped like a foot.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** Yeah, that's weird.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:25]** Don't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:26]** Okay.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:26]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Well, hey, what's that?

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** So which way is he going?

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:29]** Is he not going to go through the warehouse?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:35]** There's another way into the...

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:41]** Hey, so if you go into there, then you'll just go around the corner, right?

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:44]** Around all those super tall shelves, and there's going to be a double door.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** That will get you in there, okay?

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:49]** I'm going to head into our after party.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** I wish I could invite you.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:53]** It would be very fun, but we have a little after party.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** So I'm going to go there, get things ready.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:59]** Just go through there, and then I'll shut the door, and then, yeah, we'll be good.

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** All right.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** Thank you.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:03]** Don't play football.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** And Rick steps inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:09]** And you hear his feet walking for a bit.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** And then you hear a door open.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** And then the door shuts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Can I do a perception on the control room?

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Was there anybody in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:20]** You are now in the warehouse, so I think... I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:24]** As I was stepping into the thing, what I have noticed... Oh, it's your room.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:26]** The control room has glass doors right there.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** Yeah, it does.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:27]** That's fine.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:33]** on the die for a total of 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** Before we get there, what are Dr.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:36]** O.K., Hears, and Colin doing?

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** And Bernice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:40]** I think we're going to follow, right?

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:43]** We can't until he comes back, so we're kind of stuck here.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** Are we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** You could just open it.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:48]** I thought he locked it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:52]** He locked it behind him with the biometrics, and I haven't had a chance to go back.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:54]** You want to try to unlock this with me, Dr.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** O.K.?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:55]** Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** I'm going to go for it.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:59]** It's a 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:00]** 24, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** Computers, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** And I assist.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:04]** Okay.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** And Bernice assists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** Okay.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:10]** That is it.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:10]** The DC was 27.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:13]** So you got it with 28.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:13]** Nice.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** The door unlocks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:20]** And the door opens.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:23]** You're a handy robot, aren't you, Bernice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:26]** So you pass by...

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:29]** Yeah, so you pass by the medical center, which you recall is the first door on the right.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** Then the second door on the right is the doctor's quarters.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:36]** I can't think of anything to do with her.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:40]** Then the door at the very end is the reactor room.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** And then the hallway turns left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:42 - 00:58:09]** uh should we just head straight for the uh control room does here's recall if it takes time to start these things up or they're pretty much like push to start ready to go like you know what thanks hangers open the the cars the automobiles do we have to worry about a cold start no no it's always pretty hot so you don't need to as you're walking up the hallway there is a kind of sound um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** coming in over your mic.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:16]** Hey, how's it going?

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** This is Keniko.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** Come in.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:19]** Are you all back there?

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** Sears, what's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** Back where?

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:24]** Enter the control room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** Okay, good, good, good, good, good, good.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** Perfect, perfect, perfect.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:27]** Where are you?

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:30]** Okay, well, I am... Trust her.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:33]** I am... Well, we're on the Paraton.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:36]** I'm watching some people walk up from the deck right now.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:41]** I just... It's just me on the command deck right now.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:43]** I have to tell you all, it was a little weird.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:46]** After you left, um...

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** After you left, it was just odd.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:58]** A few of them went in and grabbed something from the warehouse, and they came out with these little things, and they came back.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:02]** Rick, you didn't see or hear anybody when you walked in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:06]** I know, I'm worried they're going to walk in right now and kill me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:11]** They came back and they all kind of like stood in a circle.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** It's a little weird.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:17]** And then they pulled out this little jar of something.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:21]** It looked like a little being and they all like shook it.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:24]** And you could see it like...

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:46]** like move and then and then i'm sorry i'm just waving to people being friendly totally normal uh-huh uh and so then they they they ate it while it was alive yes it was just kifak larva have you never seen that before no it's you also would just know that it's like a little weird to like that they all just like did that

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** Anyway, so she's like, yes.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:55]** And then I heard them all like toast and they toasted and like this, I don't know, strange language.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** It was weird.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:58]** And then I was just like, hey, do you want to go on a tour?

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:02]** And so that's where they're going now.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:04]** I will say sparkles.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:11]** like was really friendly with some of them and they, they walked back into the back.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:17]** I, I, I don't know where, where they went, but Sparkle and a few of the other stewards were going into the back.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:19]** Um, a little woozy.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:22]** I think Sparkle's had a lot to drink, but right now I'm just giving a tour.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:25]** So I, I keep me updated.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** Where are you?

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** What's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:34]** We're in the restricted zone just around the corner from the access room or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:37]** We're right next to the hangar as well as a result.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:40]** Okay, we have maybe five.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** You ready?

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:47]** No, you let me know when you're there, because I need to let everyone, all the Peritons know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:50]** Red mentioned that he was heading to an after-party.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:56]** Do you think that Skittles went with everyone to the after-party?

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:57]** Sparkles.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:57]** Sparkles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:00]** I wonder if they're going to their sanctum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:03]** I suppose Sparkles did, yeah.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:07]** Or that, like, crazy path... I mean, I almost said pathfinder.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:13]** That crazy, like, old-looking room with, like, the... It looks like something out of history books.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:14]** Weird.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:14]** Okay.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:18]** Can you go... You said Sparkles took a few of them to a back room.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** Is that on board?

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:21]** Or is that a back room in the hangar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:22]** No, no, no.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:27]** A few of the stewards took Sparkles back into the restricted area.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:29]** Whoops.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:31]** I think I might know where.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:32]** Okay.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:39]** Well, if you see sparkles, please do your best to maybe as much as you can.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:40]** Yeah.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** Do whatever you need to do.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** Look, we need to get out of here safely.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** I want my team to be safe.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:49]** If you see her, if you can find her, give me an update.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:49]** That's great.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** If not, then that's fine.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** We will...

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:55]** I will send somebody back right now, too.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** Don't worry.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** Keep going.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** Let me know when you're ready.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** I'll be ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:00]** All right?

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:01]** Wait, send somebody back where?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:05]** I will have somebody else go back looking for sparkles, too.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:08]** I don't want to leave them behind, if possible.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:09]** Yeah, I got you.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:12]** But if you see them, then keep an eye on them.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:12]** All right?

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:13]** All right, for sure.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:19]** Can we do a culture check on the toast that they did with the Kavoks?

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:22]** Yeah, can you imitate to your best ability what they sounded like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:24]** The sound that they made?

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:25]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** Just join in.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:27]** What sound were they making?

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:33]** Yeah, it was a little like... It was weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** It was so weird.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:36]** I've never heard anything like it.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:39]** Can I do a culture check for 24?

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:43]** Can I do a culture check for this roll that I made?

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:45]** Yeah, you are not sure.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:46]** You don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:50]** Well, I never heard of that before.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:58]** But, yeah, to have different non-desk or whatever races of people eating those things is not normal.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:59]** It's weird.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:00]** It's just weird.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:02]** Thank you for letting us know.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** Yeah, yeah, all right.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** Over and out.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:04]** Gotta go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:06]** Hey, yeah, so...

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:35]** cuts off she like clearly switched back to tour mode this is the bridge and the uh so what do you all want to do we're back to we should be sneaky just in case there's no reason not to be rick you didn't see anybody in a command center when you walked in you gave a quick like look over let's do it then you didn't see anybody there and and so like as they're they're coming up from the hall uh rick will open the door it's unpaused but it's paused yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:37]** And he's going to step out.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:43]** And I think it kind of startles you guys because you didn't know I was in the house.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:49]** But he sweeps his gun to the left, and he's going to kind of just strafe over to the control room.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]** First, bud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** And he's going to watch the hall.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:56]** Actually, he's going to step out and check the hall up to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:58]** I guess here's looks in the control room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:01]** Doesn't see anything still.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:29]** here's you look in the control room dr k just walks in past you uh but while looking in uh and you see that there's a a broad desk there's kind of a secretive semi-circle off to the right in the southeast corner allowing someone to sit there and they can see through the wall there are two terminals set up behind the desk two chairs there and you see a door in the northeast section

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:49]** my god yeah i do and then that's all that you see rick you walk up and you see to the right you see that there's the door that is jock's herds uh room all right and then you also see that there is the door immediately in front of you which you might maybe remember is the training center


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:49 - 01:05:15]** i remember but rick doesn't know he just sees the word training and just assumes it's just a gym because i don't know i don't remember kelly told us that what they saw dr okay your question no do we can we get on the computers i'm guessing they're secure well do you want to sorry i i i just haven't got back to you yet that's it i was just i was asking what what rick wanted to do yeah rick what are you doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:16]** Standing guard.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:17]** Okay.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:17]** Standing guard.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:18]** Okay.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:19]** Should we try to open them up?

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:21]** Can we do that from here?

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:25]** Well, while Dr. Okay is doing that, Colin's going to start checking out this door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:27]** Yeah, I'm also curious.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** But here's what will help Dr. Okay.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:35]** Colin just has no computers or engineering abilities at all.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** So he's going to open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:43]** You realize that this door here, Colin...

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:47]** The room that you're in is the command center.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:52]** The room that is beyond there also says Inspector Jockshard.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:59]** And so that is likely his office, his quarters.

**[01:05:59 - 01:05:59]** Yeah.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:05]** It's some, it's connected to his office and it makes sense that he would have a private quarters area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:10]** So you're saying his office is at, is also his home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:13]** He has an office in his quarters.

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:15]** Oh my God.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:16]** Yeah.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:21]** And here's you.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:45]** look down on the desk in front of you it's pretty clean you do see a battery charging station there are five batteries and four high capacity batteries swiping that just grabbing it you go to i assume hack in yeah yeah i'll help you out doctor okay go ahead and give me your computer's check

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:47]** This is tense.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** This is good.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:49]** You're in the command center.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:51]** Hack in the computer.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:52]** Rick is taking watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:12]** Okay.

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:15]** Rick, you're standing there.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:19]** I don't know if you all are saying anything on comms, but you're waiting.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:20]** It's quiet.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:23]** And then the door to one of the warehouses opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:24]** We've got movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:27]** We've got movement.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:28]** We've got movement.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:33]** Hopefully it's Koneko's lieutenant, whoever she sent out.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:35]** in the warehouse.

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:38]** Hopefully not.
