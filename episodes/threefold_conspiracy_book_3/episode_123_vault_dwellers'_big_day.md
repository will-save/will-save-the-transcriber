**[00:00:00 - 00:00:02]** Hey, y'all, how we doing?

**[00:00:02 - 00:00:10]** This is your top of the episode, your early intro GM, John Swan, and I'm coming to you with a little something new.

**[00:00:11 - 00:00:16]** You see, we played a game at Gen Con that we thought was phenomenal.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]** And we said, why don't we play it?

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:21]** Why don't we try something new here?

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:34]** So, I want to let you know that today's episode of We'll Save the Podcast, where we're playing Starfinders, the threefold conspiracy in the middle of a three, that is going to be the final episode for just a few weeks.

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:35]** Just a few weeks.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:41]** While we dip into the old gods of Appalachia.

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:46]** And I am excited for you to hear what we have cooked up for you.

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:47]** So,

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:54]** Want to take a second to let you know that, let you know that we're just doing a little, we'll swerve out of the way and then coming back in.

**[00:00:54 - 00:00:58]** With that, we can't wait to show you what we're doing with Old Gods.

**[00:00:59 - 00:00:59]** A little dip.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:10]** And I want to also take a second to say thank you so much to everyone out there, whether you listen, whether you're a supporter, whether you're on the Discord, whether you're just plain enjoying the show.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:11]** Thank you so much.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:13]** It's because of you that

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:38]** that we are excited to tell new stories to try out new games to try out new things and we love that so if you're able in any way to support us we really appreciate it even if it's just saying hey on the discord or shooting us a message or a review or just smiling when you're hearing this right now that's also awesome with that let's get into episode 123 of we'll say the podcast


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:34]** And this joke is for the video listeners where I'm going to talk like Kev in his video.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** Except for on the video it's going to look fine because I'm recording locally.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** So it's stupid.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** It's a stupid joke.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** We'll jump cut it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** We'll edit it on purpose.

**[00:02:43 - 00:03:04]** just for the listener i have a super old computer and it makes everything run super slow including sending my audio and video stuff to my co-workers here i'm calling you co-workers at this point that's how you're doing hello i'm john swan i am one of kev's co-workers


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** Along with Benny, Will, and Kelly.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** We're all Kev's co-workers.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** Who do we complain to for HR?

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Who's HR?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:18]** You guys are my IT people, so... We're f***ed.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:20]** Lauren, is that who we complain to?

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** That's who I complain to.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:28]** You can drone HR.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** It is really fun.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:32]** His stream is a pretty constant.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:35]** I'd say like one frame a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:41]** No, I see multiple seconds pass per frame.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** One Mississippi, two Mississippi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** At least do ten.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:50]** So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:55]** He's on five.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** Three, five, seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:59]** He's down reach ten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:30]** he's now done so it's at least going every three seconds but uh it's also delayed by five so yeah that's the problem oh my god that's the problem all right well uh we have a real banter topic today like a like yeah your banter or like somebody submitted i do i have something i want to clarify from another question that was i don't know if i mentioned it but when we were going over what uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:37]** portfolios or we would be as gods i think i said illicit substances yeah i didn't want that to be misconstrued

**[00:04:38 - 00:05:05]** illegal drugs but more so of like toxic waste and um yeah anything that you're not allowed you're prohibited from uh handling is wait are you like a villain for cleaning chemicals planet show or something is that what you're saying like yeah you're like the opposite of gaia you're like uh you're like the god of i would i would be the god of of anything you're not supposed to have

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:09]** Included, but not including medicine substances.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:14]** But I mean, it would include, but then also it would be expanded to include.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:18]** He's saying it includes, but it's not limited to.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:23]** I didn't mean to say that.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** That is a CYA.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** Thanks for that clarification.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:31]** I just wanted to clarify that for all of us.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** Send all of your lawsuits.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:34]** Super clarifying.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** It's really clarifying.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** We'll say the podcast.com as per usual.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:38]** So good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** All right.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** I actually just throw it into our discord.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** We have a couple here.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** Alright, I'm going to roll a die.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** Got a couple options here.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:54]** Going to see which one we do.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:56]** Okay.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** Alright.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:04]** This banter topic comes from Adam of STF Network.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:07]** Title of our last episode, I think.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:10]** titler of our last episode.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** Amazing.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** Here is the top.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:19]** General takes on Starfinder's system as a whole at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:27]** Well, I refuse to play anything else, so... I don't have enough experience to compare it to anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:27]** Fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** You've played 5e.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** You've played Blades.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:35]** Are we talking about the rules of the lore?

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** The lore is fantastic.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** I think all of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:43]** I would typically include lore in system.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:44]** Right.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** System, I think, is mechanics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** I think the lore is awesome.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:52]** I think the diversity of character options is awesome.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:58]** I think there can be some crunchy rules that, you know, could be updated.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** Yeah.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:02]** That said, I'm happy to abide by it.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:02]** Big surprise.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** I feel like I agree with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:18]** I think your point about having the lore, the number of creatures and aliens that you can actually play as, it's a part of the lore, but it's also part of the mechanics.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:26]** And I think that's one of the best selling points of Starfinder is that you could be anything you wanted to be.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** Anything and everything.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:36]** And the game actually makes it really easy to port in any alien species as your player character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:38]** Yeah, I would agree that that is really cool.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** I feel about Starfinder...

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:49]** I feel differently about Starfinder as a system now as it exists today before 2E comes out.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** I felt differently about it before I played Pathfinder 2E.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:57]** Yeah, I prefer 2E's combat system.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:07]** That streamlining and getting the rules out of the way has really spurred in me a thirst for some rules-light gameplay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:16]** But this core rulebook versus the playtest, the thickness, I just love how heavy the 1E core rulebook is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** I can't see it.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:19]** I'm still like three frames behind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:19]** You gotta wait a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:25]** I can't see the girth of the rulebook that you're talking about, but I can't.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:30]** Yeah, it's gonna take a little faster.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** I would agree with that, Vinny.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** I don't see... Having just played Blades, I loved Blades.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:40]** It did feel a little bit like if I justified everything in the right way, things might happen.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** And I want the failure a little bit more.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:48]** So I do like that 2E, there's a failure that I think...

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** also goes against 1E.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:55]** And that 1E, I feel like it's very hard to die as a player.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:57]** But there are still stakes.

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:00]** But at the end of the day, it takes a lot.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:03]** A lot of conditions have to converge for that to happen.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:11]** And I just feel like 2E really makes it a point that you need to work together as a team in order to succeed.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:16]** And that feels like a real adventuring party in whatever Pathfinder or Starfinder system is.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** You're in.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** And I agree.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:20]** It does kind of get the rules out of the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:27]** That's a real easy topic for you to discuss right now because you're not the one that's unconscious and about to be hit again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** No one's going to beat a dead horse.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** I will say that.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:33]** No one's going to beat a dead android.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:35]** You're not unconscious.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** Don't forget you're not unconscious.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:37]** You're up.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** You were healed.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:42]** Yeah, so it's non-lethal.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** So that might not be an issue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:48]** I can't read what it said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:51]** So you don't know what happened last time, so you're just going to go off the recap.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Okay, that's fair.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:56]** Any other thoughts that people might have?

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:58]** Vinny or Will or Kev?

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** I don't know.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:00]** Is he okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** Is he okay?

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:05]** I know we are.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:05]** We're not saying that.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** He just vanished from the TV.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** Or if he was kidnapped.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** That's fine.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** It's cool.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:10]** It's okay.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** I still like Starfinder 1E.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** I'll just say that.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** Hang on.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Are we starting the net adventure for real?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:24]** I still feel like it is the right... Did Kelly just get kidnapped on camera and now we have to go to Vietnam as a party?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:27]** No, he got up and walked away willingly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:29]** So whoever it was... Was he compelled to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:38]** Did he suddenly just get a thousand yard stare and stare dead into the camera and stand up and walk away?

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Blink twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:43]** Except he's not on camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** He's not blinking.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** He's not blinking.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:49]** Oh, God.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:51]** He's just staring at the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:59]** I feel like one of my big takeaways from Jet and Con was we're a lot of fun when the rules get out of our way.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:04]** And so I'm really looking forward to spending some time.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** But I like the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:07]** Me too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:11]** And I think it's funny because we as a cast are split on that, I feel like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:34]** I actually think that because we are now 123 episodes into our main show, plus 50 episodes of UTT, plus 10 or so episodes of NanoVenture, I can tell now that a lot of the rules that we previously would have an issue with, we've more or less digested.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Because we've learned.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:35]** Right.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:41]** Because we've been shamed online in our communities.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:47]** And if you want to continue the shaming, go check out our Discord at discord.willsavethepodcast.com.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** And you too can be part of the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:59]** You can post a GIF of that chick from... Why can't I think of the name of the show or the character?

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** The Office?

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** No, Game of Thrones.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** Shame...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:29]** yes what up kelly your thoughts on starfinder at 1e as a system i think that the lore is fantastic as has already been said um i think the races that the huge variety of them is like awesome so you have like dog people cat people gripleys i think is what they are is like the frog people i love the frog people so he's only been introduced to like 12 of them in the last yeah

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:49]** gripply i think one of the most fun episodes just running into like 20 different races at a party that was cool um the rules yeah sure yeah are i prefer 2e like obviously like i think like uh i was i've been listening to under the table by stm you just started learning and uh emily yeah shut up

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:56]** And then Emily mentioned that she preferred the three-action system of 2E, and I agree with that take.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:56]** Yes.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:58]** I mean, it's kind of nice.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** That's all I just got to say.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** Ignore Kevin, listen to me.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** I know what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:05]** I think one thing that I'll say, though, is that I do love the rules.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** I do think there's always room for improvement.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:21]** And yes, playing 2E, I think the three action economy is, it really opens up a lot of doors, which is, thank you, Discord, for pointing out that I had an extra move action during the last episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:24]** Yeah, it shouldn't have opened the door.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** But it was cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:29]** But I think also at this point, I think we're level five.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:33]** we've been playing for two, three years and we've never been past level five.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:37]** I think this is the highest level character I've ever played outside of one shots.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:45]** Um, but listening to like STF in their season three of their show, they're like level 15 in there.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:56]** And it's, it's one thing after another, but like, oops, I forgot this rule and that rule and that rule because like star finder stacks, you know, as you get higher and higher, you're the, the,

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:02]** All the different perks you get and feats and special abilities, they all pile on top of each other.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:06]** So we really haven't seen how crunchy the rules can get.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:10]** And I don't know if 2E is going to alleviate any of that.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** That's true.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** Yeah, that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:36]** we're limited by being the lower levels uh right now like once you because if you when you get to the higher levels i'm sure things like change a lot i don't think i've ever played a game where i played a character higher than level seven max i'm sure but like once you get to a certain level these spells the things you can do are just insane you become like gods like in a game basically that's where we are with uh that's where i'm at with that might be very different into it's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:59]** spoiler but stf is um running a campaign where they i think it's already it's finished now but they end it with devastation arc which is a level they start off at level 15 and i think it goes to level 20 it's literally god wow that's crazy by the time they finish but that's the point of the story is like you're you're saving the universe yeah as a god


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:05]** I am 11 episodes away from the end of that show, so I'm very excited to see what happens.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** But I agree, it's wild, all the stuff that they can do.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:17]** And the other thing is that I remember playing a couple high-level epic characters in 3.5E, and I'm sure Benny does too, and I remember that it was like...

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:22]** I mean, that is... It's not as... It's still crunchy.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:24]** Like, that was pretty intense.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:38]** And so, I'm curious about the progression here in Starfinder, because I know for a fact, I'm listening to Single Screams and other stuff, that the 6 to 12, kind of the back 9 of most of the APs, right, are pretty...

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:59]** pretty fun because you're you've been in your character for a while you know to one area and uh and so as a result anything that comes on top of that it's like a nice flavor so you're really entrenched in your character well i think john could we do a high level campaign someday you mean 10 years past level 12 sure we can do it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:03]** I know that, yeah, I know that there's like a, yeah, it will saves rate.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:06]** We'll get there in like a couple of generations or something.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:08]** If we ever get through this.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** Yeah.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:12]** Someone's just going to inherit here.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:16]** And then we'll be playing it with like level 50 or something.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:32]** no i want there's a spell where you can summon a fleet of ships here's can theoretically do this like if he gets to like level 11 or whatever it is you can summon a fleet of ships to fire an armada to like fire down like from like space i want to do that i want to have my own imperial fleet

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:36]** Pretty dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:38]** Thank you for the great banter, Adam.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:38]** Appreciate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:39]** That was good.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** Wait, did you answer that question?

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** I want to play a high-level thing someday.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:46]** Can we just do a little semi-short story?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** Sure.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:50]** A flash-forward.

**[00:16:50 - 00:17:11]** yeah it's us doing it yeah yeah it's just a screenshot of here's calling down an armada of gunfire that's it flashback it's just him that's the first combat he's the first turn first and that's it he's done standing he's wearing a business suit right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:26]** oh yeah business here's yeah he would have the gumption to well we do know that that here's here's in the garage invisible so he could be technically getting into his business suit right now if he wanted to be

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:29]** And there's no way that we'd know until he attacks somebody.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** And then he'd come back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** He's in his birthday suit at the moment.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:34]** His birthday's coming up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:35]** That was mentioned earlier.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:38]** They call me the situation.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:44]** Do you want to know how I got that name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:47]** When he's in his suit, he's just like an 80s guy from Futurama.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:49]** He's just like a total douche.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:52]** He tries to do hostile takeovers of corporations and shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:54]** I'm an 80s guy, Frye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:54 - 00:18:19]** we're 80s guys awesome awesome to the max yeah i'm an 80s guy fry all right all right let's play let's play i forgot to cure bonitis last time actually kevin's too busy with this like little gift like this right now he could have the bonitis death like animation would be cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** I'm letting you get it out, Kelly.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** Sorry, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:31]** Sorry to derail yet another banter with our Futurama references.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** It's good.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** It's just fun to play.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:37]** It's just fun to be on and game with y'all.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:40]** Last time on Will Sid Podcast.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** The chase is on, y'all.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:47]** As you have recently discovered...

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:53]** On the private computer of stewards inspector, Chuck's Herd.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:58]** All of these stewards are Reptoids.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** One of the Pyxperitons is a Reptoid.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** And you said, let's get out.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** There's a massive... Wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:05]** Except for Silverton.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:05]** Sorry.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:08]** I hate Silverton, but I want to rep him here.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** He isn't a Reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** Yeah, for sure.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** Unless their database is updated.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Unless they haven't updated it yet.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:19]** There is an explosion...

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:34]** Presumably in the hangar bay, as you heard over the comms, that Kanika Breeze was saying that Orvier, Pike, and Dr. Nodens were aboard the Void Crier, and then there was an explosion as they fired weapons upon the Periton.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:36]** And you all said, let's get out of here.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:47]** And that, when I mentioned prior in Discord that I was not expecting, and on the app that I didn't see that coming, was the decision to just GTFO.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:50]** And I think it was a very interesting one.

**[00:19:51 - 00:20:01]** Because now you have on your heels Inspector Joxherd, Narla Yalamis, Shea Dysha, Sylvania, and Baxter.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:04]** And you are in the garage.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:07]** is in one of the police cruisers.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** Bernice is in the other.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:12]** Colin is in the same one as Bernice.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** Hears is invisible.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:25]** You have Meltaman helping you, aiding you, attacking Shay and Gnarla because of the programming that you did earlier.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** Yeah.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** It's pretty great.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** It's pretty great.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:32]** But the pressure's on because in your heads, you're like, let's get out.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:35]** Let's get out from under the thumb of these stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** So-called stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:40]** We've seen that they're Reptoids.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:40]** Yeah.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:41]** Yeah.

**[00:20:41 - 00:21:02]** you you did all this work prior you set yourselves up for all this for this moment right now to leave and last episode was when three of you including bernice were able to get in the escape vehicles they have started the hangar doors closing you have two rounds left here's his outside of a vehicle

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:11]** Rick 19 is outside of a vehicle as well because Rick 19 was knocked unconscious by jocks.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:14]** Heard then healed by Colin.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** It's pretty great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:19]** He brought it upon himself, but yeah, we do need to help us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:25]** You have abandoned the, uh, the truck.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:34]** Because it wouldn't start from here's his work to try and, you know, get it unsecured.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** Very, very, very ashamed.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:36]** Very ashamed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:47]** I would say last episode, the tension was really high and we were locked in all up because of the urgency.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** And I could feel it from y'all.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:50]** And I thought it's cool.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:53]** And I can still feel it here.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:55]** And I know it's tense.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:58]** It's the first combat after like 20 episodes of no combat.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:00]** And for this to be the first combat is awesome.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:04]** Rick19, you are laying there.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** Your eyes have opened.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:12]** And above you, you see Inspector Jock's turn.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** We're at the top of round six.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:17]** It is Inspector Jock's turn.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:18]** Inspector Heard.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:21]** Are we seeing anything on the map?

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Nope.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:22]** I didn't bring you there.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:23]** Appreciate you.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** There you go.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** Got it.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** Super smooth.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:32]** Baxter is in front of Dr. Okay.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** Sylvania is on the other side of the car from Hears who just went invisible.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** By the way, can anyone else see Hears?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** Wait, why would they be able to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:41]** I didn't think so.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:45]** I can, but I see that you... Oh yeah, I made myself invisible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** There's a good thing you can do in Foundry.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:49]** Yeah, but I guess only you can see it.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:49]** That's cool.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:51]** Awesome.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** That makes sense that you would see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Super neat.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:58]** Yeah, it adds to the immersion.

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** No one knows where I'm at.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** No one knows.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** Dr. O'Kate, you previously had pulled fire.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:09]** You did covering fire on Inspector Hurd.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:09]** Yeah.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:18]** Inspector Hurd tightens his grip, looks at you, and says, Your time will come, Doctor.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** And then he looks down at Rick.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** And he says...

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:27]** He kind of crouches a little bit.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:29]** You can tell he's trying to come down to your level.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** Oh my god, get away.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:35]** He says... Those nanobots... Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** What'd he say?

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** Nanobots are interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:41]** Those nanobots are interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:41]** F*** you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:46]** Let's find out if what they say is true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:49]** You shouldn't violate his personal space like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** Rick, his hand...

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:55]** just comes up and fingers point out.

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:05]** And it's like a 3D movie as your eyes suddenly start to see the fingers move into your eyeballs and into your head.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:08]** And you feel Herd's presence.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:22]** Push into your brain like fingers moving through your Android circuitry, rummaging around in your memories that start to come unbidden to your mind as your senses explode in a flurry of inputs.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:26]** There's the feel of gray fingers on your skin as you're being abducted.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:29]** The taste of the void crier food at dinner.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** The sight of the chimera exploding outside.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:39]** And then further back, memories are coming in from locations that you've never seen, but you feel so familiar with.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:43]** And I need you to roll me a will to save.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:51]** And as you're rolling it, you hear his voice in your head say, tell me your secrets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:54]** And Rick tells him everything because I rolled a three.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** Oh, my God.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:58]** Plus five for a total of eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:04]** Dude, is this like a Cassandra Nova from Deadpool?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** Spoiler alert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** Yeah.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** Spoilers for a movie.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** I'll bleep it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Rick 19.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:15]** You black out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:20]** Here's... Wait, wait, is that some kind of... You feel a presence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:22]** Hang on.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** Here's... You feel a presence.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:35]** In your head, in your telepathic senses, you feel a presence come from Rick's mind that you've never picked up on or felt before.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:41]** Like an earthquake, like an impulse, like a... And then, Rick, you come to almost instantly.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:48]** And when you look up, you see that Joxherd's face is just shocked.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** Speechless.

**[00:25:52 - 00:26:03]** And right as you think that he's silent, aka the very end of his turn, he says very loudly, Let the android and the human go.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:08]** Bring me the Osharu and the Shirin and hurry.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** The clock is ticking.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:12]** Well, that's not going to happen.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:15]** And that is Inspector Jockster's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** This is good.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** This is good.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** If he lets him go, then we can all get the f*** out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** He's knocked out.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** No, he's back up.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** Rick19 is, yeah, he, yeah.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:31]** The blackout was a purely flavored blackout of your brain blacking out for a split second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:33]** I was scared for a moment there, though, yeah.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** I was like, oh, no, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:48]** I mean I don't know any of this is going I heard that but I didn't I didn't get the mental imagery as my character right like there's no psychic connection to Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:49 - 00:27:04]** no no no no no uh here's here's I think is the only one who has natural telepathy and so felt this other presence like a like an earthquake and then as soon as you felt that here's Rick 19 came back to full health and that's when Jock's face was shocked

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:32]** came back full health level 20 all right wild crazy standing actually he's just beaming up at the top of the garage as like a killer i guess you could just like make like clone troopers like cover the order 66 rick do it weird that he's a new yeah i don't yeah yeah and also weird baby face moisturized thriving staying in his lane yeah

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:34]** Staying in his lane.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** It is Shea Dyche's turn.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** Shea is going to spend another round.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:44]** I'm just going to tell you, he's going to spend another round trying to keep Meltaman from acting all cray-cray.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** And he's going to do a roll.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:52]** And while I'm doing that roll, Rick19, get ready for what you want to do on your turn because you are coming up next.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:58]** I don't think anybody has any visibility really into the hallway, so you can't see what's happening.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** But you do hear... Oh, not up the hallway, though.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:04]** You're invisible and across and near the door.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:06]** You're like 40 feet away.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:13]** You do hear the sound of banging as you imagine that Shay is just banging against...

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:20]** Meltdown Man trying to get him to work, just doing the old elbow grease bang to see for his computer's check.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:22]** And I'll let you know what happens when it gets to Meltdown Man's turn.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:27]** Rick19, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** You didn't give me a whole lot of time to think about this, man.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:32]** So he reached into my brain.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** instead of killing me.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** So I have 10 health.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:40]** I'm prone on the floor because I was unconscious less than a minute ago.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:44]** Um, and I'm trying to remember the rules about whether I can pick up my weapon or not.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** Uh, that, that would be a move action, right?

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** I, that's what I was trying to figure out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:55]** I think it's, uh, I'm looking it up because I know things now about the rules.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** Let's see.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** Uh, I see drawers.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:01]** The weapon is an eye cans of picking up.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** I can't see.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** Oh, no, it's a swift action.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** No, it's not.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** I'm not that good at the rules yet.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** I thought I was.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** I thought dropping was a free action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** Oh, sorry, free action.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:13]** I get free actions and swift actions mixed up.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:19]** I'm pretty sure picking up a weapon is under interact with objects.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Yeah.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:45]** uh which is a move action um so rick is going to you're standing five feet away from the door into the hallway and you're still 25 feet maybe 30 feet from the furthest police cruiser and you're 15 or 20 from dr okay in the police cruiser behind him so rick is like incredibly confused he was like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:50]** On complete defense and ready to, I don't know, scramble.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:55]** But he takes half a breath with what Hurd had said about letting me go.

**[00:29:55 - 00:30:03]** And so Rick is actually going to reach down and just grab his artillery laser.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** Well, and my axe, too.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** They're both on the ground.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** I'm going to have to pick one.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** Yeah.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** So he's going to grab his axe.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:17]** He just clasps his hand around his axe, and then he's going to activate his jump jets.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:28]** Because jump jets, as I asked in our Discord and our paralegals agreed, it just says as a move action, you can activate them and reach your fly speed.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** So I don't need to stand up in order to do that.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:36]** But I think everybody was agreeing that you were still prone at the end unless you do some kind of acrobats.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:36]** Yes.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:45]** So what Rick is going to do with Hurd still teetering over him, he is going to shoot diagonally.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:53]** Down to the bottom of the screen and to the outside of the two motor car... What are we calling them?

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** Interceptors?

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** Police interceptors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** Police cruisers.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** Steward interceptors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** Okay.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:02]** So he's going to do that and...

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:03]** I guess technically I still have a move action.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:04]** Are you going to let me move again?

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:07]** So that's 20 feet and I have 30 feet of action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:10]** I thought your move action was grabbing your axe.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:16]** That's too... I would have just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:19]** hopped onto the trunk of the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** It's a move action to do that.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** Just go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** Yeah.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:33]** I'm going to say that you're able to push past all the pallets and carts that are there.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:36]** You shoot through them.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** And that's both of your actions, right?

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:40]** To grab your weapon, pick it up, and then to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:40]** Right.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:46]** But what I was asking is, this is 20 feet, so can I move another 10 feet along the side of the cars?

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:48]** Almost like bounce off the wall and slide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:48]** I would have done that.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:52]** Yeah, so you're like directing.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:57]** I mean, I don't see why there's any reason why you can't move up to your speed.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:01]** So that was 20 feet and then 10 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:11]** Yeah, so he slides along the ground and then he kind of like, he bounces off the wall and kind of slides up along.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:16]** So now he's right in between the two interceptors, but he's on the opposite side of the interceptors from all of the enemies.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** So he can just pause and take a breath.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:42]** okay all right so you're okay so you're up between the two interceptors okay and herd did not take an ao against you moving away obviously i'm assuming really cool i love that idea of you hitting your jump jets and i don't love what's happening with herd i don't know what the fuck he's his game is

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** Who knows?

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** Who knows?

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** Colin, it is going to be your turn.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** You are in the back of the vehicle.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** Bernice is in the driver's seat.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** Dr. O'Kay is in the vehicle behind you.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** Here's is invisible.

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:03]** And Baxter and Sylvania have been told to go after your co-workers, Dr. O'Kay and Here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:05]** Is there a way for me to get into the driver's seat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** Would Bernice let you?

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** Cool.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:23]** So you mentioned something in our last game that these have some sort of electrical pulse weapon that only works on vehicles.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:23]** Correct.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:26]** So I would like to hop into the driver's seat.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** You mentioned that these things hover.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** And so I want to hop in the driver's seat.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:32]** I want to turn this toward Jock's.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:36]** And I want to use this electrical pulse weapon on his...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:36 - 00:34:00]** power armor yeah i don't know that a power armor would count as a vehicle that's my that's my concern um but that's rad can you the other question is i don't know that you need to turn it yeah i don't i'm let me pull up that's really cool something but please it's a hover vehicle i don't know why i wouldn't be able to turn in place yeah you're just halfway out the front

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Right.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** The doors are open.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** They're closing.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:04]** You're just halfway out the front.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:04]** Yeah.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:06]** I don't see why you couldn't do that.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** I mean, you could probably turn it around.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** There's enough space.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:14]** You'd have to make kind of a three-point turn.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:19]** We're getting into this blended area of the vehicle rules with you not in person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:23]** Hover vehicle can turn in place, though, couldn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:24]** Right.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** Yeah, I'm just saying that you're halfway out the door.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** The door might not be wide enough for you.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:37]** But more important than that is I don't know that you can fire this at Power Armor because he's just somebody in Power Armor.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** It only works on vehicles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:42]** Obviously, you're the GM.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:50]** From a physics standpoint, any weapon that would work on a vehicle should also work on Power Armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:53]** But then by that token, it should also work on androids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:55]** No, because androids are organic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:57]** Shoot Rick, now's your only chance.

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:15]** I mean, I guess you could make an argument that a police interceptor's vehicle disablement or firing mechanism is designed for, like, police car chases and, like, things like that in which it would only be a disabling weapon for other vehicles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** What is the name of this weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:36]** uh it is the auto disabled literally it's just like let's just look it up sort of thing this is just for autos it's it probably doesn't even use emp it probably just uh right i imagine it's sort of like a big shock like it's a it's a oversized maybe uh let's see


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Let's look.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:41]** I think it's really cool.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** So I'm already leaning towards wanting you to do it.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:52]** I'm just truthfully trying to make sure I'm good with the rules here and that there's not anything that I'm missing that's super... You said auto-disabled?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:53 - 00:36:15]** auto disabler i'm searching archives methods and i'm not saying anything yeah there's not a lot actually out there about this attacking from a vehicle um well how would it work like what is it that it does to autos that like disables them like is it like an emp pulse or something it might even just be like uh you know if it were like a pulse weapon


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:21]** It does electric damage to the vehicle.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** It doesn't say anything about non-lethal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** It's actually part of the cruiser.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:30]** The police cruiser is the only place where the auto-disabler exists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:31]** Yeah.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:43]** I mean, like, the reason why it would work on vehicles is because the electrical charge thing, then anything that's, like, operated similarly could then theoretically be damaged, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:48]** Unless it's, like, tuned to a frequency that only works on autos.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:49]** Right.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Is there such a thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:59]** It says the police cruiser auto-sabler is programmed to damage only vehicles.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:06]** I think it's a GM ruling, or we could ask the rules paralegals, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:08]** I think they would vote that it doesn't affect Power Armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:11]** Yeah, I think by rules it doesn't.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:15]** I think it would be a rule of cool to say that it doesn't.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** So what's your ruling, GM?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:19]** If you want to give it some kind of penalty...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:28]** Yeah, the thing is that you're firing it across the room, turning around to fire it.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** You fire it like you would any normal raised weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:39]** The limitation isn't necessarily on the mechanics of the weapon itself, but the targeting system... Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:44]** That's kind of what I'm thinking, because I think it's cool, and I don't want to... Like, that's a neat idea.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** So...

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:51]** I think you would take probably a penalty to your ranged attack roll in order to fire it.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** Yeah.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** To see if it even hits.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:59]** The question is, we need to build up your ranged attack roll real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** What is the movement of the vehicle?

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:03]** It's only a front of the vehicle.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** So you need to turn the vehicle around.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:07]** What does it take to do that?

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:09]** That's a piloting check?

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** And a movement action?

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** I don't know anything about vehicle operations.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:14]** I should have looked into this.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** But...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** It's very specific.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:20]** Vehicle rules and vehicle chases and stuff like that is super, super specific.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:28]** So I think if you wanted to turn it around, you would need to do a piloting check, right?

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** And then I think from there, you would need to make your attack roll.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:34]** So you moved to get in the front seat, right?

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** You changed seats.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:39]** I don't think that that's necessarily going to count as a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** I do have piloting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** Do you have piloting?

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** Yeah, you do.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** All right.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:49]** Give me a piloting check.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:52]** Keep in mind that you also may hit the other vehicle.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** That's my worry.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** That's really true.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** Let's not do that, actually.

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:04]** Depending on how much you miss by, that's my worry, is that you're going to hit them.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:11]** You could hit the other police cruiser, or you could hit the warthog vehicle.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** That's probably TM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:16]** It's not worth it if you're going to hit the other police cruiser or even a chance of that, I think.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:18]** Personally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** I think it's cool enough.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:22]** I'm going to do it.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:22]** Okay.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** The man's doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** The man is doing it.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:25]** Vehicles.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** Found vehicles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** Let's see if I can even whip this thing around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** You need a piloting check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** Drive.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** I mean, I have room to whip it around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:34]** Piloting is a dirty 20.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:35]** Why would it?

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:36]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** There.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:37]** Yeah.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:40]** So that's your move action would be to do that.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** Yep.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:44]** Vehicles provoke attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:47]** So it would be my ranged attack or the vehicle's ranged attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:49]** Yeah, I believe the ranged attack.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** Yeah.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:54]** It functions the same as the penalty to the attack rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:58]** Yeah, like firing a normal weight and trapping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** Yeah, it would be your ranged attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:02]** And that is a 12.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** Piloting was a dirty 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** On the piloting or the attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** The attack was a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** The piloting was the impressive part.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** You whip it around.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:15]** You like throw it in reverse, do like a three point turn.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:28]** The 12th, however, as this, the lights on a vehicle that I'm picturing are like light bars are just like move around in this area that you didn't even know that there was a weapon.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:34]** It like this plate just starts to heat up and fires this blue pulse across the entire garage.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:38]** I'm going to roll to see where it hits.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:43]** I'm choosing roughly three destinations.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** 12 is pretty good.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** Did you roll a one on the die?

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** No, I rolled a five.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:48]** Okay, good.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:53]** Okay, the criteria was pretty low for you to hit the other card, but it was there.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:55]** So we're going to see what it does hit instead.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:57]** Let's see.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:06]** Okay, I have one, two, three, four, four.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:08]** Okay.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** It flies.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:18]** The shot flies across and hits the van thing.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** That's all right.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:27]** The van thing hits the van thing and the van itself will take.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:28]** Wow.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** It's a lot of damage.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** Yeah.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** This could be good.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** It's a lot of damage.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** We're not going to use that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** Someone might use that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:54]** yeah 18 points of damage to the all-terrain transport yeah it's so cool but we don't want to we don't want to have to contend with that it's wheels we've got hover vehicles yeah who needs wheels you're spinning around and you shoot it i'm gonna rotate your uh token here let's see if we can do that

**[00:41:54 - 00:42:00]** So as you're spinning it around 180, you just flipped it in reverse, right?

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** Amazing.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:06]** So as you jump in, spin it around, fire up.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** You don't calculate it right.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:10]** You're not sure of the timing of the weapon and when you need to fire.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:15]** It spins around and just goes right between here's and Sylvania.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:21]** You see the Warthog jump up like it has some sort of spring effect.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:44]** in it as the as everything charges up and like pushes off the vehicle and releases this impulse and hears and sylvania feel the like impact of this vehicle just slamming back into the ground and you kind of grab your senses for a bit at the same time as rick is just heating himself across the garage with with the jump jets awesome

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** Good try, Colin.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:46]** That was cool.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** That was really cool.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:50]** Dr. Okay, a lot's going on.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** A vehicle flew in the air.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:54]** Rick's sliding across the ground.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** The vehicle in front of you just turns around.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:59]** You see Colin, like, ready to go.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:01]** What are you doing, Dr. Okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:07]** Dr. Okay, seeing the vehicle in front of him move.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:11]** knows that Bernice is probably in the passenger seat by now.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** There's no passenger.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** There's only two back seats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** That's fine, that's fine.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:35]** is going to try and do a J-turn in the garage and smack one of these carts into the direction of Inspector Heard.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:36]** Okay.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** And then reverse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** I'm going to need a piling check.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:45]** And some of those carts have, let's say, moved out of the way because of Rick 19.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:51]** We're saying that Rick just hit his head on him as he was going through.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** He just absolutely just crushed his dome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:55]** Thankfully, I do have piling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:58]** Did what now?

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** Your dome.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:06]** You bumped your head as you're going across because you just went right through some of the carts that were behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** What are you saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:11]** I'm just saying that you hit them.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:14]** They are a significant part of the gameplay battlefield right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:19]** John, it is my pleasure to inform you that I rolled a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** That is wild.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** That is wild as hell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:25]** That's fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:52]** so so what way is your vehicle cart i don't know one of the carts and i should also yeah yeah so basically i'm moving one i'm turning and moving the vehicle i just like crank the wheel yeah and as soon as i hit contact with one of those carts with the front end of the of the vehicle i'm gonna back it up

**[00:44:53 - 00:45:00]** So basically I turned around and I threw a cart in Herd's direction.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:03]** I'm hoping that it does something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:06]** Give me an attack roll.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Just a ranged attack roll.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:12]** Yeah, so it would be d20 plus your dex.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** 23.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** 23.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:19]** 19 on the dash.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:21]** This is wild, y'all.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** This is crazy as hell.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** This is some of the craziest stuff that you've done, and I love it.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:28]** Because you rolled f***ing well.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:38]** The cart... As soon as Rick moves along the wall with his jump jets, the car, Dr.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** O.K., starts to move.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:43]** Maybe you didn't even know that Rick was shooting across the Baxters right there in front of you.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:50]** I'm Baxter had a range weapon out, but that's not good enough for a, uh, for a attack opportunity.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Yeah.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:55]** Because you do take attack opportunities in a vehicle, uh, but it's fine.

**[00:45:55 - 00:46:03]** So you hit the cart, the cart flies across slamming into inspector herd who takes two points of damage.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** I'm saying it's a D six of damage.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** Just slam across.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** Hey, I'll take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:11]** And it's more about sending a message.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:19]** Dude, you J-turned ghost-rid the whip almost and slammed a cart into an assailant.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:21]** That's pretty badass, man.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:24]** I gotta say, that's pretty badass.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** That's my move.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:27]** Okay.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** That's pretty awesome.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:30]** And that is your move.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** That was cool, man.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** That's pretty f***ing awesome.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:33]** Yeah.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:37]** I don't know why y'all aren't more crazy about that, because that was f***ing cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** I love that.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:43]** We've had to get creative with our impromptu escape, and I'm liking how it's been turning out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:43]** I know.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:50]** It's because I'm trying to take notes on a computer that's 14 years old.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** I mean, it's just going through puberty.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** It's fine.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** Yeah, good job!

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** It doesn't know what to do with all the hormones flooding its circuits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:02]** Do I have another action?

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** No, because I think that was your standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:08]** So you would have a... Can I open the door for Rick on the passenger side?

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:17]** Or on the now driver side?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:17]** Get in.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:18]** Hits it.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:18]** Get in.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:21]** I'd say flavor you can.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:24]** It's still going to be a move action for Rick to get in.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:26]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:29]** Because keep in mind, you have one round left before the door is closed.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:29]** Yeah, can we move?

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** You have one round left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:33]** Can I back up the vehicle a little bit more?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** You already did your move.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** You already did your move.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** You're going to be fine, though.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:42]** But your move was already the wild J-turn piloting.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:45]** Just to slam a cart in, because I think it's cool as ****.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:47]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:49]** Will, you got everything that you wanted.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** I just wanted to reverse one spoiler.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** I know you did.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** You got that.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** You got the door opening.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:57]** You got hitting Inspector Heard with a cart, man.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** You got everything you wanted, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** It's only my feet.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:02]** Dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:06]** It's only my feet.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:06]** It's fine.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:06]** Come on.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:09]** We got two points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:16]** Yeah, and you nailed doing a J-Whip on a hover vehicle in a stationary, in a pretty tightly constrained garage.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:18]** That was pretty badass already.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:34]** Alright, so there's one round left after this in which you can actually exit without having to redo the hotwire of the doors to come back up and get them to go all the way up.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** So...

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:56]** it's gnarla's turn she is going to stand up we had we had determined last time that that she was prone and uh that was you know partly a mistake but she stands up she's going to walk through the grease to herd

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** And walk past her.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:02]** She needs to roll another check because she's going to walk through grease again.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** Okay.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** Passes that.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** She's good to go.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:09]** She walks in seeing Dr. Okay.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Seeing these vehicles turned around.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:13]** Dr. Okay is ready to go.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:15]** She holds up two hands.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** I don't like it.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** One of them contains a spell gem.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:22]** You recognize that as a spell gem.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:36]** The other one starts to glow with a familiar sight as you see the blinding eyes of, or the blinding light of Magic Missile start to come up.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:42]** And she's going to cast Magic Missile on, who does she want to cast it on, Dr. K?

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:44]** Probably on Colin.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** She's going to cast it on Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** Didn't her say let Colin go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:48]** You're right.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** Thank you.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:49]** Sorry, sorry, sorry.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:53]** She's going to cast it on Dr. K.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:55]** Because yours is invisible.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:14]** She casts it on Dr. Okay, and Dr. Okay, you are going to take, as I remind myself of the damage from Magic Missile, I think it's 2d4 plus 2, right?

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:14]** Really?

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:18]** No, that and also the Doors Hit.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:26]** That's only five points of damage as these two missiles streak across the garage.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** But, well, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** The door's open and it automatically hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** I'm just curious for, like, a rules perspective.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:34]** Like, how would it hit through a completely enclosed vehicle?

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** I don't know.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** I'm not sure that's possible.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:40]** That would imply that magic missiles literally can go through f***ing, like, any, like, material.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:43]** It would imply that they're magic?

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:45]** Yes, but there are many magical things here.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Hold on a second.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:47]** I don't know.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** I'm curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** They can hit past cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:57]** I would say it would just go into another dimension through the glass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:00]** There's a million magical things they don't necessarily move through surfaces.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:05]** If I cast acid this or fireball that, it doesn't move through a wall.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:08]** I'm just wondering...

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:12]** But does Magic Missile move through a f***ing wall?

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:15]** That would make me be like... Does it move through a wall?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:21]** Maybe it shrinks down to the size of an atom to go through... Does it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** I don't know.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:22]** Let's look it up.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** I want to look it up.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:27]** I know you guys are trolling me right now.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:31]** I'm not trolling you.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** I'm just saying it's magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Look at Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:36]** I'm the one who got hit.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** In this case, we're sure it would.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:41]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:41]** Hang on.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** I found it.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:43]** Hang on.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:47]** What does unerringly mean?

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:49]** Starfinder Core Rulebook, page 271.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:57]** If a weapon spell ability or item requires an attack roll and has a range, has a line effect to be effective.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:57]** That's what it needs.

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:59]** Subject to GM discretion.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:04]** A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what an attack or ability can affect.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:16]** A line of effect is blocked by a solid barrier that can stop the effect in question, such as a wall, for most effect, but is not blocked by purely visual restrictions, such as smoke or darkness.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:42]** window is not a smoke or darkness it's also not a wall but like yeah all right cool we can we can save it for another time i would say in this case yeah my sense is in this case magic missile always hits in general that's the top reason two the door is open so there is a line of effect i was just curious in the future right so you're saying that i can now from here on out fire magic missiles through windows is what you're saying add enemies yeah

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** I said that because the door is open.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** No, I understand what you said.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:49]** I thought that was just... The door is open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** Yeah, but okay.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** But we try to be rules-based.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:52]** You did open the door.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** And I don't know if we can't flavor everything out.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** You know what I mean?

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** All right, cool.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:00]** I'm just taking a note that I can fire magic missiles through windows from now on.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** I just want to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** That's not what we're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:08]** But in this case, I think we're good to go.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** All right.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:10]** I get it.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** I agree with it working in this case for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:17]** Tensions are high in the garage.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:20]** In the garage, because now fire is being focused.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** Completely outmatched.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** You're not.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** You're fine.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:26]** The thing is, is that Hears is invisible.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** is inside a vehicle.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Rick is blocked by cover.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** Colin is inside a vehicle.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:33]** You have Sylvania and Baxter.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:35]** You have Inspector Jockshurd and Gnarla.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:37]** You all did not choose to fight.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:42]** So there's not been the slow degradation of person to person.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** It's been like, let's get the F out.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:47]** And you are almost about to get the F out if you can in the next turn.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** It's Sylvania's turn.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:56]** She looks confused for a second, seeing that you slid out of the other side of the all-terrain transport here.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:59]** And then went invisible.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:01]** And then the vehicle in front of her went invisible.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:08]** Shot up into the air by a foot as all the electricity is just discharged in a massive impulse.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Should have landed on her foot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:10]** Oh, God!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:14]** The first time she talks the entire time is when it lands on her foot.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** Actually, she doesn't even say anything.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** She just grimaces.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:21]** She is actually going to walk around, I'd say... Let's see.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:27]** She is going to move around the vehicle, and she is going to take a...

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:44]** shot at here's she has a 50% miss chance at the location that she last saw you so she's trying to move as fast as possible so she's going to take a shot there even whether you're there or not she gets a 50% miss chance that's part of that

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:53]** So she's running around the same disruptor that Baxter has, she has as well.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:59]** That's going to be a 28 to hit.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:03]** And there is a 50% miss chance.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** Let's see what it is.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:09]** Let's say above 50 she hits, below... Sorry, 50% miss chance.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:12]** Above 50 she hits, below 50 she misses.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:17]** She got a six.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:17]** Success.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:32]** As she swings around, fires the shot, and I think that you are occupying the five-foot square, but the shot lands, like, right next to your feet.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:35]** Like, she clearly, like, she doesn't know that you're there.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** She thinks that you are.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:39]** So to her, she doesn't know if you left or not.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:44]** But to you, you saw that she was very close to hitting you, and it's, like, hit right at the back of your head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:49]** He wants to react, but he stifles himself because he knows that he'll for sure give away his position.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:52]** So he's just, like, trying to keep quiet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:56]** Like, she shot exactly where you were half a second ago.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** Like, you burned out of the way for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** Yeah.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** That was...

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** You shifted, dude.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:08]** And that is not a small amount of damage.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:08]** Here's your turn.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** It's coming up in a second.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** But instead, it's crazy.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** You went invisible.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Sylvainia comes behind you.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:18]** Baxter is to your left.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** and is focused on talk.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** You're okay.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:25]** So you're like this, like I, in the middle of the storm, as you've gone invisible and they don't know where you are.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:30]** And Baxter, uh, drops the gun is going to pull out, uh, this hook sword.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:32]** And let's see.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:34]** Hmm.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:38]** They're going to move around the vehicle to where I'm assuming the door is open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:39]** Wait a second.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:40]** So that's five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:43]** Oh, this is potentially going to be problematic for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:43]** 20.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:45]** I see what 25.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:47 - 00:57:12]** yep and he's going to attack you with the hook sword doctor okay unfortunately he only gets a 14 against kac i'm sure swings it gets cracks the window just just clangs off of it just just leave some chipped glass and some spider cracks he um probably hit the uh side mirror

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:14]** He probably hit the side mirror.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:17]** It's at a weird angle now.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:27]** It's just pointing up to the ceiling, which you just see the red rays of the volcano planet coming through on the ceiling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:30]** You see objects in the mirror, maybe closer than they appear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:30]** Exactly.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:36]** And it's Baxter, who's this gnome, who's right at your eye level as you're sitting down.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:39]** Note about the temperature.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:42]** The extreme heat of Varos is starting to get to you.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:47]** Mechanically, you're okay, but you've been in here now for six rounds of combat.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** That's almost 30 seconds.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:52]** Extreme heat is 140 degrees and up.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** So you're in your armor.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:57]** I believe you put on environmental protections, but you're starting to feel it.

**[00:57:57 - 00:58:04]** All of you are starting to sweat profusely as the pressure is literally and figuratively mounting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:06]** It's getting oily in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:14]** Dr. K is... He is... He's getting all sorts of... He's schvitzing hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:26]** The community is... The wider Starfinder community debates about whether attacks of opportunity can successfully be done on invisible people or whatever.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:29]** But they definitely don't interrupt movement.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:36]** I don't think that's a bit... Well, however you rule it, he is going to not take a guarded step because he wants to get out of here as soon as possible.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:40]** So he's going to move away from Slovenia.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:45]** And then you know how he has those little mandibles that he kind of only uses for flipping people off?

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:47]** He flips her off with those.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** I mean, he is invisible.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** He doesn't want to give his position away.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:51]** But he does that as he's backing up slowly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:54]** Emotional damage!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:57]** That counts as a moral attack.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** I'm joking.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:31]** emotional damage so his full action to move towards the car and open the door and get in and that should be covered by his his full movement and that's all he's going to be able to do besides flipping Ocelania okay so she she sees the door open and sees you not entering but sees the indentation of you like moving and getting in the vehicle the seat the seat yeah yeah

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Amazing.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** I don't think that she would get an AOO from you.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:41]** So when you're invisible, just as a side note, you can't hide your sounds, your scent, your touch.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:47]** I think in this situation, given the chaotic nature of everything that's happening, I don't think that she necessarily heard you.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:49]** So that's a bit of a GM ruling.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:54]** But in general, she is unaware of your location, but she's aware of your presence.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:56]** So she knows that you're here, but she doesn't know where.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:58]** So it seems to me like...

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:21]** like it it wouldn't make sense that she would get an ao especially if she shot you and it didn't hit if it had just hit and she knew you were there exactly maybe she would agree and like um it's been established i think by colin that um that uh here's has like coconut oil on so she just smells like a faint whiff of that go away too yeah so

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:28]** All right, so it was your move action to step 15 feet away, open the door, and get in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** I don't know.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:37]** See, now I feel silly because I got this whole action economy down, but I don't know if I can also telepathically talk to... Oh, I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:39]** So he's going to telepathically talk to Rick19.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:43]** He's going to be like, Rick, just let me know I'm in the car with OK.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** So get in the one with Colin.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** And also there's this big guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** Roll a 50% miss chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:49]** Yeah.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** Or like if I'm going to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:52]** You're just going to shout it out loud and reveal your position?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:57]** Roll a 50% miss chance, Kelly Gilliam.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:00]** You roll it right now, sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:03]** Heads that succeeds or whatever.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** Heads.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:06]** Okay.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:07]** So heads.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** It's telepathic tales.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:09]** He advertised his position.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:12]** So he just like shouts it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:24]** she sees the seat like depressed just a little bit and then she hears I'm in this car not that one laughing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:30]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** Fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:38]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:43]** The shenanigans have shenanigans in this episode for sure.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:46]** This is amazing.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** It's round six.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** Sorry, round seven.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:49]** Top of round seven.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** Inspector Joshua's turn.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:58]** The doors are looking like... Well, one is jammed or was going to be in place to be jammed by Colin.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:04]** Colin, this is when you feel the door hit the vehicle and you're still outside, right?

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:07]** So there's like... Or like hit like... I thought we had two more rounds.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:08]** Nope.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** You had two more rounds.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** We just went through one of them.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:13]** This is the last round that you're able to get out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:15]** Okay, that we're able to get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:15]** Yeah, exactly.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:19]** So you feel it like it or like you see it about to be there.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:21]** Like if you backed out, you might head off the antenna.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** Like it's close.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** You know what I'm saying?

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:26]** Next round, it's going to jam on yours.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:29]** The other one is also at the same height.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:31]** It is Jock's Herd's turn.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]** Jock's Herd.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:35]** Jock's Herd is going to... I love this.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:38]** Jock's Herd just...

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:58]** smiles again that same they all have that same creepy smile and dead look in their eyes sometimes and it's one of those smiles where it's like yeah like you can't tell if they're smiling really big yeah like the movie like the smile is wider than their mouth it seems like it just oh it doesn't feel good to see that

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:03]** And then whoever's looking at him probably hears because he just got in the front seat and shouted.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:08]** You see this gun come out of his power armor.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:10]** It is mounted into his power armor.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:13]** It is a bad rifle.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:16]** He is firing it.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:22]** at... He's going to fire it at the vehicle.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:25]** He's going to try and attack the vehicle that Dr. O.K.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** adheres.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:28]** Okay.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** That hits the vehicle.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:30]** That's a 22.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:36]** Your vehicle has 50 HP and a hardness of 7.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:44]** So if I remember right, it has to, anything below seven is just going to get, like, it's going to take seven points off the top because it has to get through the hardness, right?

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:45]** So any damage.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:50]** His weapon, I really get to roll this, is a D12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** Oh, there's one D12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:54]** It's a sweet, sweet weapon.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:55]** Yeah.

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** That's 12 points of damage.

**[01:03:57 - 01:04:04]** So I will mark it for, yeah, I will mark it for now, but your vehicle has taken five points of damage.


## Speaker_0

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:09]** I heard him saying in my head, this is a 12d12.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:11]** And I was like, f***.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:15]** But that's not... 144 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:18]** We have...

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:21]** We have jumped into a level 20 campaign.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:32]** Yeah, so the electricity cycles in the vehicle as, for a brief second, everything goes black and then comes back up as the systems have taken a bit of damage.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:34]** What kind of weapon is it?

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:38]** I'll just tell you it's a static arc rifle that has the...

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:44]** Yeah, that has battle harness, which allows him to have it locked into his vehicle.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** So he doesn't need to change hands or anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:49]** Locked into his vehicle?

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:50]** Sorry.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:51]** Power armor.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:55]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** Don't give us that look.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:58]** I know.

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:00]** You said that, not me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:04]** Okay.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:06]** I'm with you, Vinny.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** I'm now with you.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** I wasn't before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:09]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:12]** Because I mistakenly said Vinny.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:14]** After everything I've given you, Will Garrett.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:17]** After everything I've let you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:18]** It's like you repay me.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:20]** Melted Man didn't go last round.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:21]** I'm going to let that go.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:26]** Shay says you probably actually you probably don't hear anything.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:28]** What's going to happen here?

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:31]** Shay's going to run in.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:35]** Let's see if he passes his check to get through the grease.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** He does.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:39]** Running in, getting the garage floor all dirty.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:44]** It's horribly dirty with wiped grease and body and blood and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:45]** Everyone says that it's dirty.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:50]** That is not Shay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:52]** Never do that again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:55]** That is not Shay at all.

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:57]** Shay's going to run in and fire at the vehicle as well.

**[01:05:57 - 01:06:01]** It's a 24 to hit with a frostbite class zero pistol.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:06]** It's going to be four more points of damage.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:07]** So it has nine points of damage.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:11]** You're at 41 HP on that vehicle.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:17]** as they are trying to take shots to slow you down or take you out.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:19]** Rick 19, your turn is coming up.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:26]** You have Inspector Hurd, Narla, and Shay standing at the door, firing at the vehicle that you have been invited to get in.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:28]** Baxter is right in front of you, sees you.

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:33]** Dr. O'Kay, you're not sure where he is, and you know Colin's in the other vehicle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:35]** Well, I know he's in the back seat.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:35]** You also heard him.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** And then he heard.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:37]** You did.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** You did.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:40]** I could smell the cocoa butter.


## Speaker_0

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:41]** Rick 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:46]** Get in the other one.

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:47]** Rick Hurd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:52]** Rick has this sense of calm after what Heard said.

**[01:06:53 - 01:07:01]** It's not that he feels invincible, but he feels like he's not being looked at by anybody, which is just weird.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:06]** And so he calmly stands up and kind of even uses his axe to pull himself up.

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:11]** And he's going to look at Baxter and say, we know that you're all Reptoids.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:15]** Why are you still wearing that silly costume?

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:19]** And then he's going to step inside of the vehicle with Colin.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:20]** Oh, he's, oh, isn't he?

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:21]** He doesn't get in Dr.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:22]** O.K.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:23]** 's vehicle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:24]** I got Dr. O.K.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** I forgot you can't even see me at all.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:27]** There's two seats in Dr.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:28]** O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:31]** 's car that are open.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:32]** One of them is occupied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:34]** I mean, you couldn't get into the car.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:36]** It's just that it's dangerous.

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:38]** You could fit in this car too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:40]** You can fit in either one.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:41]** You can fit in either one.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:46]** If you get in there, you will be moving through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:52]** Colin, Bernice, and here's... No, it's Colin and Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:57]** Colin and Bernice are in the vehicle that's out the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:58 - 01:08:00]** Rick is going to get into the one with Colin.

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:01]** Yeah, exactly.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:03]** Yeah.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:03]** Great.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:05]** Okay.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:07]** You step away, get into the one with Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:09]** Wait, so you didn't even wait for his answer?

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:11]** You were just like... Punch it, Chewie.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:12]** Yeah, why are you still wearing it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:14]** Yeah, he's just kind of looking at him.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:16]** Okay.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:18]** Colin, your turn is up.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:22]** Rick gets in looking like he went down.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:23]** He's come back up.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** He slid across the floor.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:27]** He has like scrapes across the floor.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:28]** He has oil on him.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:31]** Blood getting the seats all dirty.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** They're new.

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:34]** They have that new smell too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:38]** No cop car is that clean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:40]** It is weird because they haven't been used that much.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:43]** Anyway, Colin, what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:43]** Buckle up.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:44]** The door's about to shut.

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:47]** It's time to get out of here.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:50]** And Colin throws it into reverse.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:55]** And even though it's a hovercraft, you hear the screeching as it pulls out of the driveway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:56]** It's dragging on the bottom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:56 - 01:09:12]** It hits some debris and just leaves us as it backs up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:15]** Oh, my God.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:16]** Let's go, go, go, go.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:18]** All right, Dr. OK, it's your turn.

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:19]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:21]** I think I'm going to throw it in reverse.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:26]** You're going to hit it in reverse and back down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:33]** As Dr. OK backs out, I believe Baxter gets an AOO on the vehicle.

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:35]** Baxter's AOO on the vehicle.

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:37]** Watch him crit on the vehicle.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:38]** No, he doesn't crit on the vehicle.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:42]** Baxter gets against EAC.

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:44]** Your EAC is 17.

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:45]** Your KAC is 19.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:47]** Swings.

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:51]** And it goes right through the air where the vehicle used to be.

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:58]** As you begin to back out of tier callous base.

**[01:09:59 - 01:10:02]** All four of you are in these vehicles.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:04]** Kears is still flicking them off.

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:08]** I want to take a second.

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:16]** We see time begin to slow down for a second.

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:18]** Let's just take stock of what's happened.

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:29]** We see the arm of Colin go around to the other vehicle as his head looks back.

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:33]** And one hand is moving the vehicle, rotating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:35]** Dr. K is doing the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:38]** We see in slow motion.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:40]** We see it in slow motion.

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:48]** Here's flicking them off as the door is coming down so slowly.

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:55]** And in the background, there's just fires of lava shooting up in the air.

**[01:10:55 - 01:11:05]** We see that Shay's voice, Shay's face is just angry and smiling a smile too wide along with Gnarla's and Inspector Hurd's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:10]** We zoom in as they're trying to fire at you.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:18]** And these shots just hit the door as the door is starting to shut and go below the vehicles as you all have backed out.

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:25]** And just for a brief second, we zoom in on Inspector Heard's button that he had on his chest.

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:32]** And we see in writing written in like radially around the button, we see tear callous kill switch.

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:33]** What the f***?

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:34]** That's what he hit.

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:40]** And as you're backing out, these thoughts start to come into your brain.

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:43]** You start to think about fighting the Peritons.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:46]** You start to think about being abducted by Greys.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:48]** Meeting the stewards for the first time.

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:51]** Having these flashes of Dr. Nodens questioning you.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:53]** Sneaking around the restricted zone.

**[01:11:54 - 01:12:00]** That feeling, this somehow joyous feeling in your body when you read that the stewards are Reptoids.

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:02]** And then being chased.

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:04]** All these memories are starting to...

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:14]** Flood into your mind as you're slowly turning the vehicles around, hitting it in drive and punching it across the Veros fiery landscape.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:17]** And you feel this tingling running across your skin.

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:22]** Is that just the vibration and the movement of the cruiser?

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:32]** And the sounds of the stewards and everything that's happened quickly fade away as soon as you pull out and just give way to the smooth hum of the police cruiser.

**[01:12:32 - 01:12:39]** As you become aware of the moisture on your face, you're hypersensitive after fighting in the heat of the lava planet.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:48]** And you realize with clarity what danger you're in as you're no longer under the thumb of Grace or the stewards.

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:54]** You're stranded on the surface of a volcano moon of Brithida, and you're on your own.

**[01:12:56 - 01:12:58]** but you did level up to level six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:58 - 01:12:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:01]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:03]** Right.

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:05]** Giant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:18]** I thought for sure you were going to tell us like, as, as the vehicles like leave the garage, that like we get the sensation and then we're no longer even in the cars that we're just sitting in chairs with our brains strapped to something.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:19]** Oh my God.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:23]** Did he, did he hit a kill switch to like blow up the base?

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:25]** Oh my God.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:25]** Ah,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:29]** That seems really... Yeah, something tells me we're coming back for work.

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:32]** Okay, this is the first time we've been in the open world.

**[01:13:32 - 01:13:38]** Everything has been like a Final Fantasy game, but you can never get to go out and explore the open world.

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:39]** This, hopefully, is what this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:50]** This is a thought that I had recently that hasn't occurred to me since or before that was, we're going to the prison now?

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:55]** Where all of the people from Tarkalis base are probably held.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:13:55 - 01:13:56]** Are you?

**[01:13:56 - 01:13:59]** I thought we were going to another facility, but we could be going there.

**[01:13:59 - 01:13:59]** Are you?

**[01:13:59 - 01:14:00]** F*** you, John.

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:03]** Find out next week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:06]** I can't believe that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:07]** Good game, guys.

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:09]** That was fun.
