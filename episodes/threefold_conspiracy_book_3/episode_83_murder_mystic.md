## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:48]** My background is kind of funny.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:55]** It's like a gif of a GTR drifting on the mountains of I don't even know what.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:57]** It's hard to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:59]** Is it an R32?

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** It's an R34.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** The best one.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** The Skyline R34.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:08]** The ultimate, incredibly expensive, only right-hand drive one.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** It's dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** All-wheel drive drifting, though...

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** Isn't that kind of cheating?

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** I don't know.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** I don't really drift much.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** It's not something I like to do.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** It does look cool, though.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** He just likes the phone background.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:26]** I mean, I do it in go-karts and things.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** I do highway driving.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:30]** If it's not my vehicle, I got no problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:33]** I'm down to take y'all on go-karting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:35]** I thought we were doing that for your bachelor party.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** Yeah, we looked into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:40]** There wasn't a good karting place nearby.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:44]** The question was posed and we opted to fire large weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:46]** Guys, this is what we do.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** We'll save the go-karts.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:06]** I can go because mine's really boring because it's just a theme of a planet that Samsung gave me.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:09]** Oh, that's cool.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** It looks nice.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:00]** Serpentine.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** The lighting serpent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:10]** If I could talk more, I'm going to be selfish and talk about my car habit for a second because I feel like Vinny will enjoy it.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** I don't know.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:11]** I will also enjoy it.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** I love it.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:18]** So tonight I'm driving out to Fontana in the Z. And then I'm going to, I have a friend, Vinny.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** I'll explain in a second, Kevin.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** I just started the story.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:24]** So Vinny, I have a friend.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:33]** So I have a friend who also has a Z32, but it's a four seater.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** You know what I'm talking about?

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:39]** The two by two naturally aspirated, but he replaced that engine with his own custom twin turbo thing.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:41]** So basically that's like 312 horsepower.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** The turbos kick in really early.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:46]** So he kind of kicks my ass on like the, we've been testing it out.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** I'll just put it that way.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** So like, why do they, I don't know.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:51]** I don't know enough about it.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:51]** Okay.

**[00:10:51 - 00:11:00]** I mean, but what we're doing is like tomorrow morning, we're going to like drive up to Big Bear with the Z's and then get lunch and then drive down because the highways up to Big Bear are pretty dope, actually.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** Are you taking Waterman?

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:03]** I don't know.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** I followed him last time.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** I don't I wasn't even paying attention.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** I was just like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:10]** You were just in the flow, in the moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** I was in the driving flow.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:15]** What's the reason for going to Fontana?

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** And then there's the 330.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:20]** Because it's near San Bernardino.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** Shout out Chongzhu and Brandon and Time.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:24]** Woo!

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** What's up?

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:27]** I know that they do listen to this podcast, actually.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** I don't think we've gotten this far yet, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:31]** If you've gotten this far, hello.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:41]** The Fontana Speedway used to actually open up to the public and let people race the tracks and do things like that to try to break down on street racing.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** I don't know if they still do that.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** Oh, that's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:46]** I thought that was in Pomona.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** I'll take that down, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** Fontana Speedway is right off the 15 freeway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:52]** Vinny, do you recall that track that was at the end of Lone Star?

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:55]** Where they would race little RC cars?

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:57]** Remember that?

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:01]** And then they also raced bikes down where the playground is now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** No, I don't remember that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:09]** Yeah, it was right across from that weird little community college that was changed hands a bunch of times.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:12]** It was definitely a weird for-profit community college.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** But across from that...

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:37]** there was a track and on like uh you know saturday nights i would hear the like from like really far away and then we'd like i i i swear we went down there once and they were like riding bikes and then at one point they were doing cars it looked kind of like a velodrome one where it's like kind of ramped on the on the side well like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:41]** I've seen stuff like that in Tallahassee, but never here.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** It was right down the street from us, dude.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** Wow.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** I swear.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** I missed out on that.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:47]** I also think you've lived here longer than I have.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:47]** No.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:49]** No, no, no.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:49]** Yeah.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:49]** Where's here?

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** Like Jacksonville?

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** Jacksonville?

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** Well, I say here.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** I mean air quotes here.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:55]** Like where our parents are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** I moved to that house in 96.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** Anyway.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** So did I. Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** How do I not remember this?

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** Dude.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:06]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:06]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:12]** There's also, I might, I need to not fuck around to buy a car.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:16]** I should buy it for a car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:20]** With that, I think we should play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** We're going to form our own car club, Vinny.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:27]** It's going to be called the Kaiju Car Club, which is a lame name, by the way, but it does roll off the top.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** It's a 96.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** It's the naturally aspirated.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** It's the hard top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:51]** the slick top those are rare it's only 12k what color red what's the inside color black red and black is it cloth or leather leather oh you have the cloth is actually almost better than the leather in my opinion but this leather still i love the black well and and if i remember correctly a lot of the red ones were khaki leather

**[00:13:51 - 00:14:13]** yeah they they i think that they are actually well my friends is black leather he has the red one but uh however whatever that you're right that most of the time they're like because it does yeah john saved me from making a decision benny i'm just gonna tell you do you recall that uh scrying that you did at the beginning of the last episode i do figure out more information yeah the 25 that i rolled


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** Yeah, it was so good.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:23]** Colin actually remembers that the inside of the gray ship is black cloth, not leather.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** So it's really, really nice.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:41]** So if you can make your way inside and it's got like a super engine Naturally aspirated dude on dude It's gotta be twin turbo the way that it moves easy 20k.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:49]** No, there's no turbo lag on that car There's no turbo lag on that gray ship

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** Yeah, true, true.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:52]** Not at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** Not at all.

**[00:14:53 - 00:15:01]** Vinnie Real Talk, if you haven't seen them already, do Google the images of the cloth interiors of the Z32 because there's something about them that looks really cool.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:04]** And I've been in them before, and I almost like them more than the leather.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** Actually, I kind of do.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:10]** But with my color stuff, I'll keep it the way it is.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** I've read scenes of red leather interiors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:15]** This sounds very nice behind the recap music.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** Kelly was talking about the cloth.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:19]** I feel lifted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:22]** Like in a vehicle.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:25]** Lifted like the chunks of this gray ship that we just blasted off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:39]** Because despite not too much Starship combat experience together, on your first hit last episode, you have severely damaged the gray ship.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:47]** You are in Starship combat with this ship that stalled the Void Crier, abducted the crew.

**[00:15:48 - 00:16:02]** brainwashed some of them with mental conditioning, put you back after doing some experiments, and then went, let me just turn on the switch here, and they began to attack you, you traitors.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** Why did they do that?

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** I hate the guy.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:06]** Why are they still there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** They totally screwed up like sparkles.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:10]** They made a total douche.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:14]** I mean, it sounds like they've done a lot of f***ing around, and now they're finding out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:18]** So, you all were like, let me show you.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** I'll show you, you greys.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:26]** And you did a pretty successful about-face from some consistently good piloting from Dr. O.K.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:28]** I have to say, you've nailed all of your stunts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:32]** I mean, I came in last, but I somehow still succeeded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** Right.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** It's still good.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:37]** is to piloting as Kevin is to GMing.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** There it is.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** Wait, explain.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** It feels like Dr. O.K.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:40]** is doing better than Kevin.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:43]** I'm just like, I don't really know how to pilot.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:49]** It's been a long time since I've driven manual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:51]** Just prop the clutch.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** I thought we were going to neg Kevin, but apparently not.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** I agree, Kevin.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:59]** You were a good GM, even though we kind of wanted to kill you.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** He's still alive.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:03]** You were a good GM, except when you made more enemies and needed to be there.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** And you really did not like us.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** N plus one to Fox.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:08]** Yeah, that's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** It was not N plus one, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** That's bulls**t. Starships.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** It's N times two.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** They were cloaked.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:16]** You all were like, all right.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** It's cool.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** We got this.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:24]** We're just going to park right next to it as you scryed to find its location.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:26]** Thanks for calling Eden Moran's mysticism.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:38]** And then you pulled around, and when it finally fired, your first shot was off in the port, but it came from the starboard side.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:45]** And that's when you guys turned on the back switch and did a flyby, hitting them in the aft quadrant with two...

**[00:17:46 - 00:18:05]** shots now with that i'm going to tell you that there you saw so much happen to the ship that you know that they definitely must have taken some uh pretty severe damage enough to probably hit a critical threshold i'm just telling you guys that

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:07]** So I'm going to roll.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:11]** I'm not going to tell you what, but if you want to find out, you can try and figure out with scans.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:17]** I'm going to roll to see what type of damage you did.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** Ooh, that sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** Next one.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** Oh, please not that one.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:26]** Oh, shoot.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** What is that?

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** Oh, that's...

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** Oh, that also sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** This sounds like a lot of finding out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** Cool.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** Great.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** Love this.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** Love this.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:37]** All right.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:42]** So you all did last time a bunch of damage to the aft with a sweet flyby maneuver.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:54]** And although they did their typical wily gray ship-like maneuvering, spinning away with just an incredible amount of control, they couldn't escape your attack.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** Impressive shots.

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:11]** Thank you for that for that scream for that little home screen right there As that happens

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:19]** As they are getting hit, they fire and it seems like it would have come towards you and instead flies past you.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:25]** They miss on their shot and do not hit you all.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** Yeah.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:33]** That is the end of round two of Starship combat against between the Void Crier in one corner and the Grim Reaper.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:35]** Ray capsule in the other.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:40]** We're starting back on the map here with the Void Crier about, what do you call that?

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:46]** Seven hexes away to the right of the gray ship.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:46]** I'm going to move us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** Oh, no.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** I was going to say everyone.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:51]** Huzzah!

**[00:19:51 - 00:20:06]** congratulations great shots and and the grays totally sucked that time around doctor okay that was some great great fist bumps for everyone it's been a while but i still can you go does not fist bump you because you're wearing a workout summer

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** Kaniko, words of encouragement?

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** I mean, you are the morale officer.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** Congratulations on all your stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:14]** We have done well, all thanks to me.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:14]** Wow.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:16]** All right, Kaniko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** She's done that sometimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:18]** Here's the airlock.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** You can just leave now.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:21]** Don't ask me to roleplay an NPC, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:26]** I am messing.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** I am messing.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:28]** All right.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** It's round three.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:34]** Who is changing roles playing Hot Chairs?

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:36]** That's the game that we all played.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:36]** Yep.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:37]** Musical?

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** Hot Chairs?

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** No.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:39]** Hot Chairs.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** Hot Chairs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:42]** Hot Chairs.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:44]** But instead of hot sauce, it's heated seats.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:46]** It gets hotter and hotter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:49]** I mean, those are cozy in the right situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:57]** There's hot sauce on the seat, so when you sit down... We're going to be tempted to lick it off and it's going to be awkward and weird.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:57]** Yeah, I'm not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:00]** My mom and dad... That's a hard pass for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** Yeah, I'm not.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:01]** I'm good.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:05]** You don't want to just take some French fries you have lying around in your pocket and scoop it up and eat it?

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:07]** I mean, it's good, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** How often do you have French fries in your pocket?

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:13]** I don't know if it's the pocket fries or the butt sauce, but like...

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:15]** No.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Okay, two things.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** Best out of context quotes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:21]** I don't know if I ever told you a story about the burrito out of the pocket on a submarine.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:22]** That's a long one.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:25]** But then also, I think you guys are going to love this one.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:33]** My mom and dad bought Grayson a book for his birthday called Dragons Love Tacos.

**[00:21:33 - 00:22:01]** and spoiler the whole point of the book is that dragons love tacos but they don't like spicy salsa and the guy accidentally serves spicy salsa because it says like mild and that's why dragons breathe fire yeah dude who needs the dragons or such they can't handle fire everywhere burn down the house and then they help rebuild the fire because there's taco break and they love tacos that's a very wholesome fun well i love the book lauren doesn't like it but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:04]** All right, so who is changing roles?

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** What's going on?

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** Who is doing what?

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:09]** I don't know how I can be best helpful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:14]** I'm still going to give you guys the morale you need.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:18]** Vinny, if you... Well, I don't think scanning is going to be useful anymore, right?

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** Who's this Vinny guy?

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** I was thinking back to an old friend.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:27]** He and I had a similar interest in similar ships and stuff.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** And my screen froze.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** So just give me like one second.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:32]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:58]** hey that's it that's tough when you're trying to target a uh a weapon when in interstream freezes hey doctor you think you could do one of those flybys again might be able to finish them off yes i'll do my best as well and um i'm gonna say kaniko gives a moving speech to the whole crew


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** I don't think you can do moving speech.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** Why not?

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** Because you have to be level 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:04]** She's level 12?

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** That's right.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** No, she's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** Okay, fine.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:12]** She's going to just encourage Dr. Okay with the flyby.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:12]** Love it.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** Dr. Okay, you can do it again.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:16]** Can't you?

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:18]** I believe in you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:43]** you see colin like tightened his his seat belt and like white knuckle the controls for this net dr okay like secures his goggles because he's got to do a u-turn in order to do it he's driving goggles that's really cute actually driving driving gloves but he does it on like it's all just a tentacle


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** I like that so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** You are funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** He doesn't pull them on.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** He just kind of squishes it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:54]** Conforms to the inside of the glove.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** I can already tell this episode is going to be better than the last one.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** I feel like after a week.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** I'm sorry, the last one was kind of harsh, all right?

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:06]** It really was.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** It was harsh?

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:09]** It was just being like, how do we do anything?

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:09]** What do we do?

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:14]** Like, now we're actually, like, I feel like the success of hitting has made us happier.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** I have a question.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:17]** Yeah.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** Is it worth it to scan anymore?

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:21]** I can go back to doing science-y stuff and scan, but not really, right?

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:24]** It's only for maybe their location.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:26]** What does Hears think about that?

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:51]** here you know back when i was a captain i was just mostly known for being awesome and not necessarily particularly skilled in any one department except computers and engineering which i am good at okay and magic stuff and boarding ships but i'm not really that good of a science officer i'm trying to figure out is there anything else that we can like scan like is it worth it uh colin at this point just kind of know everything we need to know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:58]** If this growing is similar to the scan, which I think it is, there are a few things we could learn about them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:01]** So you could stay on the gun and I could scan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:03]** Right, some of that.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:09]** We could learn where they're weak.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** We could learn what weapons they've got.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:17]** We could learn about what it would take to injure the ship, though I think we might know that.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:17]** All right.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** We could learn quite a few things.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:20]** So yeah, do it.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:23]** Do it if that's what finds your fancy.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:24]** All right, cool.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:25]** I'll do that.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** I'll help you out.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:50]** so science officer can act during uh helm phase as well as the gunnery but right and right so we are in the engineering room right so the timing is like you get to choose or you get to work with the pilot to figure out when it makes sense for you to do your scan all right well uh great i'll do that

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** Question.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:58]** Is the point of a flyby that I have to go through the enemy square and out the other side?

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:01]** Or can I go through and into the enemy square?

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:04]** Because they have to move out of their enemy square anyway.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** Unless they turn in place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** Are you asking me?

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:08]** Yes.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** Sorry, can you repeat that question?

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** I was doing my engineering actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:22]** So in order to turn around and get through, I can get past them here, but I have to go down an extra one.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** You're saying?

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:31]** Yeah, the way that I read that is flyby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:36]** You're asking do you have to go through it in order to make a flyby maneuver, or can you just be next to it?

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** Can you just be next to it?

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:40]** It says you have to fly through it.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:44]** It says the goal is to fly through one enemy occupied hex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:49]** Okay, so if I turn, can I do a tighter turn than that?

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:52]** That's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:55]** Is there anything else that anybody wants to do during the engineering phase?

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:57]** Round three.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** Yes, no, maybe so.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** Okay, love it.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** Love it.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:04]** Okay, we are in the piloting phase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:11]** I don't think I can quite have the range of movement to pull off a flyby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** All right, let's see.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:13]** Let's see.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:14]** I'll try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** I'll cut us two.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:25]** Again, and I'll just try to get them lined up in front, but that's going to be based on my piloting check in general.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:25]** Okay.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** Yeah.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:33]** And in that case, because I can't move, they're just out of range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:56]** i'm going to have kanika you can do it dr okay i know you could put us in the right position and uh she's gonna roll her diplomacy for some reason every time like you do her voice it reminds me of like that muppet that like looks like uh she like sings she has like the ponytail she kind of looks like ariana grande but before i knew ariana grande was like a thing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:59]** I don't know why, even though she doesn't sound like it at all.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** It looks like Ariana Grande.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:04]** I'm not sure we're thinking the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:06]** If you look at them, they look exactly the same.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** For 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** I mean, it automatically passes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:13]** I'm afraid to Google Ariana Muppet.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** Hold on, what's her name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** No, that was for the Encourage.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** Right, right, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** Her name is Janice, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:23]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** I have not rolled my piloting, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:48]** okay yeah so you do get a plus two of your piloting check okay what do you roll let's find out let's find out does a 28 sound like something that they can maneuver around or oh i like this i like this you got a 28. you know they got


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:59]** 29 27 Let's see what they do before I Put one up there keister


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:02]** I'm not seeing the Ariana Grande.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:02]** I will show you.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** I will show you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:07]** I know exactly what you're talking about, Kelly.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** It's like earlier Ariana Grande.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** Can I screen share?

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** Is that a thing?

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** Would it show up on the podcast?

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:14]** It will.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** Let's do this later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** I will show you what I mean.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:27]** I do love that dice rolls tend to work out as they should because I have won the piling check every other round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:50]** and the round when they get hit i don't so i move first finney's face when you had a reaction uh because you you have to like disable reactions for the balloons where the balloons come from


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:50 - 00:30:15]** okay so john lost the pilot measuring contest yep that's what they say that's what they say okay uh let's see what you're gonna want to do here gray buddy i got your number you see the ship


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** Oh, man, that is just not good.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** Oh, why did I do that?

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:23]** Thank you for that more Wilhelm scream.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:24]** Okay.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:26]** You know what?

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** They are going to... Ooh.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:29]** Mm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** Your dog is eating an avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:32]** You know what?

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** Oh, is that what they do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** Do they eat the avocado?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:39]** They do eat an avocado.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:41]** What they're going to do is...

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:51]** uh they are going to move listfully to the right they're gonna run away


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:56]** They are going to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** They are going to move.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:00]** I think I know what they're going to do.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:06]** They, albeit a little, let's call it, for the first time, imperfect.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** Their maneuverability is fine.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:22]** But for the first time, imperfectly, you see the ship have to right itself as it dives under and moves down below, like to the south of you, moving its full movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** A tracking movement to the south.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:24]** They're after us now.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:25]** To run away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** Are you turning around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:29]** I am rotating.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:52]** yes i'm moving and then rotating okay so they have moved and they have uh gone through and gone down south of you to the corner of the map that we see here what do you do if i had to guess i would say that we are now in their forward arc yes we're not going to stay there for long


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:57]** I think the fastest way to turn around... Oof.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:00]** I don't want to be in their forward arc.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:03]** Flippin' bird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:03]** Our forward arc.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** What do you do?

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:10]** For what it's worth, John, you're still not pointed perfectly at a side, but that's fine.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** Put it on.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** It's fine.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** Are you in the one to the right or to the left?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:22]** So for you to be pointed... I am pointed right there.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:24]** You gotta go clockwise just a shade more.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** So how did you do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:29]** So like each side of your arc should line up with the hexes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:31]** Because you came from here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** Wait, I am so confused.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** Hold on.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** How did you turn around like that?

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:37]** You're just a few degrees counterclockwise.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:41]** Okay, what I'm seeing, unless you guys are like, let me see if I can do it.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:44]** Maybe this stays off the screen capture.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Let me show you guys right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** You moved from like right here, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:52]** I see it.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:52]** I see it.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** Hold on.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:54]** Hold on.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:57]** It's because I was going by the side of the ship.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Stop clicking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:59 - 00:32:59]** There you go.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** There we go.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** How did you do that?

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:03]** Nailed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** No, I want to know how you rotated like that.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:13]** I think it's entirely possible that the spaceship is more maneuverable than ours.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Yeah.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:16]** Is that what you're asking?

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:19]** Yeah, can you turn in place like that at the end of your movement?

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** Because you have to turn, like, while moving.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** That's, like, a rule in Starship combat.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** It's, like, why it's a paint.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** Oh, I see, I see, I see.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:32]** So you can't just, like, move and then turn, like, 60 degrees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Oh, I see.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:33]** Unless you can.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** Okay, then let me...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:46]** Unless you can, for some mechanical reason, point to, like, why, like, your a** should be, like, if you're actually going this direction, your a** should be up towards the top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:48]** Right, so let me go back.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** But you can turn.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:51]** Hold on, hold on, hold on.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:53]** Let me just make sure that I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:58]** Like, that was the whole point of me doing, like, the semicircles, because you can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:59 - 00:33:59]** Right.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:02]** So, I mean, I can either tell you or you're going to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:08]** And if you can turn, like, two hexes within one square movement still, at the end of your movement, you can only do two.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** So, basically, what?

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** Let's see.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** So, I could go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** The first step is you have to go forward.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Unless you're turning in place.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** Right.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:21]** Oh, I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** So, I can go boom.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** Boom.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:28]** It's like thinking that I, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:28]** Yeah.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** You're going to use the waypoints.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** That's why they're so important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:32]** Right.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** So then I can go to... Hold on, hold on.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:40]** Yeah, so I can go to... Let's see.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** I mean, I just... Let's see.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:45]** I want to confirm if the way that I did it works.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** Yeah.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:47]** Here.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:48]** So that's one.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** That's two.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:51]** Three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:53]** Four.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** Five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:54 - 00:35:12]** five six seven eight nine and then if i want to go to ten and i would be facing yeah i can do that so you do you have to be moving in the direction to move right so for you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:28]** Okay, so then I need to go hold on we go back to You either can turn and your range is a little shorter because you're basically you're closing that gap if you're trying to go here a direction For sure, so I can either something you have to do if you have perfect maneuverability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:38]** It's two plus two three four five six seven eight


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Eight.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** And then where was I?

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:41]** Nine.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** Was I one more?

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:44]** No, I think I was here.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** Nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:48]** You would turn one and move forward, and then turn one and move forward again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Yeah, uh-huh.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:49]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:50]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:51]** Okay.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** Right, but then... I think you'd be higher up.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:54]** So, like, you were facing this hex.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:59]** So then for you to rotate... So you're saying you can rotate, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** So you have perfect maneuverability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** That sounds right.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:03]** Okay.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** Fine by me.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** He's saying it without saying it, but I'm here for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:12]** I am not lined up right in the square, though.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:12]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Now it's there.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:23]** I'm going to try to get us on their starboard side in our forward firing arc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:24]** All right, Doctor.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:28]** As long as we're within five hexes, I think we're fine.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** Sounds good, Doc.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** Okay, and then rotate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:34]** Okay.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:37]** I have them in my forward arc, ready to fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** Are we in the helm phase?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:41]** Let's f*** them up!

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:43]** I'm going to take back one movement.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** We're in the helm phase, yes.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:45]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:50]** You are not directly aligned either, but I think I would still fall on a crack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** Break your mother's back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** That's exactly what I was thinking.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** That's a rude thing to say.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** That's why you don't do it.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:58]** Yeah, I don't do it.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:00]** This is very peculiar.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:25]** i think if you press shift it'll lock it to the thing that's fine which is how i was going to turn yeah okay i see it yeah cool cool cool all right so yeah wait i appreciate it good piloting oh sorry oh no i'm sorry i don't know if we're moving on yet so i i want to like do a scan real quick hold up hold tight for one second uh here we go is it oh is it a quick scan in the minor action


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** It's science officers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:29]** I don't know if it's minor action or not.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** It's just their regular thing.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:30]** Yeah.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:30]** Okay.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Home phase.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:31]** Okay.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** Are we in the home phase?

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:33]** Yes.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:33]** Yes.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** Okay.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** So it's DC5.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:36]** Okay.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** This is what I need help with.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** I'm sorry.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** DC5 plus 1.5 EST.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:40]** Okay, cool.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** So what am I doing?

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:43]** I'm just rolling something.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** No, you're rolling your computer.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** Oh, I'm not doing anything.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:45]** Okay.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** It's a computer check.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** All right.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:50]** Let's see if my computers are up to snuff for this.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** This is my first time doing it.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** 16.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:58]** It's not the best, but let me see if I can figure something out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** Okay.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Probably not.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:03]** You are able to get basic information from me.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:05]** We already have basic information from you.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:07]** You didn't, you had their location.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** Colin Edenbrand chose their location with the mysticism roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** Got some info.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** What do I, let's see what do we got here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:23]** Okay, so with that, you get the basic information, which I believe gives you a lot of cool stuff.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** And that is... Where is scan?

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** Here it is.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:31]** Okay, there are four crew members aboard.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** Four greys.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:35]** Four crew members aboard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** Four crew members aboard.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:40]** Could be greys, could be a mix, could not be greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:41]** Yeah.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:45]** So, like, I just watched Saw again recently because the new one's about to come out.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:49]** And, like, the way the jigsaw killer was, like...

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:54]** Using his captives in layers to, like, test all the way down.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:57]** I would not put it past the greys for these two.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** Oh, me neither.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** Nor this AP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** Yeah, but it looks like they're in a saucer, which would be a grey ship.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:04]** They wouldn't give a grey ship to... Come on, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:06]** You know better than to make assumptions like that.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:06]** Right.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** We don't know anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** That's a gross assumption.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** Rick doesn't know s*** about aliens.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:14]** You know s*** about these aliens...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:35]** um it looks like their ship is a flying hold on i got i got some more information everyone shut up all right there's more information coming in all right so there's four living creatures on it what else yeah it it's a small shuttle small shuttle yeah all right cool okay so it's not a saucer but that's just our icon that we're using right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:58]** that's the ship classification no it's a saucer it's technically a small shuttle classification you are right rick that it is a saucer but it's a shuttle all right shuttle saucer i i said disc but saucer sounds like you're more that is the more technical term yeah and yes they have speed 10 and they have maneuverability perfect maneuverability which makes sense for a saucer


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:02]** I already devised that, but thank you for that info.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** Well, if I get another scan.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Well, I might be able to learn some more later.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:15]** Yeah, if you do another scan, you'll get your AC, TL, current hull points, shield points, all that good stuff.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:17]** Thanks.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:18]** Nice.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** Good piloting check.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** I like it.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:27]** Okay, it is now going to be the next phase.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:29]** Good piloting round.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:29]** Thank you, Dr.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:32]** O.K., for keeping me honest on the movement.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:37]** And Foundry is shouting at me for literally no reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:41]** So you're not showing your arcs, but I'm assuming that we're both tracing the line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** It's good to have the arcs, actually.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:47]** Yeah, you are both tracing the front arc line.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** Ooh, this is cool.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** This is cool, actually.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** Head to head.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** I like this.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:53]** Okay.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:57]** It's the gunnery phase!

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** Let's find out what happens.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** All right.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** The ships are nearly head to head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** You guys have it.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** They're dead in our sights.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:07]** Colin, I am finding a range of less than five hexes.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:10]** You should be able to attack them with the heavy laser net.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:13]** I'm giving it all she's got, Captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:17]** Make sure you use that heavy laser cannon, Rick.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:20]** Do some murdering of those butt.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:24]** Murder of those butts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:27]** Let's see if Colin can out-murder Kevin this time around.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** I mean, Rick.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** Did the coin fail you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** I flipped it like four times.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** I just kept missing it.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** The final time I caught it.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** Guys, guys, guys.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:37]** You got a natural 20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** It's a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:40]** Oh, my God.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:44]** Oh, my God.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:46]** This is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** What did you get, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:52]** I got a total of 11, so I just right past them with the heavy laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** They might not have.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** It might be 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:55 - 00:42:02]** So, John, in the event of a natural 20 in starship combat,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:07]** You do critical... It does the... You don't get to double your damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** Double damage seems obtuse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Yeah, no.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** You will pass a critical threshold.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** No matter what damage you do.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** Is that true?

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Is that it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** There's no extra damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** That, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:26]** If we would have already crossed a critical threshold, do you cross two critical thresholds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** So, critical hit, attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** Sorry.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:40]** Critical success, critical hit, attack, 20 on a D20, and damage dealt to ship's hull or damage exceeds one of the five critical thresholds.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** Is that a choice?

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:44]** That was from your thing.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** We go to damage here.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** Don't say it's mine.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** Critical damage.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:56]** Critical damage is scored whenever gunnery check results in a natural 20 on the die and damage is dealt to the ship's hull.

**[00:42:56 - 00:43:02]** The critical range is expanded to a natural 19 or 20 on the die, but yada yada.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:23]** but i think that that's an important distinction so damage to the ship's hold meaning we break through the shields no it's saying that if you do break through the shields you will and you got a natural 20 no matter what that like even if you don't pass the critical threshold which is different for every ship you will still hit one of the uh gotcha systems yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:51]** yeah so basically it's saying so he's got if he has full shields and let's say they're 14 and you do 16 damage it wouldn't ordinarily be enough to do a critical threshold but because it's a critical it is it hits that critical threshold so precisely he'll do that glitch or whatever it is right that he rolls but if you don't do more than the shield damage then it it's just a hit it's a good thing it's with that laser can't right net


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Heavy net laser.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** Yeah, it's bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:55]** It could be six or it could be five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:55]** Sure.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:56]** It could be six.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** Five.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:57]** It could be five.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** It could be five.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:04]** All right, I mean, you know they already took some critical damage now.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Why don't you go ahead and roll your damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:07]** Am I?

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** You just said that.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** Did I?

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:09]** You didn't.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** It's forward slash, not backslash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:13]** Sorry, I used the wrong slash.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:13]** Oops.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:17]** That is 20 electric net damage.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** To which arc?

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** Forward.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:19]** To the forward arc.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** This is good.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** This is good.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:24]** Well, I guess I get to choose forward or side.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** You can say forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:49]** we're kind of on the forward or uh star let's go forward okay since you already did it 20 damage to the forward arc and then uh and then okay sounds good that makes sense they will take critical damage i'm gonna uh i'm gonna see which system that affects which system is left and that's after taking critical damage last round too

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:52]** And cool.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:54]** Okay.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** All right.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** Love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** I know we shouldn't curse.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** Love that journey for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Love it.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:02]** I know we shouldn't curse, but yeah.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:02]** Yeah, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** We do all the time.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:08]** Whatever language those grays are speaking in, I'm sure they're cursing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:11]** So Rick19, you missed, right?

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Is that what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:12]** I think.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** Does 11 hit?

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:15]** 11 does not hit.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** Even now that it's critically destroyed?

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:20]** It all happens simultaneously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** Critical system doesn't affect AC.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** Yeah, there's a damage phase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:30]** You crush through and clearly deal some damage to the front arc.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:33]** There's burns across the front of the ship.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:43]** The otherwise, you know, almost mirror-like aspect of the saucer is now besmirched with your weaponry.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:48]** Like just a hit on the dignity of these greys.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:52]** And as that happens, they were firing.

**[00:45:52 - 00:46:01]** And again, the laser just starts firing as yours is firing and was about to hit you.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:04]** And then because of the shot, they're knocked off and they just miss you.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** Literally just miss you and don't hit you.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** Nice.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** Nicely done.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** Nicely done.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** Anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** We've got them where we want them.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:16]** You really do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** You really do.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** Good round three.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:22]** Chuck one up for the murder mystic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:27]** That was great, Colin.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:27]** That was great.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** Love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** Top around four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:31]** I'm actually really scared that that's going to stick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** Murder mystic?

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** The murder mystic.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** The murder healer?

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:37]** Yeah.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:39]** I will heal you by murdering you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:44]** Because that's kind of where my cleric ended up in D&D anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:45]** It's true.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:48]** How many more rounds can we go?

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:50]** We are in top around four.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Chance to change roles here.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:53]** Anybody want to do anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:59]** I think we're doing it all right.

**[00:46:59 - 00:46:59]** What do you think?

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** Can he go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** Yes.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:03]** Let's do it.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** Let's end this.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** Wow.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:06]** Okay.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** We are in an engineering phase.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:10]** Who wants to do what?

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Anybody?

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:14]** I don't think we have any engineers, do we?

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** Is that we're doing an engineering thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:20]** I thought that was what Kelly was doing.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** I'm doing science.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** Oh, right.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:23]** Sorry.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:27]** Can you act in science during the engineering phase?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** No, it's only helm and gunnery, it says.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** Okay.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:33]** Magic officer works in engineering phase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:36]** He does, except your magic officer is currently operating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:43]** There's also not much you can really do in engineering that's of value, in my opinion, for this particular moment in time for us.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:47]** We don't really need a different auxiliary power to hold it together at this moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:54]** Yeah, I mean, if he knows, if the greys know to hit us on our starboard...

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:56]** which I'm going to hopefully avoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:56 - 00:48:00]** Well, I'm just saying, yeah, right now we're not in danger.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:03]** This might be too early to have to do anything.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** But yes, you're right.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:07]** If that happens, then we definitely need an engineer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:13]** There's like engineering or if there were like multiple ships, we would have to probably hold it together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** Let's hope that does not happen.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** If Kevin was a GM, it would happen.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** But with John and Compton.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** N plus one saucers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** Yeah.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** Hey, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:22]** Wow.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** That was a good dig at Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:31]** But I will say that you are kind of like, I feel like you're like, you're not actually level one, but this is your first Starship combat, so, you know.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:32]** We'll see.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** There's plenty of room.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** We're still on tutorial island.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:42]** I would love to have some dope, like, I mean, it would be a lot of work, but we could do some, like, fleet, some squads and stuff.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:44]** A lot of ships, a lot of things going on.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:44]** Could be cool.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** Maybe some interplanet atmosphere or something.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** If Kevin's GM again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:49]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:49 - 00:49:11]** i'm just he would have like little fox piloting like little tiny ufos and they could just be like and there would literally be space comments too yeah i mean i thought we were gonna do starship combat because you know we're space pirates i know i like built my character with like all kinds of ranks and diplomacy to do like anyways


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:15]** We're space pirates, but we just spend our entire time in a desert wasteland.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** That's like what we do.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:20]** I also spent rank in diplomacy, and then I kicked somebody over.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** So, you know, that's how.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:24]** Tomei had a plus 22 for piloting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:29]** That is a... You should have let him know.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:33]** You should have been like, I'm real sorry, but probably not going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:40]** I can just imagine the K'Fox and Little Wiener mobiles moving through the Starship combat map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:43]** It's ironic because they're in K'Fox dog mobiles of all things.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** It'd be like really weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:48]** Amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** Good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** Go check out Unknown Treasures if you haven't.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:52]** Yeah.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:56]** And tell your friends it's a good place to start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** Start with Unknown Treasures.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:59]** Chronologically, it's the beginning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:03]** Alright, it's piling check time, Dr. O.K.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** Let's get going.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** I think I'll try to encourage you again, Dr.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:08]** O.K., if that makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** Does anyone disagree?

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** Does anyone want a boost?

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** Alright.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** I like being encouraged.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:41]** I was looking at maybe um maintenance access panel uh allows an acrobatics check to basically supplement engineers but you're saying you're not going to use divert power but you could divert power to give more damage to the weapons oh it's if the engineer successfully does it then I think this is a lot of the chief would boost it so this is something that we should have talked about beforehand right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:41 - 00:51:08]** when that was the engineering phase yeah maybe there's one around five who knows yes that's what okay that's why she's interjecting i was too busy reading everything reading what exactly uh the starship guy how to use a forward laser cannon console um so she rolls a 25 so she assists so dr okay gets a plus two on his piloting check

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Nice.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Okay.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** Let's... Here we go.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** Here we go.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:15]** What'd you get?

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** 14.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:19]** 14 total?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** That is correct.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:22]** Ouch.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:23]** All right.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:26]** Yeah, they got a 34.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** Jeez.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:31]** Well done.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:56]** maybe you got caught up in the moment in the in the the brouhaha yeah i was like oh yeah we got them and then you shot and then you know they're like on the edge and they've got like it's cool they've got us beat this round maybe i try to do another flyby oh doctor i think that's a great idea copy that i'm ready are we in the helm face yeah we are scanning


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:00]** It's here's eating his pocket fries.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:05]** Off the hot sauce off the chair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:10]** Y'all were playing hot chairs, so there's some sauce on your butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** Inferno.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** All right.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:28]** I made a 24 for I don't know who's going first, but I scanned with a 24 Wait, so you're scanning right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** No, you can well, whatever I can help face


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:58]** yeah that's not hell though is it yeah it's home oh it's the same as piloting it's held it yes the same as piloting okay yeah yeah yeah all right i scanned them okay so you got 24 correct just like last time right no last time i got less than that that was like sorry yeah just like uh more is good more info more is good yeah okay uh you are able to determine a couple things one

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:04]** They are currently, their AC and their target lock are both at 18.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** AC and target lock at 18.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** Taking note of that.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** They have 40 hull points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** 40 hull points.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:14]** Right now they're at 16.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:14]** They're pretty damaged.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:16]** They're 16 out of 40.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:19]** Pretty close to being taken down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:23]** In their forward quadrant, they have 14 shield points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Forward quadrant, 14 shield points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Port and starboard.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** Port and starboard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:27]** 15.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** 15.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Aft, 7.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** Aft, 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:32]** Yep.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:32]** Yep.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:36]** And PCU value is 134 out of 140.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:38]** PCU value, what does that mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** I don't know what PCU is.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** It's your power.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:46]** Yeah, so when you're building starships or upgrading, there's a limit because of the frame and how much your ship can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:48]** So they quantify that with PCU.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** What critical effects they're suffering?

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** I'm going to say...

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** Well, so that was defenses.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** Okay, that was defenses, guys.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:57]** Weapons.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** It only has one weapon.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** One weapon alone.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:01]** Particle.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:02]** Particle.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Light particle beam.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** Light particle beam.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:04]** Forward arc.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Kind of lame.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:07]** Oh, it's only in the forward arc?

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** It's only in the forward arc.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** I guess that's why it's so maneuverable.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** Especially their weak back there.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:15]** If at all possible from the aft.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:19]** You know, it doesn't say where the critical threshold is.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:45]** That kind of falls under the other which is the last level I will tell you that you know that they have multiple systems that are glitching and You can tell just from just from like looking and and and confirm with the with the scan that right now Let's see which one I'm gonna roll to see which one I tell you they have multiple and a roll to see which one and

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:48]** There... Which one is that one?

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:53]** Whichever one affects... Which one is that one?

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:53]** The sensors.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:58]** The sensors system is glitching, which affects all science officer actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** Sensors system glitching, so good shots.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:03]** Their science officers can't be very useful.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:05]** And they have several others that are glitching.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:09]** Lots of them are glitching systems, but can't quite identify them at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** Yeah.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** All right.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** Dr. K, what are you doing?

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** Good stuff here.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** Good scan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:18]** All right.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** Let's try this.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:25]** I think it's, you know, it's a calculated risk, and I'll say it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:29]** Hopefully I'm not bad at math this time.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** Oof.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:34]** That's an eight on my check.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:35]** Woof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:36]** Wait, what?

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:39]** So I was trying to do a flyby.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:40]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:47]** So I'm going to just put us through their square.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:50]** And they get an extra attack, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** Yeah, they get an attack on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Okay.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:58]** But also, do you have to stop once you get through them, or can you keep going?

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** Yeah, what's the deal on that?

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** I don't think you have to stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:03]** Because you do a normal movement, but they get a free action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:05]** Oh, so it's just a normal movement?

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** Yeah.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:07]** Okay.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:07]** Okay.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:14]** Okay, so you move, and I will get an attack on you.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:17]** I'll do it during the gunnery phase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:24]** So let me just make sure that I plot correctly my movement.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** Do I need to roll for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** I do, right?

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:30]** Yeah, you definitely need to roll.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:30]** Okay.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** Okay, cool.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** I will handle that then.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** I'll know that I get another attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:50]** Yeah, if you fail this check, your starship still moves as described above, but you follow the normal rules for attacking based on your starship's final position and distance, and the movement provokes a free attack from that starship as... Alright, so what I'm doing...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:51 - 00:57:12]** as i'm moving through the um ships square it's only like four hexes away and i'm using the rest of my movement to do an arc to put us put them in our forward firing arc okay and so it would end up right next door wow right next door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:37]** i love that so under under um moving through other starships it says if an a starship moves through a hex containing an enemy ship the enemy starship can fire any one direct fire weapon that's key not for this instance but just like in the future yeah yeah from any arc at the moving ship targeting the aft quadrant so you have to target our aft


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:39]** Okay.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:39]** Okay.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:39]** Yep.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:41]** So that free attack targets your aft.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:45]** It doesn't account for any bonuses or abilities from any other actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:48]** So it's just a straight gunnery check like I would normally have.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:49]** Okay.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** Cool.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** Love it.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:52]** Good stuff.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:52]** Okay.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** So the Okada's five happens.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** I mean, I don't know if you saw it on Foundry.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:59]** That was a sweet, like, spin around.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:01]** I feel like you drifted around me.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** Feel like you drifted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:05]** Yeah, I was I was piloting the Z right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:05]** Oh, hell.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:16]** Yeah 100% 100% you were just like Chicken space dust some some drift drift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** Mmm.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:17]** That's good.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:19]** I like that Like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:26]** All right Square drift drift that won't be the title but it could be squared just great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:26]** Oh

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:30]** Alright, so I get to move.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:30]** Yeah.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:38]** I need to... So I'm going to do this slowly just so I can do this correctly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** Yeah, you can move anywhere you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:42]** Right, but I just don't want to... No, no, no.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:44]** Yeah, but I still want to get it right.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:55]** So I'm going to move because I basically want to move back and then I can move one and then... So I was there.

**[00:58:56 - 00:59:03]** i do like the idea that i can move like down across one two three four okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:32]** one other thing about moving through another starship space is that if you don't have a designated gunner you cannot take that attack that free attack so just saying again I don't think it applies here but just putting thoughts and heads right but I can fire any right if there was nobody in the gunner position for me that I could do that right you'd have to have that was six yep

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** That was six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** They got us outmaneuvered.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:41]** Hopefully they miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** Yeah, I'll have two attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:44]** I don't see our arcs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:48]** I turned them off just to make it easier for me to move mine because I knew that I was going to take a little while to move mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:53]** I kind of love the idea of, like, the greys just flexing on them.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** Just, like, doing donuts at every turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:59]** I mean, that's why I'm trying to move a lot around you.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:05]** Just, like, and very quickly just, like, from, like, one big swath to another big swath.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:08]** Yeah, I definitely agree.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:30]** could i have i could that was seven and then if i move if i had moved eight then that would have been there okay so so that so that's where i moved i still could have turned okay so that's where i'm at now so that was eight hexes over and i turned and rotated pretty much each time yeah they're still within range of our starboard lasers


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:32]** Yeah, we're weak on that side.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** Okay.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:39]** But the flyby opportunity shot has to hit the aft.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:43]** So we're okay there, sort of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:52]** So they basically... So Dr. K did a Yui, and then I imagine that the ship kind of did... You did another Yui.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:56]** Yeah, just like spun and dived down and then came back around.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:56]** It's a dogfight.

**[01:00:56 - 01:01:24]** dude it is a dog fight oh i love it i love it i love it all right that's the end of the piling phase unless i think uh keniko already went here's already went we're just in some gunnery firing now let's let's get it going so question yeah as a gunner am i a gunner or am i manning the turn wait what i think yeah i think you're a gunner but it doesn't only technically you can run you can


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:48]** i think storyline we're saying that you're actually in the turret but like the gunner can operate any weapon right so like mechanically am i restricted to just the turret or could i operate the other starboard and then you would do turret because you have the mystic ability otherwise you'd be using your i don't think you can find the same weapon we're out of range of the turret


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:55]** Well, I just rolled terribly, so that's up to John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:59]** And since there appears to be two starboard weapons.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** There does?

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:02]** Two light particle beams from what I can see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:04]** No, there's only one starboard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:04]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** One port and one starboard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:06]** Cool.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:06]** Yep, never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:10]** This round's a dud.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:12]** Let's hope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:17]** I rolled a 5 on the die for a total of 14 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:20]** You know that their AC is 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:21]** Right, so a hit.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:22]** Perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** Yeah, definitely.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:24]** 100% hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** All right, Rick.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:29]** We need to get those rookie numbers up, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:30]** I'm working on it.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:36]** That's 13 damage from the light particle beam in your aft.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** Against your aft quadrant.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:38]** Right in the aft.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:41]** Right in the aft, baby.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:43]** That should be the title.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:46]** Kelly's.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:50]** And then six to your starboard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:56]** We've lost our shields on the starboard side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:56 - 01:03:00]** Oh, you got some hold damage Yeah, how do I apply a whole damage?

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:01]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:04]** You just take off you click on haul and drop it.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:07]** Yeah Wow, dude Okay.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:10]** Well, you know what at least they got your haul and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** At least they got your hole.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:14]** I can shift shields if needs be.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:14]** Just let me know.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** Might be a good idea.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:18]** Where do you need it shifted to?

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:19]** I can't see too well.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:20]** What's up?

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:21]** I can't see the systems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:22]** Nothing on the starboard side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:24]** We got seven on the aft.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:27]** I'll take care of the starboard side, I guess, then later.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:28]** Sound good?

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:29]** So there's two things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:32]** Well, you can balance the whole thing, can't you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:32]** Right.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:37]** So we can divert power to the shields, which will give it replenish shields.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:45]** And or you can rebalance shields where you take the total and then equally distribute it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:48]** All right.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:49]** Or you can move points from one to the other.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:51]** It's a top of round five.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** Both, if we can.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:55]** So maybe glide and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:56 - 01:04:21]** okay let's go i need your opinion the uh am i more valuable trying to fire on the string from within five hexes or should i uh i don't know i think we might need to uh keep our distance this round should i scry some only some some new information about the enemy ship uh i mean so i'm just looking at glide


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:26]** Distance between turns is plus two.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:29]** And we want to... And we can only move five?

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:31]** Move half your movement, right?

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:33]** Okay.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:34]** I believe so.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:39]** Well, I kind of want... Can we... We can't decide that before... Piloting.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:40]** Piloting, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:41]** Yeah, so we're at the top.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:44]** So if you all want to change roles, now is the time to change roles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:49]** You could also use precognition to give plus two to pilot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:49]** Yeah.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:51]** And I can have...

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:53]** What's it gonna be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:54 - 01:05:00]** Well, okay, I think... Yeah, I mean, it was basically like, should I do something?

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** Other than shoot.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:02]** Other than shoot.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:04]** Like, are we gonna be with five hexes or not?

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:05]** Probably not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:09]** If I'm also doing...

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:19]** like if I'm doing the engineering phase and in order to Complete that I have to either Give a pilot.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:21]** Oh, I could have Caneco pilot.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:24]** You could have Caneco pilot That's probably better.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:24]** Can you go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:27]** Can you jump on the stick real quick?

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:32]** I've uh I'm gonna keep I'm gonna try and keep this Together here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:34]** So do I plus one for piloting?


## Speaker_0

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:35]** Oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** Yeah.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:37]** She's got a plus one.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:38]** So that's what we'll do.

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:40]** And then I'll do the engineering phase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:43]** It's just a plus one, but it's also our full movement instead of half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:43]** Yeah.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:45]** Yeah, I like that better.


## Speaker_0

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:45]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:47]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:50]** Okay, so Kaniko's taking piloting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:55]** I put in a macro for a couple of the Okada's maneuvers for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:57]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:00]** Since I'm playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:01]** I'm still playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:06]** It looks like we're going to be outside of the range.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:08]** Let me see what I can find.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:09]** Scrying something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:13]** I'll try to keep us in the forward arc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:17]** Best I can Just make sure they don't get behind us.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:19]** It's Kate.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:21]** There's no way I can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:30]** Maybe I don't know So then I have to like yeah, I know what to do Okay Okay, so it's the engineering face.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:31]** All right.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:34]** So do I want to divert?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:50]** And so you get to choose whether it's speed, science officer bonus, in which case we're doing... If you send it to the shields, you restore an amount of shield points equal to 5% of the PCU rating of the starship's power core.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:52]** And you distribute it.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:53]** Okay.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:57]** You can distribute restored shield points across the shields to four quadrants as you see fit.

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:02]** So 5% of 240.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:03]** What's your power for?

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:04]** It's not 200.

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:06]** It's subtract like 100 from it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:11]** Our PCU says 247.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:13]** So it'd be 147?

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:13]** Yeah.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:16]** Which means what then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:22]** That you can restore 5% of whatever 147 is to whatever shield.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:24]** 5% of 147?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:24]** Yeah.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:29]** So you get seven shield points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:30]** Seven shield points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:33]** That'll do something.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:34]** That's for sure.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:37]** Okay, here goes nothing.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:42]** What?

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:43]** 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:46]** That might pass.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:48]** What's the DC?

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:53]** Yeah, it's 10 plus one and a half times our ships.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:57]** Okay, so it's actually one less.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:57 - 01:08:00]** 10 plus?

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:03]** Yeah, it should be 17.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:05]** So you don't.

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:08]** Yikes.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:08]** Close.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:09]** Very close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:10]** Sound face.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:11]** I'm asking again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:14]** No, this is the engineering face.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:16]** It's a good try.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:17]** It's a good try, doctor.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:18]** Okay.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:21]** This is your first time going into the engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:24]** So hang on before we move on.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:25]** Yep.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:26]** Yep.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:30]** I'm going to scry some additional information about the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:32]** Okay, I'm just going to tell you so you don't waste turns.

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:41]** That would mean that you would get more about the systems, essentially, if you nailed it.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:48]** Otherwise, you get the load, like the expansion bays and any cargo that might be carrying, and then anything else.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:50]** So I don't know how important that is to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:54]** I'm really curious to find out the rest of the systems that we've impacted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:55]** Okay, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:56 - 01:08:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:58]** Scry.

**[01:08:58 - 01:08:59]** Scry away, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:02]** Um, not great.

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:07]** That's an eight on the die for 23.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:09]** That's actually pretty good.

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:11]** That got us a lot less.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:11]** Yeah, no.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:13]** Yeah, that did.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:17]** That actually gets you enough to know that they...

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:20]** Okay, so they had, ooh, this is good.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:24]** The science or sensors were glitching, right?

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:31]** Then you went through and you also saw that life support is glitching.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:34]** So that's all captain's actions.

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:39]** You see that the weapons array was glitching, but they just were able to patch it up.

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:40]** So it's not glitching anymore.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:41]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:47]** I understand that they are constantly attacking us, but I am having doubts.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:55]** What if the ship is manned by people that are under the influence of the greys, but they are innocent lives?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:59]** That's a possible outcome.

**[01:09:59 - 01:10:07]** However, from what I've seen since waking up in that bush, I think these greys are doing their own dirty work.

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:11]** Rick, do you remember?

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:12]** Yeah, we've encountered them in person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:17]** We were aboard the ship in the visions that Colin had with Grace.

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:23]** I imagine it fits, but... Additionally... Who can say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:24]** I can see...

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:33]** through Satan Ray's grace that the life support systems are in disarray based on what we've done so far.

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:40]** We can also see that the weapon system was damaged, but they've been able to repair it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:10:40 - 01:11:05]** i think another critical hit might uh damage that system beyond repair maybe get news indeed uh john um could one figure out through the biological signatures their exact species shut up can i figure out what species they are

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:06]** Well, that's a good question.

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:11]** So I saw these things in my computer signals Maybe I could do another skill to like interpret it or I you know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:14]** Yeah, I don't want you to waste an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:29]** Well, yeah, I mean Just you know, Rick is getting all soft on us somehow and I think I think Okay, give me a check Kev gives a disapproving look but still hasn't killed anything.

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:30]** Well, I

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:46]** All right, what am I rolling it's the same as a scan So I'll just say it cuz you're yeah, you didn't already go right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:48]** No, it's a 28 Wow.

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:49]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:50]** I

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:51]** Yeah, that's really good.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:52]** Is this just for flavor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:53]** Are we actually doing this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:58]** I was going to say that you can just look through the data because y'all have done a lot of scans and scrying.

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:01]** It was more that you're just looking through.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:03]** I don't want you to waste your action.

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:06]** You are fairly confident that they're all grays.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:15]** All right, Rick, listen, I looked through the data and I'm just telling you, the signatures are telling me that they're very, very likely grays.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:18]** All right, so you can relax and fire away.

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:20]** And I don't know, maybe you'll get a shot at this time.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:21]** Who knows?

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:23]** But just don't worry, okay?

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:25]** We're not killing anyone in this set.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:30]** He doesn't say anything, but like, he just, he's, I don't know if any of you noticed, but he's nodding.

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:32]** He's just like, almost like an acceptance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:35]** Like he's, like he's, all right, cool.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:37]** I'm actually going to like kill him.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:38]** What do you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:39]** It's, it's, I think it's worse than that.

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:42]** It's like these, these angers have f***ed with us.

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:43]** All right, cool.

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:44]** I like that.

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:45]** So it's a deterrent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:46]** Kermit nod.

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:47]** Okay.

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:48]** He's like, all right.

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:50]** He's got tighter on the gun.

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:52]** He kind of shivers a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:53]** He's like, oof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:55]** You still got your hand on my shoulder?

**[01:12:56 - 01:12:57]** He just clenches it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:01]** Take it easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:03]** When are you acting science officer?

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:05]** Cause we're at the end of the pilot.

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:06]** Oh, now we're in help.

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:08]** We're in piloting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:09]** It's the same thing.

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:09]** Apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:10]** Oh, you're right.

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:10]** You're right.

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:11]** I'm so sorry.

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:11]** I'm so sorry.

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:11]** I'm so sorry.

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:12]** My bad.

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:12]** My bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:14]** Wait, I thought they were the same face.

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:16]** You said they were the same face.

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:17]** No, we are just going into piloting now.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:18]** Oh, okay.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:18]** All right.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:20]** Well, I have something ready for when we do.

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:21]** There you go.

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:22]** For what?

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:23]** Now that we're in help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:24]** We are going in help.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:25]** Yep.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:25]** Okay.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:26]** Dope.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:29]** Kaniko's going to roll her piloting check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:30]** Okay.

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:53]** okay guys uh let's see how this it's it's been a while since i've piloted anything and it was it was on autopilot the whole time so 19 on the dive for a 20. wow they got higher than you yeah there was a 37

**[01:13:53 - 01:13:55]** They rolled a 47.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:55 - 01:14:00]** They are f***ing trained for this, but Koneko knocked it out of the park, though.

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:02]** John, does it start with a 3?

**[01:14:02 - 01:14:05]** I'm not going to say anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:11]** Wait, aren't crits in Starship Combat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:13]** Oh yeah, 19 or 20, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:17]** No, that was an action to turn them into 19 or 20.

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:21]** There's like a stunt or there's a thing that you can do to make them 19 or 20, but it's not.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:24]** But there are crits if you roll a natural 20 on most of these.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:26]** On the cheat sheet, it says what they are.

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:28]** Sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:29]** Okay, so I gotta move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:29 - 01:14:31]** What are you doing?

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:35]** I think I should just try to stay as far away from them as possible.

**[01:14:36 - 01:14:41]** since we don't have the element of maneuverability on our favor.

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:42]** That's a great idea.

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:43]** She's all of a sudden an expert.

**[01:14:45 - 01:14:48]** I'm going to take one out of your book, Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:48 - 01:14:50]** All right.

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:51]** No, I don't.

**[01:14:51 - 01:14:52]** Can I cancel that waypoint?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:52]** There we go.

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:54]** The Okada's maneuver number seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:56]** Okada's nine.

**[01:14:57 - 01:14:58]** A little bit of tea.

**[01:14:58 - 01:15:00]** These are the tales of the starship Okada's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:09]** They're just inking all over the hallways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:09]** Just like a bunch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:11]** Yeah.

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:14]** Okada's number nine is a strong alt.

**[01:15:14 - 01:15:34]** title for this yeah it's a strong alt title to this yes absolutely oh you went away dude you're out of here wow yeah we're hella let me out she hit the nose man yep oh yeah okay during those nine second lap times

**[01:15:35 - 01:15:38]** She lives her life a quarter mile at a time.

**[01:15:39 - 01:15:39]** Quarter mile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:41]** Sorry, not lap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:43]** Ten hexes at a time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:15:43 - 01:15:44]** Ten hexes at a time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:47 - 01:15:49]** I had to redo my foundry, but okay, makes sense.

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:55]** I had to restart my foundry because it just decided to be like, nope, I'm gonna not do anything for you, buddy.

**[01:15:55 - 01:15:57]** Yeah, no, hard pass.

**[01:15:57 - 01:15:58]** Okay.

**[01:15:58 - 01:15:58]** Alrighty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:15:59 - 01:16:03]** Without family, you've got nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:29]** yeah for sure i can't i just can't i can't at all oh my god oh my god oh my god okay all right all right they're gonna go here uh they're gonna go actually they're gonna turn and go you gotta go and then turn just like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:48]** well i can turn steel so i wasn't paying attention so i missed kaniko's movement she flew away and then back around yeah basically yeah okay copy that try again after that one jesus


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:50 - 01:17:01]** And they basically move to the very edge of your starboard arc and they turn to put you in their forward arc.

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:12]** Still on your staying like you all sent to just shift it up They know a good round when they see one and you never lined up right John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:15]** Oh Sorry, you're off just a little bit.

**[01:17:16 - 01:17:17]** It's okay.

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:17]** I see.

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:18]** Thanks Kev.

**[01:17:18 - 01:17:23]** Okay They appear to be in our starboard arc, but I they have us in their full track.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:29]** Hmm So I think we got a rebound what else you want to do in your home face?

**[01:17:30 - 01:17:32]** I mean, there's nothing I can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:33 - 01:17:36]** Keniko's, I did the best I could.

**[01:17:36 - 01:17:37]** What about the science?

**[01:17:38 - 01:17:39]** Yeah, Keniko did a good job.

**[01:17:39 - 01:17:39]** What about Kelly?

**[01:17:40 - 01:17:41]** What about Science Officer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:45]** Kelly, here is going to balance the shields.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:45 - 01:17:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:17:46 - 01:17:50]** All right, I'm going to balance the shields equally, I think is probably advisable.

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:50]** Is that correct?

**[01:17:51 - 01:17:53]** I don't have the read-offs.

**[01:17:54 - 01:17:55]** Should I do an equal shift?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:56 - 01:17:59]** They are currently on our starboard side.

**[01:17:59 - 01:18:03]** You may want to more heavily weight that side for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:18:03 - 01:18:07]** I think our starboard side was the one that was out of shields earlier.

**[01:18:07 - 01:18:07]** Is that right?

**[01:18:08 - 01:18:09]** That sounds right to me.

**[01:18:09 - 01:18:10]** Is that right?

**[01:18:10 - 01:18:11]** All right, cool.

**[01:18:11 - 01:18:14]** I'm going to shift shields to starboard.

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:16]** Balancing coal.

**[01:18:17 - 01:18:21]** Running the check right now.

**[01:18:22 - 01:18:23]** All right, let's take a look here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:26]** So do you need to know what our shields are?

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:28]** Zero in Starfield.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:32]** So if you're going to do just a balance, it would go 13 to each.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:18:33 - 01:18:34]** We're not going to do that, though.

**[01:18:35 - 01:18:36]** First of all, I rolled a 15.

**[01:18:36 - 01:18:37]** I'm not sure if that's enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:38 - 01:18:42]** It's 10 plus 1.5 times your ship's tier.

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:44]** So it's not enough to balance it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:18:45 - 01:18:47]** Sorry, guys, I couldn't do it this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:48 - 01:18:50]** Hopefully I can take them out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:18:50 - 01:18:51]** This is the worst.

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:53 - 01:18:56]** Feeling a lot like that time we played with Finder.

**[01:18:57 - 01:18:57]** Oh, no.

**[01:18:59 - 01:19:00]** Come on, flip die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:01 - 01:19:02]** All right, flip die.

**[01:19:02 - 01:19:05]** We are moving into the gunnery phase.

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:08]** I could do another action in the gunnery phase, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:08 - 01:19:09]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:19:09 - 01:19:11]** Just one action for the entire time.

**[01:19:11 - 01:19:11]** Ten hexes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:12 - 01:19:13]** That was a terrible flip.

**[01:19:13 - 01:19:14]** I'm so bad at flipping.

**[01:19:14 - 01:19:15]** There it goes.

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:18]** 16 on the die.

**[01:19:18 - 01:19:19]** 16, okay.

**[01:19:20 - 01:19:22]** So that's plus 9 is 25.

**[01:19:22 - 01:19:25]** Yeah, that's a hit.

**[01:19:25 - 01:19:26]** Yes, Rick, good job.

**[01:19:27 - 01:19:28]** In their forward arc.

**[01:19:29 - 01:19:30]** Their forward arc or starboard?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:30 - 01:19:32]** No, on their forward arc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:32 - 01:19:34]** On their forward arc.

**[01:19:34 - 01:19:36]** Our starboard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:19:36 - 01:19:39]** Our starboard side is facing their forward side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:39 - 01:19:42]** I was hoping we'd get forward art because it's 4d8 versus 3d6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:19:44 - 01:19:45]** They're aft as fuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:46 - 01:19:47]** Next time I'll do my best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:48 - 01:19:49]** That's a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:50 - 01:19:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:53 - 01:19:55]** Two for seven.

**[01:19:55 - 01:20:00]** And a four for 11 points of damage.

**[01:20:00 - 01:20:00]** Ooh, okay.

**[01:20:00 - 01:20:01]** Yeah, okay, good.

**[01:20:01 - 01:20:01]** Nice.

**[01:20:02 - 01:20:03]** Target locked.

**[01:20:03 - 01:20:03]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:04 - 01:20:04]** Contact.

**[01:20:04 - 01:20:07]** It doesn't even get through their shield zone, or what were their shields at?

**[01:20:07 - 01:20:09]** We don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:09 - 01:20:11]** You would have to scan again to find out.

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:14]** They do 12 damage to your starboard arc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:16]** 12 damage to the hole.

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:18]** 12 damages to the hole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:18 - 01:20:20]** That puts us below a critical threshold, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:21 - 01:20:22]** No, actually, it doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:23]** Oh, nice.

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:25]** Critical threshold is 13.

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:29]** Right, it's 13 from max.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:29 - 01:20:31]** Are you 13 below max?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:32 - 01:20:35]** Is it 13 below max or is it 13 in a single instance?

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:37]** It's every 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:37 - 01:20:39]** Okay.

**[01:20:40 - 01:20:44]** So we had three points go through before we were at 62.

**[01:20:44 - 01:20:46]** Yeah, it is.

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:47]** So we're at 50.

**[01:20:49 - 01:20:51]** And that puts us through a critical threshold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:52 - 01:20:53]** Let me just double check that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:55]** It was fun while it lasted, gents.

**[01:20:57 - 01:20:59]** This is turning a little tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:59 - 01:21:00]** It's turning a little tough out of the blue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:00 - 01:21:02]** We're supposed to talk about critical thresholds on here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:04 - 01:21:09]** So you roll a D100, and I can just tell you which... Whoever.

**[01:21:10 - 01:21:10]** Whoever wants to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:12 - 01:21:19]** Critical damage is also scored whenever the target starship's hull takes damage that causes its total amount of damage to exceed its critical threshold.

**[01:21:19 - 01:21:21]** or a multiple of that threshold.

**[01:21:21 - 01:21:31]** For example, a starship with 100 whole points and a critical threshold of 20 takes critical damage each time its total amounts of whole points of damage exceeds 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 points, and so on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:32 - 01:21:32]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:33 - 01:21:34]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:34 - 01:21:34]** What page is that?

**[01:21:34 - 01:21:35]** What are you looking at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:35 - 01:21:36]** Page 321.

**[01:21:36 - 01:21:38]** Under critical damage.

**[01:21:38 - 01:21:39]** Second paragraph.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:39 - 01:21:39]** Yep.

**[01:21:39 - 01:21:41]** So who wants to roll a D100?

**[01:21:42 - 01:21:43]** Who wants to roll a D100?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:21:43 - 01:21:45]** Anyone can, just for the walls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:45 - 01:21:46]** Benny's doing it.

**[01:21:46 - 01:21:48]** I was going to pull out my fancy D100 die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:21:48 - 01:21:49]** No.

**[01:21:49 - 01:21:50]** I don't trust that die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:50 - 01:21:53]** It's the really nice sounding metal dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:55 - 01:21:55]** All right.

**[01:21:55 - 01:21:56]** What do you want?

**[01:21:57 - 01:21:58]** What number am I looking for?

**[01:21:58 - 01:21:59]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:00 - 01:22:00]** A good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:00 - 01:22:00]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:01 - 01:22:02]** They all are.

**[01:22:02 - 01:22:03]** Give me a good number.

**[01:22:03 - 01:22:04]** Probably not engines.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:04 - 01:22:06]** Probably not engines.

**[01:22:07 - 01:22:08]** Give me no engines.

**[01:22:08 - 01:22:09]** 84.

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:09]** 84.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:11]** You are close to engines.

**[01:22:11 - 01:22:12]** You're at power core.

**[01:22:12 - 01:22:14]** Oh, fuck.

**[01:22:14 - 01:22:16]** Your power core is glitching.

**[01:22:16 - 01:22:21]** All engineer actions now have a minus two, except for there are some exceptions.

**[01:22:21 - 01:22:22]** Hold it together and patch.


## Speaker_0

**[01:22:24 - 01:22:24]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:24 - 01:22:26]** How does that play out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:22:27 - 01:22:47]** Dr. Okay is currently in the engineering console, and so he sees, like, steam and, like, smoke just sort of start glitching, and it's like on Star Trek where, you know, they take, like, serious hull damage, and, like, he's just sort of blown back a little bit.

**[01:22:47 - 01:22:50]** Oh, we should do it for the camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:22:50 - 01:22:53]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:22:53 - 01:22:54]** Give it a roll.

**[01:22:54 - 01:22:55]** She's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:22:55 - 01:22:58]** Oh, my God.

**[01:22:58 - 01:23:00]** We're getting on the bridge.

**[01:23:00 - 01:23:01]** We're like, whoa.

**[01:23:02 - 01:23:02]** Steady.

**[01:23:02 - 01:23:02]** Steady.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:23:03 - 01:23:04]** Just rocked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:23:05 - 01:23:05]** Amazing.

**[01:23:05 - 01:23:06]** Just rocked.

**[01:23:07 - 01:23:08]** You know what?

**[01:23:08 - 01:23:08]** To the core.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:23:10 - 01:23:12]** Rocked to the core.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:23:12 - 01:23:13]** That's our game.


## Speaker_0

**[01:23:13 - 01:23:14]** Fuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:23:14 - 01:23:16]** Totally changed now.

**[01:23:16 - 01:23:18]** Totally changed now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:23:18 - 01:23:20]** The momentum has positively shifted.

**[01:23:20 - 01:23:21]** Wait, hey.

**[01:23:21 - 01:23:21]** What?

**[01:23:21 - 01:23:27]** Before we go, I really do want to show you why I think that she looks like Ariana Grande.

**[01:23:27 - 01:23:27]** What?

**[01:23:27 - 01:23:29]** Is this going to be recorded?

**[01:23:29 - 01:23:30]** This is the loser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:23:30 - 01:23:30]** All right.

**[01:23:30 - 01:23:31]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:23:31 - 01:23:32]** Do I just screen share?

**[01:23:32 - 01:23:33]** Is that what I do?

**[01:23:33 - 01:23:33]** Sure.

**[01:23:33 - 01:23:33]** All right.

**[01:23:33 - 01:23:34]** Yeah.

**[01:23:34 - 01:23:35]** I mean, this is going to show up.

**[01:23:35 - 01:23:35]** All right.

**[01:23:35 - 01:23:36]** Cool.

**[01:23:37 - 01:23:38]** Entire screen.

**[01:23:39 - 01:23:39]** All right.

**[01:23:39 - 01:23:40]** Okay, see this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:23:41 - 01:24:01]** Oh my god This is exactly what happens


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:24:01 - 01:24:04]** And this is Janice.

**[01:24:04 - 01:24:05]** They have the same eyelashes.

**[01:24:05 - 01:24:06]** I'm telling you.

**[01:24:06 - 01:24:07]** Ariana Grande.

**[01:24:08 - 01:24:10]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:24:12 - 01:24:13]** It's the same person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:24:13 - 01:24:15]** Curate.

**[01:24:15 - 01:24:17]** It didn't take long because it's so easy.

**[01:24:17 - 01:24:18]** It's the same person.

**[01:24:18 - 01:24:19]** Oh, my God.

**[01:24:20 - 01:24:21]** Oh, my God.
