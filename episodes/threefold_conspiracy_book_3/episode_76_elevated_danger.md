**[00:00:00 - 00:00:20]** Previously on Willsave...

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:36]** Tor's tempestuous axe takes aim at Rick in a devastating blow, but not before the doctor makes an unanticipated observation revealing an enigmatic element of the android's armor, surveying a subtle shift in the severity of the subsequent strike.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:43]** Will their diverse dexterities be decisive in crafting a cosmic crescendo of coalescing triumph?

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:48]** Or are they blindly barreling towards an abyss of apocalyptic adversity?

**[00:00:48 - 00:00:53]** Find out this time on Will Save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:35]** You have come to the right time at the right place.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:41]** This is We'll Save the Podcast coming to you again at another We'll Save Wednesday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:42]** We'll save.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:42]** We'll save.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:44]** Happy Wednesday, everyone.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Happy Wednesday.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:49]** I am John Swan, your GM knocking down doors.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** And it is Wednesday, my dudes.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:56]** And I want to ask Vinny, what should you drink?

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** What does everyone think Vinny should drink?

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** What's in your cup, Vinny?

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** What's in my cup right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:04]** In my cup right now is Kirkland Signature Orange Seltzer.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** I don't hate it.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:07]** It's actually not terrible.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** It's terrible out of the can.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:09]** Can looks dubious.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** This is the thing.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:19]** And I'm annoyed because, you know, a certain GM of ours is celebrating his nuptials very soon.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:26]** We all gathered in Nashville and had some stuff made for the kosher sausage king of California.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:28]** Amazing koozie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:32]** And I can't use the koozie because it's terrible.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:34]** There's too much carbonation out of the can.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** So I've got to pour it in a cup.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** But if I pour it in a cup, I don't get to use the koozie.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** It's, you know, trade-offs.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:50]** So it's either that or I've got some 1800 tequila passion fruit pre-made margarita that I bought.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** It is a lot of words.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** I bought this probably six months ago.

**[00:02:53 - 00:03:02]** And as you can see, still unopened because I had a Bacardi Mai Tai something or other that was actually really tasty that I finally finished today.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:14]** So, as I like to enjoy a beverage to yes and a little more efficiently, what do I drink, gentlemen?

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** I think you should roll.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:42]** think i should roll oh yeah yeah do a shack style wisdom check so is this like straight up even odds or do i like a natural 20 is the elijah craig barrel proof absolutely and a one is like water no what's your worst alcohol in your closet in your bar dude uh the worst did i bring the kavasi back home

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:43]** I think I did.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** God, I'm bougie.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** My courvoisier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** Did I bring the courvoisier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** I think... Darling!

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:57]** Did I put that swill in my shelf?

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:59]** Actually, no, I've got some... Is it still in the speedboat?

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:08]** My neighbor is... He's a great guy, but he gifted me this... I love when you get gifted... Decanter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** ...kind of just random...

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:28]** alcohol stuff he gifted me this dope oh man it's like gorgeous yeah it's like a mic stand i feel like that should that belongs in like a 80s movie yeah it's straight up or something yeah or like the boss of the evil corporation drinks that right as they poison somebody


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:32]** And it's got some Johnny Walker black in it, but he's also, like, a cigar smoker.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:37]** And so it tastes a bit like cigar smoke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** That's definitely a natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:44]** I don't know if you guys enjoy scotch, but, like, Johnny Walker's already really smoky.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:48]** And so, like, all that additional smoke is just way too much for me.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** That's the natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** Is it really that smoky now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:59]** I don't typically have some Ardberg.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:07]** And then I think the natural 20 would be probably another roll because I've got some blue.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:10]** I've got some harmony collection that I really like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** Yeah, let's roll a d20 and see what number it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:14]** Let's find out.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** Let's find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:18]** Yeah, I mean, you haven't established what's in between, but sure.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** Right.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:20]** I mean, we'll let you be the judge of that.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:24]** It's an eight, so let's go.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** It's an eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** I feel like that's seltzer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:27]** All right.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:31]** That's seltzer with a little extra, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:32]** Okay.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** What's the extra, bro?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:36]** I've got some Western Suns vodka that I might just like.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** Toss in?

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:37]** Just toss in.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** Okay.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:38]** Yeah.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:39]** I think that's the play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** Okay.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** All right.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** Well done to a nice move.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:47]** Question is, what is in Kelly's cup that he's sipping vertically?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:53]** I have some good old... Yeah.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** Dihydrogen oxide or whatever the fuck is it.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:56]** Dihydrogen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** I did that because Vinny was off screen.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** Hopefully you didn't hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:05]** I got this also from... He's giving me a look like he heard it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:06]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** You got that water from Nashville?

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Yeah, I brought it all the way back.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** Along with this cup.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** Thank you, John.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:12]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:12]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** Of course, buddy.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** Good stuff.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:16]** Go to water.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** I don't keep alcohol in my home.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:18]** I probably should, though.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** Like, it'd be kind of nice to have every now and again.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:21]** Yeah.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** I'm not trying to say you have a problem, Vinny.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** I just need a... I do need to have some alcohol.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** You do have a... I have the problem of no alcohol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:30]** A shack just full of liquor hidden in your backyard.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:37]** I'm glad that we just talked about just like straight alcohol for like, this has been like at least five minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:42]** This is the most alcohol heavy show we've probably ever done.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** This is well, like, I don't know.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:48]** It's like, oh, wait a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:53]** I think it's important to, to, I, I have to ask myself that question every so often.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:56]** Like I've got so much, so many bottles around me.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:59]** That's like, do I have a problem or don't I have a problem?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:01]** It depends how much you drink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:09]** And I think the litmus for me is would I have all of these bottles still if I had a problem?

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:13]** I was talking about that tequila that I bought six months ago.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:19]** I've got bottles up there that I bought two years ago, some that were gifted longer than that, like

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:24]** It takes me a long time to get through a bottle of liquor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:34]** I mean, when we were recording in person, I had the fridge, the beer fridge, with just a cornucopia of... That was great.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** It was an amazing fridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:35 - 00:08:04]** modern times and craft beer and yeah the sours the sours the sours were good ooh I love a sour yeah but it still has like a bunch of like imperial stouts just chilling there yeah that's because you stopped drinking right pretty much chilling I had some soju here until recently now it's gone and uh now I have nothing it's alright we'll all drink together soon yeah yay that's the other part I'll pick us something for a future I guess


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:11]** I love having, like, really nice high-end stuff on the shelf for special occasions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** You know, when I pulled up to L.A.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:18]** for John's engagement party, and the four of us were going to be together.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:18]** Sorry, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** Well, the cork incident, the cork night.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** Yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:26]** Pulled up with, like, two really nice bottles of bourbon.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:29]** Did the same thing when we got to Nashville.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** And, like...

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:39]** If I was to go to the store and get that instead of just having it, that would be a whole lot of money all at once.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:48]** But I'd rather just collect it in my own time and then I can use part of my collection to celebrate with you fine gentlemen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:53]** That's a really heartwarming... That rooftop bourbon was quite good in Nashville.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** That was also quite good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:55 - 00:09:00]** That was Blaine's gold for anybody who wants to posthumously join us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:05]** All right, well, let's crush this heartwarming moment and go back to the game.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** Does that sound good?

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:06]** Should we play?

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:07]** Let's do it.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:08]** Let's play.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** Let's just get out of here.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:16]** Heartwarming collection of everybody coming together.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:18]** And I love that Benny just walked off.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** That was the wrong drop.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:22]** Yeah, I was like, okay, well, that's cool.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:22]** That's good.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** I was putting it back in the fridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** Here we go.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** Uh-huh.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:27]** Yeah, yeah, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:29]** That was the right drop.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:34]** Here we go.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:36]** Creepy times aboard the Void Crier.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:44]** As right as you decide to face the greys in starship combat.

**[00:09:44 - 00:10:10]** Then there is a strange, creepy scream from everyone on the bridge as Shay and Narla drop unconscious, and three of the Pykesperitons turn around, and I need to make a drop where it's three different people screaming, and then they come into the same unison note, and then shuts off, and they turn around, smiling, and attack.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** And you take them out.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** Because you're like, you know what?

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:17]** Maybe they just haven't eaten.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Maybe they're bloodsucking or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** They need a Snickers bar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:23]** There's no excuse for being a dick.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** You're not you when you're hungry.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:27]** That's all I'm trying to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:33]** I mean, you did roll a check to see what could make them not unconscious.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:36]** It's okay.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:41]** And after you swiftly dispatch with them non-lethally, there's a

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:47]** voice over the intercom saying, I need your help.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:51]** Has anybody not gone totally homicidal aboard this ship?

**[00:10:52 - 00:11:10]** It is the voice of Kaniko Breeze, one of the Pyke's Paratons, who was sustained pretty heavy damage during the assault on Outpost Omicron and has been in the med bay asking for help as Torv and as you come to find out Ludovia

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:17]** Knocking down the door, trying to sell them some vacuums and then take her out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:20]** Classic one-two combo.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:23]** Maybe they've been reaching out about their car's extended warranty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:28]** I really think they're going door to door through the ship to sell encyclopedias.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** That's what I think they're trying to do.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** Classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** That's what the Greys are up to.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** They're just, you know, selling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:40]** They're wondering if they've had their knives sharpened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** Knives sharpened.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:47]** Maybe they want to sell some, you know, solar energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** Your starship.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:51]** Solar energy rips.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:55]** Would you like some nuclear power for this, sir?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** No, that's the problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** They don't want nuclear power.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** That's exactly it.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** She said, hey, Rick19, you must believe in nuclear power.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** Help me because they don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** Save me from these guys.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:11]** That's all they've talked about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:14]** They keep saying that nuclear power is not sustainable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:19]** That's actually Kevin's superhero alter ego.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:23]** Little do you guys know, Rick has a nuclear fusion heart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:30]** We're all going to die just being around Rick.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** I know, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** For more reasons than we originally thought.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** There are Geiger counters around here.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** I don't know what to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** That's fine.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:36]** That's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** So you all are like, all right, cool.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:39]** I feel that.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** Let me come help.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** Come down.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:47]** They see you as Colin gracefully knocks over a bunch of tools.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:53]** And you all enter into combat.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:57]** We're still in the first round of combat, and I'm going to bring you guys back to the Void Cryer.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:01]** You are spread out among the lounge.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:08]** Torv has charged in after Rick19 shot Torv, and Dr. OK threw a grenade that didn't.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:13]** Its effect did not pierce the programming that Ludvija and Torv have.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:17]** And I'm going to bring us back to the battle music.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:22]** We just ended Torv's turn where Torv hit Torv.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:30]** Rick 19 and Rick's body responded in a strange, strange fashion.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:37]** That is the end of Torv Gray Crag's turn standing in front of you in the dark in some pretty dope.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:49]** I'm going to say Rick 19, some excellently crafted freebooter armor that Torv has with some, the metal looks to be exquisitely made and,

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:51]** Colin, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:53 - 00:14:02]** Colin is going to take a step down in order to get a better look at Torv.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** Okay.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:08]** And he's going to try to yeet Torv's mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** Yo.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** What do I need to roll?

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** What's going on here?

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** Walk me through it.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:16]** Yeet my mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:17]** So we'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:18]** So we'll save.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** We'll save.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:22]** Versus a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:25]** So basically.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Oh, shit.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** This is dark.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** So Colin's going to take.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:33]** He takes Torv's mind remotely in his hand.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:37]** And just like you see him start to move.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:47]** manipulate it massage it and he's he's using his hypnotic abilities to bring torf back to the gray abduction


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:51]** We're in the middle of combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:51 - 00:15:01]** You're going... But instead of him having a conversation with the greys, he's going to force him to feel every bit of pain from them changing his eye hardware.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** That's what he's going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** Is this lethally or non-lethally?

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** Can you cast this non-lethally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** I don't think I can cast it non-lethally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** I don't think you can either, sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** I think Torv is going to get f***ed up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Torv is dead.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** Yeah, I think you might.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:15]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:15]** Yep.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** DC 16.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:18]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** Against the spell?

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** Against the spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:27]** As you're massaging, you feel a force start to just push back against your will.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:31]** As Torv rolled a 24 against that.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:31]** Wow.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:37]** I rolled well, and he has a bonus to saves against spells, but still.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:40]** I think he... What's that roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:41]** Stand by just a moment.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** I mean, I'm still going to roll damage.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:43]** You just take half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:44]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** Yeah.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** Is this mind thrust, by the way?

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** I didn't hear you say it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** Yes.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** Yes, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** Okay.

**[00:15:50 - 00:16:00]** You hear Torv like as Rick, as you see the eye closing and opening and Torv's face is scrunching in pain and anger.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:01]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:04]** So he takes seven damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:04]** Yo.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:05]** All right.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** If you could just not, that'd be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** Yep.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:10]** And then Colin is going to scoot right back behind Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:12]** Ooh, can you move cast move?

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:12]** Yes, he can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** He has that feat.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** We talked about this last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:16]** We did talk about that feat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** Agile casting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:20]** Look at you being all agile, being like, whoop, whoop, whoop.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** I remember I called him out hard on it, and he was like, nah, ah, ah, ah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:24]** Oh, okay.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:27]** So when Colin does it, you don't get for it.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** But when Thaddeus does it, there's lots of shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** No, I gave him for it, and he has a feat.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:33]** He's got the feat that makes him a scrum master.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:35]** No, I'm just saying.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** Like, I agree with your tactics, Vinny.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:37]** That's all I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Thank you.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** It's a good thing to do.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:44]** He took the two-hour online course and got certified scrum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** All right, Bill Dress.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Let's all sit down.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:58]** I mean, look, if he went into the nearby engine room at the very back and then cast it, then maybe he would be learning from this Thaddeus school of tactics, right?

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** That's got it.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:02]** That would be even smarter.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** Speaking of, here's Kelly.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** Where are you retreating to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:12]** Here's is already in a little bit out of danger, as you can see.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:16]** So he's going to do... Electrovor's still out, by the way.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** Electrovor didn't go anywhere.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** He's been following him around this whole time.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:19]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** Never called him back.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:24]** I need to get you an Electrovor icon.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:27]** Now, the...

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** This is a Vesk, right?

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:30]** Ludvija?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:33]** Ludvija is a Vesk, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** Ludvija is further down that hallway.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:37]** I remember seeing her, right?

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:39]** Like kind of where Torv was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:43]** Yes, Ludvija is right near Torv, still at the door.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** Where is Electrovor?

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:49]** Electrovor is just basically chilling with yours on his shoulder.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** Okay.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** So she's through.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:55]** I remember her being, like, basically at the door that they were trying to break down earlier, right?

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** Yeah.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:56]** Okay, cool.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:01]** Then here tells Electrovor, Electrovor, go around there and act really cute and innocent.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** You know, do what you normally do.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** But then you want to do an electrical discharge.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** So...

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:11]** You know, Electrovor hops off and starts skittering over very, very adorably, by the way.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** And then he comes around the corner.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:14]** Ludvig has never seen an Electrovor.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:16]** You should be able to move Electrovor on Foundry.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:19]** Oh, is it this ghost looking thing?

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:20]** Cool.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** Dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:24]** And I know you're going to hate me, Kelly, but how long does Electra 4 last for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** A while.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:28]** It's like... I thought it was only like one minute.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** No, that's not at all the case.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:30]** Give me like a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** That's not at all the case.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:36]** Don't you even try to pull that, Kev, says Judge Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:39]** I thought it was like a max of one minute per day or something like that.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** Hold on, hold on, hold on.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:40]** What was it called?

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:41]** Statue of something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** That's a good question.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:46]** Statue of Lim Electrobor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** Okay.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:50]** Should we start our two-minute timer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:51]** Yes, we should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:52]** Done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** Hit the timer, Vinny!

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:56]** But then what do we default to?

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** That's the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:00]** One minute, because I'm...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** What's it gonna be?

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:05]** What's it gonna be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:10]** I feel like the two minutes you can't distract them with Jeopardy music.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** Sorry.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:13]** Or Price is Right music.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:18]** It has to be an unadulterated two minutes.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:19]** Cool.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** And honest to God.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:22]** You're on the clock.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** I think we should just be quiet.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:30]** We'll just leave the audio silent with just music for two minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** Two minutes of dead air.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:33]** I got nothing.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** John, what is it?

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** It's called a statue of what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** It's called a statue.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:42]** It's called Figuring of Wondrous Power, and there's an electrical one specifically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:45]** Yes, I know exactly what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:52]** You can be a creature for up to one minute per day though.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:58]** This duration does not need to be used continuously after the figure has been in creature form for one minute or versus figurine form.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:58]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:02]** So I know I'm calling you out on that, but I'm also sick.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:08]** Like I think that, you know, you could do flavor wise and electrical was like on your shoulder or something.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:14]** But like you you would just like call it back and throw it again, and so you only waste one round with it, right?

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:14]** Exactly.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:17]** It was only one round before so nine more rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:17]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:18]** You're fine.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** So if you want to cast it now.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** I'm sorry, Kelly.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** I'm sorry for bursting your bubble.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** No, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** With the rules.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** We need the rules, people.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** We need you.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:26]** Yeah.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** Yeah, we do.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** All right.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:28]** Good lord.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** So you're going to cast it.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:34]** So, yeah, here's recast Electrovor.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:38]** So he throws him off his shoulder, which, you know, adds a little bit of complexity.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:41]** Because now I have to roll a d20, which I will roll to see if it lands.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** And I want it to land.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:43]** You're fine, dude.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** All right, cool.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:48]** So here's throws the Electrovor, and it lands next to the hallway.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:50]** Right in front of the hallway.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:54]** Right in front of the hallway, because he probably can't throw it around the corner like that.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:55]** So there it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:56]** I mean...

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:07]** I would rule that you get cover from trying to... That's my thought, is that you'd probably get cover and you'd increase your chance of not hitting that square if you wanted to try and throw it around the corner.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** Like, into the hallway.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** You want to try it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:09]** Sure.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:15]** Well, I mean, he could also see the corner of that square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:16]** Right.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:19]** If we're talking about throwing a weapon.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** Yeah, it's him...

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:23]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:29]** I guess if you're targeting the corner, you could just try and throw it right into the square that's right by the door, right?

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:35]** Because we were saying you might have cover, but if you're going to target the corner that you can see, then you can try and do that if you want to land it inside the square.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:36]** Do you want to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** How would I get any cover?

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** Because, like, it would be right in front of the vest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** You wouldn't get any cover.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:43]** Scrap what I said before about cover.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** It's fine.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:48]** I agree with Wool's assertion that you can see the corner, you're targeting the corner, so you should be able to hit the corner.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:50]** So it should be AC5 if you want to hit it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:54]** I feel like Electrovor can attack on it when it's being thrown based on our history.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:57]** I mean, if you're targeting, you're throwing for the vest, right?

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:59]** The vest is one square past the door.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** Well, two squares past the door, I guess, technically, how you...

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:05]** So if you were to aim for the door, you have a clear shot on that.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:09]** And then it would land right in the corner.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** It can hit either way.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** Which one do you want to do?

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** Just roll.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** I rolled a 13.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** Okay.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** You're fine.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:18]** Cool.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:18]** You're there.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** Wherever you want to be.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** It doesn't actually.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** Inside the door.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** No, no, no.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:22]** He's going to stay.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** He's going to stay on the outside of the door.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:24]** Okay.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** Because he wants to stay a little bit further back.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:29]** And then he's going to roll a. Yeah.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** Because this is an AOE.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** All right.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:35]** So he's going to roll an electrical discharge.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** A-O-H-F-2.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** Five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** Attack of his frickin' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:42]** Now, if I... Is there any save for that?

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** Or what's the roll for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Yes, I'm getting into that right now.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:52]** A target can attempt a DC-13 reflex save to take half his damage and be standard effective if they... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** Wow, they rolled a natural one.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:56]** Does something special happen?

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:01]** Not on a failure for... The Vesk has indeed never seen an Electrovor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:07]** So you just see the cutest, bluest, possible Pikachu-looking thing.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** And its eyes are so friendly, you know what I mean?

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:13]** They're really big and buggy and beautiful.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** And it's like, meow.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:17]** And then it goes like, and then, yeah.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** Awesome.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** And then she takes six damage.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** And she's staggered.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:20]** Six?

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** Five?

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:21]** Five?

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** Five damage or six?

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** You said five, right?

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** Five damage and they're staggered for one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** Staggered?

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** Yo, could you just not?

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** That would be great.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:31]** What is staggered again?

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** S-taggered?

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** Let's find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:42]** I always imagine from Punch Out Boxing on the NES, Glass Joe's animation when he's like getting knocked down.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:44]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** When a character is staggered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** You can either take a single move or standard reaction.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** He's round and you can't take both.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** You can take a single or standard action.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** You can't take reactions.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:55]** And you cannot take a full action either.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** You can't take a full action.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** Pretty, pretty dope.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** That's dope.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:00]** Nice.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** That's awesome.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:02]** It's something.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:04]** It is indeed something.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:06]** Is that the rest of your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** Here's has basically thrown something.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:11]** So that was like a move action, I guess.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** I think that was a standard action.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** It's a standard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:15]** Probably move action you can pull it out, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:15]** Yeah.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** All right, fine.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:17]** Then I guess that's all he can do.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:23]** I guess he's probably going to move like close to Meltaman and see if he can on the next round, like maybe hack him to do something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** That's it.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:26]** Well, if you were pulling it out, that's a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** But he could move.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** He's got a BAB plus one, so he could pull it out while he's moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:30]** And throw.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:31]** Yep, sounds good.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** Cool.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** So you step forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** See, I'm on your side, Kelly.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** I'm your teammate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:40]** You toss like a comical joker.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** You just whoop.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** You alley-oop like a globetrotter.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:44]** Whoo.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:59]** and the figurine over, lands in front, and Electrovor's pops up, and Ludvaia's like, and she's looking at the beautiful eyes of this creature, and then gets zapped as the Electrovor pulls a fast one.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** Good turn.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:04]** Five points of damage, and guess whose turn it is.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:06]** It's Ludvaia's turn.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:12]** Shocked, she is going to fire at


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** The Electivore.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** Sorry, Electivore is basically immortal.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:17]** Even if he goes down, he'll be all right.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:25]** Just take him to a Pokemon center and heal him, so it's all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:26]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** All right.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:33]** Ooh, that is a 21 to hit.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:35]** Yeah, that'll hit.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** Okay, that'll hit.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:47]** So it's going to be nine points of fire damage to Electrovor from this Rotolaser as Luvaia just lets go.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** Oh, you know what?

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** Wait a minute.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:57]** Luvaia was using the Emberflame Dash Go and can only take one turn because they're staggered.

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:01]** So Luvaia can't switch weapons to fire.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** Why are they staggered?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** Because of the Electrovor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** Okay.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:05]** Yeah.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:05]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:07]** Yeah, which is wild.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:11]** So, instead... Ooh, what is Zavai going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** She can only do one thing.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** I was going to say, is she going to move or is she going to swing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:19]** Well, she can take a swift action, so she can let go of... The Dashko.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:23]** The Dashko that's just sitting in the door.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:33]** And then is going to pull out the roto laser and step forward, pointing it at the friggin' Electrobor.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** That seems like a... What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** Whatever.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:41]** She's stepping forward with a ranged weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:45]** Yeah, because she's pulling out the weapon as she's stepping forward.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** Okay.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:48]** Does Electrovor get an attack of opportunity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** That's when she fires, right?

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:52]** The next round, Electrovor is going to get an attack of opportunity.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** Or someone else will if they move out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:59]** But she also drops her Dashko in place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** So drops the Dashko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:02]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:04]** Draws a weapon.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** And moves.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:05]** And moves.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:12]** And you can draw a weapon and move as a single move action because presumably her base attack bonus is plus whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** And dropping weapons is a free weapon.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:15]** I'm just pointing out that the dash coat stays where it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:16]** Yeah.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:16]** Right.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:17]** Exactly.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:21]** If, you know, any of us wanted to collect an ember flame with a dash coat.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:21]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** I meant more of for combat.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** She can't take melee attacks with a dash coat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:31]** Oh, yeah, no, she definitely is not a Vesk who has incredible claws that count as melee weapons that she can use any time.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** Yeah, you know, it's fine.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:42]** One thing to note, most creatures from here on out will probably, like, they are all past level 1, so they will all have some sort of base attack bonus that will allow them to move.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:44]** Same obviously goes for...

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** You all.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:48]** Not saying it won't come up again, just putting it in your minds.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** All right, so they're staggered.

**[00:27:49 - 00:28:02]** They take a step forward, realizing that they're trying to, I feel like Ludvig is stepping forward, trying to take a shot and is just moving and jerking a little bit from all this impulses still cascading and coursing through her body.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:05]** That is the end of round one.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** Let's move to round two.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:08]** It is Dr.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:09]** O.K.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:09]** 's turn.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:13]** What are you doing, Dr. Kontu Okatis?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:22]** Dr. Okay has his tactical syringe spear out from prior.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:32]** And before he does anything, though, he wants to kind of move closer and intently look at our friend, our laser-eyed friend.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:36]** And something you said, John, last...

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:46]** Last bout of combat really stuck a craw in my mind as far as what condition they're under.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:56]** You had said the healing from the infirmary was allowing... Who's the person in distress?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** Kaniko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** Kaniko.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:01]** He specifically mentioned treatment.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Yeah.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:09]** So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to come up and flank Torv.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:09]** Okay.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** Can you do that?

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:15]** You'd probably actually go around to not incur an AOL, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:15]** Yes.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** So you would like... Yes.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** I'm just assuming.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:19]** I don't know.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** Here.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** I mean, I can go back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:21]** No, no, no.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** You don't have to do it.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** Hold on.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** Let me take my time to go.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:26]** I'm just noting that you would probably do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:35]** I'll move around the Battle Axe wielding dwarf from behind.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:40]** And I'm actually going to administer a pharmacological booster.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** Okay.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:46]** So the net effect is it's a positive.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** It's not going to hurt anyone.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:55]** But it's going to treat the bleed condition, which effectively they're not under.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** So it's not really doing anything.

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:06]** But I'm wondering if mechanically this is going to arrest the effects of...

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** based on that treatment?

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:10]** Like, could I, could I roll to see if that would like possibly work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:13]** You already did a medicine check before, which was really good.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:18]** And I think you probably, cause I don't want you to do this and then me be like, Oh, too bad.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:22]** You know, like I think you would know that like, it's not going to do anything.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:27]** That it's not going to do anything because the link here is that Kaniko is also unaffected.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:38]** So you would be thinking maybe there's something in Kaniko's medication or treatment specifically that prevented her from being subject to that program.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** Totally fine then.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:46]** I appreciate the disclosure there based on my medicine, whatever, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:47]** All good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** Maybe, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** Trying to play it straight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:55]** Because I was just like, oh, maybe if I heal this person, then maybe they'll snap out of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:58]** Maybe they'll snap out of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:58]** So I can't.

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** Wait.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:02]** No, I was just saying that and I wasn't thinking.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:03]** It's okay.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** I'm sorry.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:04]** That was all me.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** That was so bad.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** That was a little weird.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:07]** No, no, no.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:13]** I was literally thinking about a turn or a move several turns from now.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:15]** So you're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** Okay.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:21]** So in that case, I'm going to hit Torv with an inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:22]** Okay.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** Yeah.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:24]** Okay.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** Yeah, sorry about that.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:28]** You caught my attention with its pants down.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:30]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:35]** Okay, so you're hitting with an inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:39]** Yeah, I'm going to do the pharmacological inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** Okay.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:43]** And... What does that do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:45]** Slash, what does Tor need to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:50]** First of all, I'm hitting with this tactical syringe spear, and I got a dirty 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:51]** Ooh, okay.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:52]** Solid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:55]** So now I'm rolling for damage.

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** And that's almost max.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** That is 12 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** Is this lethal or non-lethal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:04]** This would be lethal.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:08]** I mean, I guess I could do non-lethal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:12]** which will be a 16, which still hits.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:15]** Ooh, nice to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:18]** And the effects of the pharmacological inhibitor...

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:24]** Target gains the... is encumbered and also entangled.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:28]** Fort save negates DC 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:31]** Fort save negates DC 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:35]** Let me read the full thing.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:42]** So it says, you introduce a mild hallucinogen into a living creature's body, making it difficult for the target to move or act.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:46]** The target automatically gains the encumbered condition

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:51]** and must succeed at a fortitude save or also gain the entangled condition.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:55]** This is a mind affecting poison effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:58]** Mind affecting poison effect.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** Okay.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:02]** They are dwarfs, so they do have some bonuses to effects against poison.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:11]** However, this is probably not the same, but you see Torv get hit from the back.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:15]** And then, Rick, they blink.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:22]** The eye closes and opens, and then the axe drops, and Torv falls to the ground unconscious.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** You have knocked Torv unconscious.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** Yeah.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** Nice.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** Yeah.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** With your hit there.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** Well done.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:40]** Steps up behind, takes Torv, not mechanically, but effectively by surprise, I imagine, and knocks out Torv.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** I'm very confused.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:45]** So did he knock him out with hit points?

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:46]** Yes.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:50]** And you said non-lethal, right?

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** That was non-lethal, right, Dr. Okay?

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:52]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** Yeah, so they fall unconscious.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:59]** The effect would not have knocked them out, like make them unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** Right, I just was clarifying.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:03]** I didn't know if that was the case or not.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** I was like, wait a minute, what's going on here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:06]** They still got to roll the fourth save, though.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:11]** Because if they come back, there's still an effect under however many rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** Sure.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:17]** I will say that, like the others, they went down and they don't seem like they're going to get up.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** So I assume that they failed the fourth save automatically.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** So the effect is in there.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:24]** So they're, what, encumbered and entangled?

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:27]** It's just who knows how long they're going to be down.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:31]** And you said this lasts on the order of 20 to, right?

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** How many rounds?

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** Let me double check.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** I mean, I will add it.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** Seven.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:37]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:40]** So it'll last for about close to a minute.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:41]** Yeah.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** And we'll see what happens.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:47]** But, you know, they are effectively encumbered and entangled, but they're mostly unconscious.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:49]** Because you slammed him with that hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:52]** And that completely changed everything I was going to do.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** Thanks, Will.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:57]** Yeah, it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** I was flanking for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** I know, I know.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** And I was, like, preparing to go into, like, melee combat.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:06]** Anyway, so Rick is, like, thinking through his next moves.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:09]** He's got his artillery laser pointed at this dwarf.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:12]** And the dwarf just drops.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:17]** And Rick kind of just, his mind flickers to a different, you know, mode of combat, essentially.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** And he just steps over the dwarf.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** Murder man.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:21]** And steps past Dr. O.K.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:23]** and says, excuse me, like very casually.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:24]** And then.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:27]** Next to Melt-A-Man.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:32]** So just next to Melt-A-Man and just past Dr. O.K.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:36]** And I'm going to take a shot at Livia.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** Livia?

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** Ludvia, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** You are no longer exhausted, right?

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:42]** Because this is the second round that you're exhausted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** No longer exhausted.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:46]** Not that that would impact my shooting abilities because I'm a boss.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Murderbot boss.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** Murderboss, not murderbot.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** Clarification.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Murderboss.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:56]** Speaking of murdering, this is going to be a non-lethal attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:57]** Okay.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** So it's a lethal attack.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:02]** Not non-lethal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** A not non-lethal?

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:04]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:04]** Okay, cool.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** A not non-lethal attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:06]** So it's a plus five.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:11]** That's a 19 on the die.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** It's a what on the die?

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** A 19.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** One nine.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Nine.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** Plus five.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** And that's including the minus four.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:20]** So does a 24 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:25]** Yes, and it also hits the Electrovor, killing the Electrovor instantly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** That's not how that works.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** What just happened?

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** I'm so accurate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:37]** So you hit Ludvaia with the shot, who is just looking down at the Electrovor, about to knock it out of existence.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:41]** That's a decent HP Electrovor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:50]** That's going to be three plus five for eight points of non-lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:54]** Eight points of lethal damage to Ludvaia.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** Okay.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:59]** And you all hear Rick say, die, die.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:03]** And as we've heard many, many times before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:05]** Every time he shoots.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** Come on.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** Rick, I'm just trying to get some water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:16]** So you step casually over Torv and say, excuse me, doctor.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:16]** Okay.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:23]** And then just like with probably perfect accuracy, fire the shot at Ludvija.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:33]** hitting the huge hulking Vesk in the shoulder, and their shoulder pulls back the gun, flares up, kills Electrovor instantly, and it's really sad and unfortunate.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** That is their whole turn.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:42]** It would be Torv's turn, but Torv is unconscious, so it is going to be Colin Edenbrand's turn.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:44]** What are you doing over there in the corner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:48]** I've got a harebrained scheme that I wanted to run by you, Mr. GM dude.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:57]** I want to move over to right next to Torv and use my mind link ability.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:09]** I want to mind link Torv to get as much information as possible on what is causing them to turn hyper aggressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:11]** Can you mind link an unconscious creature?

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** It doesn't say you can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:15]** You linked your mind.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** Are they unconscious or are they...

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** At zero hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** They are stable and unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:25]** To swiftly communicate a large amount of complex information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** They are down.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** Oh, I think it's a one-way transfer from you to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:29]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** I think I might have misunderstood mind link.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** That's okay.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** Yeah.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:36]** Just kill them and we'll cast grave words.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:38]** Yeah, that's some shit.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** I kind of hate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** Just kill them and cast grave words.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:42]** Thanks, Will.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** That was great.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** That's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:45]** Cool.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:47]** Then I think I'm going to keep it moving.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:56]** to next to Rick, and I will use tele... That's where Melt-A-Man is.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** Melt-A-Man!

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:58]** Melt-A-Man!

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** Melt-A-Man's a small creature, though, right?

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:02]** I was going to say, is Melt-A-Man big enough where I can't occupy the same square?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** No, you cannot occupy the same square.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:09]** But he's also technically unconscious, isn't he?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** No, Melt-A-Man's just chilling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:15]** You just haven't... Melt-A-Man's just, like, sitting around watching.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:17]** Yeah, thanks for the help, Melt-A-Man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:20]** Is he going to provide soft cover, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** Maybe.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:27]** I'm going to use telekinetic projectile on one of the wrenches that I knocked over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:29]** Nice.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:30]** I love that.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:32]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:37]** Give me your best throw there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:42]** For those who saw the Timmy Chalamet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** Skrrt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:49]** That is ranged attack.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:54]** I don't know how to see what I'm actually rolling.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:57]** It's going to be your ranged attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:02]** Yeah, it's your ranged attack bonus, which is usually your base attack bonus plus your dex bonus, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:09]** It's underneath your battery if you have any, and it says attack bonuses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Ranged attack.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:10]** There it is.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:14]** So that is a 13 to hit the Vesk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:19]** Bounce us off the wall, missing the vest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Cool.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:27]** So I will take minus one wrench in my inventory, and there we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Thank you.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:37]** Behind the scenes, I'm a big stickler for your wrench, your total number of wrenches that you use per episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:42]** The wrench difficulty constant is one we've really got to actively manage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** We do.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** We do.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** It's actually a big part of the economy.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** The wrench economy.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** Huge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:52]** The wrench action economy is... The wrench action economy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:55]** Yes.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** All righty.

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:10]** So Rick 19, I will say that you notice that the door to the med bay opens and it is now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** Here's his turn.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** Okay.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** Sorry.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:15]** The door just passed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** Yeah.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:20]** The door that they were trying to open opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** I don't like this.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** Kears, what are you doing?

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:28]** Well, Ludvia, whatever, is still up the vest.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:33]** So Kears' concern for Electrovor is just like, oh, no, it's too close.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** But does notice.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** Does he notice the door opening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** I don't think you can see the door opening.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:40]** Didn't we hear it?

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:40]** Dr.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:42]** O.K., yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:42]** Everybody hears it.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** Can I roll a perception to see if I heard it?

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:45]** Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:51]** You could be three stories up and you'd still hear it.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:54]** You would see it because you're right behind.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:59]** You would see the light come out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:03]** Well, it was when Kelly was stuck.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:05]** That's how you guys knew I let Kelly out.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** It was because you guys were three stories up.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** We heard the kloosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:12]** Kelly being awkwardly stuck.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** What was that noise?

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:13]** Who's opening doors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** That was classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** Amazing.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** All right, so what did you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** I got a six.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** Yeah, no, you don't know.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** This is the...

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:28]** Yeah, when it comes to gameplay stuff, it's like... This is where it gets kind of weird for me.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:35]** I'm like... Because as Kelly, I know that I shouldn't be doing another electrical discharge if that person's out now.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** You know what I mean?

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** Who's possibly an ally.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** But Heroes doesn't f***ing know that.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:39]** Right.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:44]** So then, like, what would... Do you just go with, like, what your character would do, I guess?

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:44]** Yep.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:44]** Yes.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** Absolutely.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:50]** I do apologize, but Electivore performs another electrical discharge.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:50]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** What's the range on that?

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:54]** Because now Rick is also getting closer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** Yeah.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** No, you wouldn't be safe.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** Actually, here sees Rick.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:02]** No, here sees Rick, so he wouldn't do it then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** Wait, is this hooded creature?

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** That's supposed to be Electivore?

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** That's Electivore, apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:10]** You also shocked Meltaman last time.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:11]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** Sorry, Meltaman.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:12]** No, he's too far.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** Okay.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:17]** Anyway, here does see Rick, so he won't do that.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** Okay.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** All right.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** Tail slap.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** Tail slap, Electivore.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:25]** And Electrovor just does a giant bitch slap of a tail slap on the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:31]** How high does Electrovor jump in order to do this?

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:32]** The face is tall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** Acrobatic animal.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** Like, you know what I mean.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:38]** So we're talking all the way up.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** Slow motion.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** Lightning bolt shaped tail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:51]** Streaks of light are passing by it as it's frozen in time and it's screaming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** Exactly.

**[00:43:53 - 00:44:00]** So this is a I'm going to roll to hit, which is 29 to hit.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:01]** 29?

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:05]** What is Electrovor's bonus?

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** That's wild.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** It's a plus 9.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:09]** I know, it's crazy.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** Wait, so you critically hit?

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:11]** Yeah.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** It's a natural 20, yeah.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** I just realized.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:17]** Does something special happen?

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** Do I get a critical hit?

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** Yes, you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** That's wild, man.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** I'm trying not to kill them, though.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:29]** Is this lethal or non-lethal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** It's non-lethal.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** It's a tail slab.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:33]** It can be non-lethal.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:36]** It's a 25, which still hits.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:37]** It's fine.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** I won't do a critical hit then.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** No, no, no.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** It's a critical non-lethal hit.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Oh, you can do that?

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:44]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:44]** You're good.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** You just took a minus four.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** Tell me when to stop.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:47]** Ready?

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Here we go.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** 3, 2, 1.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** Stop.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** Stop, stop, stop.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** I stopped, I stopped, I stopped.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** Sorry, there's latency.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:58]** Physics.

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:00]** Okay, this is an energy, right?

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** It's bludgeoning damage.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** Oh, it's kinetic.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** Yeah, it's just a tail slap.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** Shock and awe.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:09]** The target is staggered for one round.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** Another stagger.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:13]** Another round of being staggered.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:15]** Freaking shocking.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** Wow, amazing.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:19]** All right, time to roll for damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** Seven damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** Not lethal, please.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** Damage and a half, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** Did you double it?

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:25]** You roll twice.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:26]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** It's double.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:28]** You roll once and double.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** No, you roll twice.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:32]** I rolled a 14.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:32]** You roll twice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** Okay.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:36]** Yeah, I'm pretty sure you roll twice and then you add your bonuses.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** Oops.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** Oh, f*** it.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** My bad.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:39]** That's not right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** Don't make me look bad.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:43]** So, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:46]** 11 points of bludgeoning damage.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** 11 points of damage.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** It's rolled twice, Kev.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Don't worry.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:49]** Okay.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** So 11 points of damage.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** It is rolled twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** It's rolled twice.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:58]** If she had glasses on, they'd be knocked clear off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:05]** Pretend for a second that she did and they get scattered all over the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:10]** My son did that to me when I told him to get in the car and then he couldn't start the car.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:13]** He was like, and smacked my mouth and my sunglasses off my face.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** You can tell him not to.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:17]** That'd be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:19]** His nickname is Electrovor now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** Absolutely.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:22]** It's Electrovor.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:23]** All right.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** Here's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:51]** commanding electrovore to do an acrobatic in 10 out of 10 olympic level jump slap critical slap to the face you doing anything else with your turn here's might as well uh see if melt demand because it might come in handy can be controllable um in some way uh and so that's a move action to move action to i'm already next to him oh yeah yeah okay no electrovore moves on their own once they're


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:51 - 00:47:12]** out right oh it's like the drone so like so i think so here still has a standard action though i think it's i think it's the same rules as like drone so you can do like full um kind of control command and that would be your full action you basically get like half an action


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:41]** or like a standard add it so the Electro 4 used a standard action to attack yeah and then you still have that means that here still has full round and move action and attack action something like that but I think it's you can do one or the other so you can't move you can't do both so you you're not actually getting an extra round or like half an action or whatever but the way that it works is you can do you can do your two standards kind of yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:44]** Or you can move, I think.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Don't call me on anything.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** I can't find anything written on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:51]** It just says as a move action, you can return it or send it out.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:54]** It doesn't say anything about having an attack costing something, but maybe it does.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:56]** I just don't know.

**[00:47:56 - 00:48:21]** yeah i'm not sure it's up to uh maybe our rules lawyer and gm to make the call perhaps because i can't find info on it rick do you have anything to inform the decision because it feels like to me it's like i think you should be able to do a computer's check i mean i'm i'm reading but i'm pretty sure he could still do a standard action yeah yeah yeah i don't think you can do a standard action and move if you wanted to move as here's i think i think that'd be too much


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:28]** Yeah, you can't move and do a computer's check, but... But he can do a computer's check because he's already there.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** Oh, he didn't move.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Oh, okay, yeah.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:36]** Oh, yeah, then you can definitely do a computer's check, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:45]** So you're going to do a computer's check to get Meltaman to... I thought a normal turn was a move action and a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** So then what's the debate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:52]** What does it cost to make the election board do something, basically?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** Got it.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:57]** I think it's just because it's a summoned creature, I think it's a verbal command.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** So it's basically a free action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:00]** Great.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** So you can move and say no doubt.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:05]** That's how I'm feeling like it is too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:08]** That's how I'm reading it, because it doesn't say there's any restrictions on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** Yeah, I don't see why not.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** So yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** So it's a lucky thing.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:21]** So it's 23, and Hears wants to see if he can co-opt the programming of Melt-A-Man and command it, I guess.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:22]** Have the party command it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** Uh...

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Maybe that's a big ask.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** You reach out.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:41]** Yeah, I don't know that you command it, but if you want it to help you out and take suggestions from you, then as you type it in, then Meltaman stands up and is like, do you need help, citizen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:50]** Yes, I need you to non-lethally hit or restrain that Vesk around the corner, Meltaman.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** Stay back.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** I will handle this.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** Excellent.

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:03]** And uses his move action to take out a cigarette and just sit back and enjoy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** Small Soldiers is one of my favorite movies ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:09]** I'm just going to... It's a great movie.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:09]** Amazing.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:10]** Awesome.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:15]** So you have Elitchford do an awesome slap, and then you get Melt the Man to help out.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** I think that's totally valid.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:18]** Good, solid move.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** You know whose turn it is?

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** Ludvaya.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:27]** And Ludvija was going to attack Rick because Rick did a crazy shot.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:31]** But then Electrofork got this critical hit.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:35]** And now Ludvija can only do, again, one action, right?

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:39]** It's either going to be a move or a standard.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:43]** And I think, ooh, this is a tough call.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** You know what?

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:46]** Ludvaia is a killer.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:55]** Ludvaia is going to shoot the rotolaser at Electrovor, and Electrovor will get an AOL.

**[00:50:56 - 00:51:00]** And Ludvaia does not think the Electrovor is going to be too much of a threat.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** So Ludvaia is fine with an AOL here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** Everyone just underestimates Electrovor.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** It's not wise.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** Just saying.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:12]** So an attack, I can just do whatever basically is an attack of opportunity, right?

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** Yeah, well, you can do a melee attack.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** All right, cool.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:16]** That's good.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:21]** It's such a good bonus and yet only a 10 to hit.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:27]** Doesn't have the same spring for that double jump to try and tail slap again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Yeah, it's rough.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:34]** Sad little somersault and then just kind of on its tummy all vulnerable now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:36]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** It's like playing like a cat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** Oh, Melt-A-Man, hurry up.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** That's a 19 against EAC.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:46]** Yeah, that hits.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** Yeah, that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** Ruh-roh, Reggie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:59]** Seven points of damage as this... As this roto laser fires just five feet in front of Ludvaia.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:06]** And what I will say is that every time that there's a... Every time that there's a shot...

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:10]** then the light level starts to increase because it's really bright.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** Each shot is like, shoo, shoo, shoo.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:20]** And the light area in this area right around Electrovor is going to increase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:22]** So are people going to get blinded or something?

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** Is that what's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:27]** No, I'm just saying that the flavor thing.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:34]** Basically, the lingering effect because each shot has the bright condition on it.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:39]** So each shot will cause the light level to increase in the area for one round.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** So that is Ludvija's turn.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** Is Electrobor still up with seven points of damage?

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:44]** Probably.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** Yeah, he's still up.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:47]** All right.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** End of round two.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** Round three.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:50]** Dr.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** O.K., what are you doing?

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** You're standing behind Rick19.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:54]** People are starting to crowd in on Ludvija.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:55]** Yeah.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** So Dr. O.K.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:58]** is going to put away his spear.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** Okay.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:05]** And take a shot with the Costa Jet liquidator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** Costa Jet.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** Is that soft cover?

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** Because you're right behind Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:12]** I would imagine so, yeah.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:13]** Plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** Minus four.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:17]** Plus four, depending on who you're... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** It's plus four to the enemies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:21]** To the AC, which is essentially taking minus four from the shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** It's fine.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** I don't want to argue it.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:24]** So I got to roll high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** You sound like you want to argue.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:26]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** All right.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:31]** So I'm going to roll.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:37]** And I'm going to use a – no, I'm not going to use any biohack.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:44]** I'm just going to try and do – if I do non-lethal, then it's like minus eight, right?

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:44]** Yeah.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** Total?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** Yeah.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:49]** You don't worry about the cover because the cover is for me to do the plus four.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** So just do a minus four.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:53]** I don't want to get in something where we're like, well, this equals this.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:56]** Keep it whatever it is.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** Unless you don't want to do non-lethal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** Yeah, I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:01]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:04]** Does Dr. Okay?

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:06]** Yeah, I don't know if Dr. Okay would be.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** Yeah, I think he would do non-lethal.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** Okay, so he's going to be the minus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** It's a tough choice.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** It's a tough choice.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:16]** Rick, I can't shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:21]** And that totally makes sense because I rolled a 10.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Oh, wow.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** With the minus.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** So it was 14 with a minus 4.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:33]** Actually, it's a 12 because I rolled a 14 plus my attack bonus is 6.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:40]** So then it would be a 20 minus 4 is 16?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:42]** 20 minus 4.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** So 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:45]** You rolled a 10.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:46]** Yeah.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** And it's EAC or K. No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** I rolled a 14.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:58]** But I was pre-counting the minus four, but I didn't count my plus six range attack bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** Okay, so you rolled a 14.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** So it's a 20.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:03]** So minus four is 16.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:08]** And again, is it EAC or KAC?

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:09]** It's piercing, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** Injection?

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** Yeah, so it's KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:16]** Shot fires.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:20]** right as Ludvija moves, and it pings off the armor.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** You just missed.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:28]** You had it right on sight, even though Rick19 was in front of you, and it just missed just barely.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:30]** Close.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** Tough round for Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:36]** He's going to direct Bernice to try and get a clear shot for the next round.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:37]** Okay.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:40]** Bernice, see what you can do.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:43]** And then...

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:49]** I guess move through Colin and Meltaman to here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:50]** Okay.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:51]** So right past.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** So getting close.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:57]** Y'all are really starting to corner in on this one doorway where Ludwia is standing.

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:58]** I like it.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:01]** I don't like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Good round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:03]** Yeah.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** Good or good turn.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:05]** You want to do anything else?

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** Say anything else or anything?

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** No.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:14]** That was a nice attempt, Dr. Okay.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:17]** I will provide you some pointers when we have some downtime.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:22]** Rick is then going to inform everyone...

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:25]** The door to the medical lab just opened.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:29]** Be aware of all the doors around us as he levels up.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:31]** Is Electrofor down or not?

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:32]** You level up?

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:34]** No, I level up my weapon.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** I raise my weapon.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** Up to level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:40]** It's killing language you wouldn't understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:47]** It's the soldier speak that only a murder bot could really know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:48]** Electrofor's not down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:50]** Oh, he's still up.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:52]** Okay.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** So with that, yeah.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** It's a small creature.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** Right.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** There's no cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:00]** Yeah, there's no cover from the small creature.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:00]** You're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:02]** You're fine.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** I'm just going to do a normal attack with non-lethal.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** Normal attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** Fesk is hardy.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** I mean, I got to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** Yes, yes.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** Normal attack, non-lethal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:14]** Normal attack, non-lethal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:16]** Natural 20.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:18]** Nice.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:20]** What?

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:20]** Wow.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** Wow.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** You think I'd be that excited about natural one?

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** Natural four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:26]** Natural four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** I mean, maybe, I don't know.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:29]** That's awesome.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** All right, let's do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:40]** So all this chaos going on, Rick is going to then just like aim right dead center for her chest, knowing that's the hardest piece of armor and that his laser won't pierce it.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** But it will do the largest amount of damage.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:46]** Just to the recoil and force.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:46]** Here we go.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:46]** Ready?

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** Three, two, one.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** Stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:55]** This is a, remind me again, what type of damage is this?

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** Kinetic?

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:58]** Laser kinetic.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:00]** No, laser energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** Fire type.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:01]** EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:03]** EAC.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** Buffeted about.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** The target is flat footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Oof.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:12]** For one D4 round, so roll me a D4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** A D4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:15]** Throw that caltrop.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** Give me...

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** That's a four on the die.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** That's a four rounds.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** That's like three more rounds than we need.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:26]** Rude.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:29]** You underestimate her prowess.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:30]** All right.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** Four rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:37]** Four is 12 plus 10 for 22 points of non-lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:38]** Are you joking me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** Wow.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:40]** No, I'm serious.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:41]** Wow.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** Say goodnight, Vesk.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:46]** Ah, dang.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:46]** This is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** Okay, 22 points.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:51]** Non-lethal.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:51]** Non-lethal.

**[00:58:52 - 00:59:05]** Ludvaia staggers a bit and then just shakes it and both of her feet stamp on the ground as she is firmly planning herself to f*** y'all up.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** Actually, I take that back.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** Scratch all that.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:10]** I was looking at somebody else's HP.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:13]** You hit that and she just...

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** Goosh.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:18]** Balls to the ground unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** Okay, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:23]** Directly onto the Electrovor.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:25]** Killing it instantly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** Smashing damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:29]** Smashing it instantly.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:34]** You have taken out Torv and Ludvaia.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:40]** And there's just a brief moment of pause.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:45]** And then you see a gun come out.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:46]** Point left.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:47]** Point right.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:55]** And then out steps a tall woman in regimental ceremonial armor.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** Looks down at Ludvaia.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:00]** Looks up at you, Rick and Dr. O'K.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:01]** Nice work.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** Thank you.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:06]** Holsters.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:07]** Their gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:14]** Thank you for... I told you to hold still and that we would come to you.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:15]** You did.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** And I appreciate it.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:18]** Thank you.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:21]** Sorry, I just want to clarify.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** This is... What's her name, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:27]** Kandika... We're really great with names on this podcast.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:30]** Solid.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** Kandika?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** This is Kandika?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** This is Kaniko.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** Kaniko.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:37]** Kaniko.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:42]** She steps in front and sees Hears and also Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:45]** And the Electropor gets an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** He doesn't know any better.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:50]** I'm sorry.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:51]** Stop it!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** Shoots it instantly.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]** Hey.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:56]** Wow.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:59]** That was... Thank you so much.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:01]** Thank you, the four of you.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:05]** I'm Kaniko, and introduces herself to everybody.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:10]** This is... This is a tragedy.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** You can tell she's

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:17]** Sat looking at Torv and Ludvija.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** They're still alive.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** You do not need to be concerned.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:22]** Okay, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** Are they stable?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:26]** Yeah, they're stable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:31]** Kiniko, do you mind if I have a look?

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:35]** There's some signs that your treatment might be the solution to this problem.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:38]** Tell me more about what you were doing in the midbay.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:51]** Well, I was in the med bay, actually, because I was recovering from the injuries that I sustained on Outpost Omicron, both from some burns on my leg and also some shots in my arm.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:58]** She points, you can see that underneath the armor, there's like a bit of extra padding from wounds that she is recovering from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:00]** How are they treating you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:03]** I've been resting and recovering.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:10]** I've had fluids and typical medicines to help heal along everything.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:12]** It's been typical steward's work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:16]** Can I roll something to see if she's bullshitting me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:23]** There's something about her that's kind of... I'm also going to roll separately with my zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:26]** Plus 11 for sense motive and medicine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:30]** I trust every word she's saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:33]** It's because she's like with the stewards or working with them at least.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:35]** She's part of Pike's Paratons, right?

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:38]** Yeah, I know, but she's working with them, so you probably trust her.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:40]** I got a 28.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:40]** 28.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:42]** Rick is a 4, unfortunately.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:44]** I got a 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:46]** All of you think that she is?

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:47]** What about Electrovor?

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:49]** Can her Electrovor roll a sense of motive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** No.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:54]** All of you think that, and as you're thinking of it,

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:57]** Melt the man is like, do you need more help?

**[01:02:57 - 01:03:00]** The Vesk is unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:01]** Turn to us, you hear us.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:02]** Stick with us, though.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:04]** You know, hang out with us, all right?

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** We might need your help soon.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:06]** But good work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:08]** I can only do so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:09]** There might be other dangers, Melteman.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:11]** Please be on the watch.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** Danger is my middle name.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:14]** I will defend all of you.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** Gun gets ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:21]** Colin audibly chuckles at Dr.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:21]** O.K.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:22]** 's Melteman impression.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:25]** Hmm.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:25]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:28]** Thank you, Melteman.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** You are welcome.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:32]** I will bring you back a souvenir.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:34]** This is like a head of someone.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:37]** Yeah, it's a bloody stump.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:43]** The man just goes on a killing spree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:45]** I'm trying to impress Rick.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:49]** It turns to Rick and says, I am everything.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:49]** You are not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:57]** I will bathe in the blood of my enemies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:00]** You do not drink enough blood.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:02]** Murderbot.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:03]** It's like Murderbot v. Murderbot now.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:05]** Yeah, I know.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:06]** It's like crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:11]** Everything that Kaniko is saying seems...

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:13]** Trustworthy.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:17]** They seem like they are clearly not fully healed.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** They've been interrupted.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:28]** They are concerned, and they seem like Gnarla in that they are willing to just in the moment act, be kind and friendly, but also be decisive.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:34]** They are absolutely probably not a rank and file Periton.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:37]** They are probably more of a leader type.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:38]** I don't know.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:40]** Nothing says it seems, but this is all we have for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:45]** So can you go, do you know what drugs were administered to you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:46]** That's a really great question.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:48]** You sound like somebody who would know.

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:50]** So I do not know.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:51]** Yeah, I do not.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:53]** That is not my specialty.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:56]** I am happy to point you out to where they are.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** Please.

**[01:04:57 - 01:05:02]** She starts to walk over, walks through the door and into the call and follows her doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:03]** Okay.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:04]** He's also going to follow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:05]** Okay.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:11]** I think Rick's going to take this time to clear the area and just stand guard.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:12]** Okay.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:13]** He'll do that with Melt-A-Man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:22]** He calls Electrovor back onto his shoulder and takes the form of a figurine again.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:22]** Okay.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:25]** You stick with Rick for now, Melt-A-Man.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:31]** Bernice is going to dance around Melt-A-Man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:54]** come on john i want to hear about i want to hear a 10-4 bro i mean come on this is what you do right you gotta relay do you understand i am considering who is in charge between me and this rick but for now i will follow uh all right so i think rick can handle himself so here's where do you go it's frightening


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:59]** Well, here's what's curious about... He's going in the... Actually... Ah, s***.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:00]** Is this door open over here?

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:01]** This door?

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:03]** No, don't go in the door by yourself.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:05]** Yeah, I'm not going to do that.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:06]** I'm not going to.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:06]** I'm just curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** There's nothing at the end of the hallway, right?

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:09]** Just two more doors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:12]** I guess he'll ask... You can explore.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:14]** Kaniko, like, Kaniko, what's in the other two rooms?

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:15]** Is there anyone in there?

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:16]** What are they for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:18]** So, the other room is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:35]** is going to be another med bay and then there is a brig as well as a post to monitor the brig that could come in handy with all these folks out of their excellent gourd so to speak that is uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:46]** Yes, if they get violent, I think we should absolutely, or rather if they get violent again, then I think we should definitely put them in there.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:50]** But I am very concerned.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:51]** I hope they're okay.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:56]** I appreciate you taking them down gracefully, let's say.

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:59]** I don't want to lose my friends.

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:01]** Okay.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:03]** Is there anyone in the medbay or the brig?

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:04]** Sorry.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:09]** Before I answer that, Colin and Dr. Okay, right?

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:11]** And she points to the opposite of both of you.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:11]** Oh, sorry.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:13]** Dr. Okay and Colin.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:16]** And you can tell that she cares about getting your name right.

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:19]** The way that she presents herself socially is important.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:22]** Do you both have everything that you need?

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:23]** Can I help them out?

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** I'll walk with them.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:39]** So like did she give us like a chart or something to check her – She walked in and she pointed to the chart and she pointed to where all of the drugs in the area were where there's – as you walk in the room, there's again one little light on as well as the blue nighttime running lights.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:41]** And –

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:56]** there's a whole counter and cabinets off to the right in the plan, and you can see that there's probably a lot of drugs in there, and then you can see the machines next to her bed where she can go see what's on the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:58]** Was her bed the one on the left or the one on the right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:00]** The one on the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:00]** Awesome.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:04]** Doctor, let me see if I can give us some light.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:08]** And he casts Glowing Wall on the ceiling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:10]** Glowing wall on the ceiling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:12]** That's dope.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:15]** So it's basically, it's a barrier of light.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:20]** I get eight 10-foot squares, so I'm just going to light up the whole room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:20]** Jeez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:21]** All right.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:22]** Just turn the light on.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:23]** That's freaking cool.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** Yeah, the light's not working.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:26]** They're dim.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:28]** No, it's just, yeah, they're just dim.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:30]** But as soon as you turn that on, boom.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:34]** As soon as you cast that, this glowing wall encompasses the ceiling.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:36]** I kind of imagine it moving out and spreading.

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:40]** And then... Yep.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:41]** Cool.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:43]** And there's a light on in there, and you can see.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:45]** And she says, all right, I'll be back.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:46]** Let me know if I can help with anything.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** Steps out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:49]** I'll have a look at the chart.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:55]** Would you mind having a look at the cabinet there to see if there's anything we might find useful?

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:55]** Sure.

**[01:08:56 - 01:09:00]** So Colin reads over the chart to see if there's anything that might...

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:08]** have an off-label use for protection against mind things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:10]** Classic.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:15]** Who knows?

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:29]** You look through and you can see that based on the cocktail that she was getting and what else is also available, you think that she had some sort of...

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:55]** head injury and what she was taking allowed her to block programming there yeah there is a drug that is known to boost the you know cells in her body that allows you to resist sort of mental effects i again is there a is there a name to this drug is there a name to this drug there is a name to this drug


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:58]** Is this ask the right question, get the right answer?

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:59]** What's it called?

**[01:09:59 - 01:10:00]** It's called Xanthan.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:01]** Xanthan.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:05]** Doctor, I see Xanthan on this chart.

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:06]** Do you see any in that covenant?

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:07]** Do I roll or?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:10]** Yeah, you can find it.

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:11]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:12]** Yeah, okay.

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:13]** I'm going to grab it then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:14]** It's all there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:16]** How much do we have there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:40]** i don't know there's enough for well my question is what do you want to do like there's there's not a lot but you don't have just one little vial you have a couple vials right i i would like as a as a player i would want to take stock of how many doses we have so that we could potentially snap that many npcs out of


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:43]** The brain block.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:43 - 01:10:43]** Yeah, that's curious.

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:44]** If Dr. O.K.

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:50]** were to inject somebody with this while they were under the influence, would they just come out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:52]** Could we potentially synthesize more?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:58]** You think you have enough that you could synthesize a...

**[01:10:58 - 01:11:02]** that can be used as an injection, right?

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:04]** So either with Dr. O.K.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:09]** or there's also probably some syringes nearby that you could give to somebody who's not Dr.

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:09]** O.K., right?

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:14]** You probably have enough for each of the four of you to get one dose.

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:25]** And what this does is it would deal a bunch of non-lethal damage to them, like 4D10, right?

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:36]** And allow them to be taken out very quickly and also perhaps begin to quickly remove some of the programming that they've already experienced.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:39]** But you need to make a medicine check to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:40]** Well, I'll do that.

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:47]** I was going to say, who's got the, hey doctor, should we split these up or do you want all of them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:59]** Well, I can synthesize them and then we can divvy them if you want, or I can keep them handy and throw them in the cost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:11]** I think if we could give you all except for one, I think having a bit of an insurance policy to rescue you in dire straits might be a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:13]** Works for me.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:17]** So before you tell me your roll, Will, you all start working on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:17]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:21]** If you want to roll and have it in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:23]** I'm going to let you roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:45]** uh bernice know through the the comm unit that we're gonna help she's gonna we're we're busy synthesizing what's like 10 minutes takes 10 minutes yep and i just took off the combat tracker sorry i forgot about that yeah it takes take don't forget we can take 20 minutes on on things take 10 or take 20 are rules that we never ever use so now would be a time to use something like that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:47]** Well, I don't think I could do a 20.

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:52]** I don't think I could take 10 or 20 on crafting an item like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:59]** I think with a medicine check, it would be enough for you to put together something and then balance it out.

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:02]** So let's go to Rick and Hears.

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:11]** While Dr. O'Kay and Colin are talking, Kaniko steps out and says, are you thinking about exploring here?

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:12]** I'm happy to show you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:15]** I am just asking for additional hostiles.

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:18]** Is there anybody in these two rooms that we need to be aware of?

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:20]** Right, so good thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:24]** There are probably only a few of us that are unaccounted for, I think.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:28]** Hesper, Eil, and Orgat.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:42]** And you said that you were on the bridge, so would that have been Shay, Narla, she's thinking, Ezra, Fitch, and...

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:43]** I guess who else would be up there?

**[01:13:43 - 01:13:44]** Oh, Sarzel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:45]** Yes, that is correct.

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:47]** And they are unconscious too?

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:53]** She explains, Rick explains that the three were turned violent.

**[01:13:53 - 01:14:01]** We took them down, but the other two fell immediately without any kind of... And then he's going to explain like, are you aware of the situation?

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:03]** Has anybody informed you of what's happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:03 - 01:14:10]** No, I've been in the med bay this whole time, and then suddenly I just hear this banging, and that's when I reached out for help.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:13]** We have to check on the others.

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:14]** We have to either help them out.

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:16]** Maybe they resisted it like I did.

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:18]** Just take one second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:24]** This is going to sound insane, but we were all abducted by greys.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:25]** Yeah, that does sound insane.

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:27]** Okay.

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:31]** They also deleted about 24 hours from each of us.

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:40]** And we know this because Colin has hypnotized and recovered the memories from several people, including ourselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:41]** That's Colin right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:46]** So we confirmed that the greys are, in fact, responsible for what's happened.

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:47]** And it's been about 24 hours.

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:48]** Hours.

**[01:14:48 - 01:14:48]** Hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:49 - 01:14:50]** Hours.

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:53]** They're repeating hours and it flusters her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:54 - 01:15:00]** Does everyone... Rick's voice just kind of... I'm not going to ask what that was.

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:01]** That's fine.

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:02]** That's okay.

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:04]** All right.

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:13]** That does sound very unlikely, but there's literally no other explanation except unless maybe they took a, I don't know.

**[01:15:14 - 01:15:15]** Okay.

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:15]** Took what?

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:16]** Say again?

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:17]** What was that thought there?

**[01:15:17 - 01:15:18]** No offense.

**[01:15:18 - 01:15:21]** I was trying to think of a more rational solution.

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:26]** I do believe you, but just the way that I was thinking.

**[01:15:26 - 01:15:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:27 - 01:15:29]** We'd love to hear your thoughts.

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:32]** I mean, we have to be transparent with one another to get out of this.

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:36]** Your entire crew has kind of gone crazy.

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:37]** So tell us, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:38 - 01:15:39]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:39 - 01:15:44]** I'd like to point out that so far, only the Parks Paratons have been hostile.

**[01:15:44 - 01:15:44]** That's true, too.

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:48]** And I don't know if that is coincidental or if that is something more.

**[01:15:48 - 01:15:50]** That's interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:51]** Okay.

**[01:15:52 - 01:15:52]** All right.

**[01:15:52 - 01:15:54]** You can tell that she's weighing options, she's thinking.

**[01:15:55 - 01:15:55]** Okay.

**[01:15:56 - 01:15:58]** So then in that case, your explanation...

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:03]** Seems unlikely, but is probably the most correct one.

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:04]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:11]** She's also aware that they rescued us from the Grey's Outpost, so it's actually not that crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:12 - 01:16:14]** Yeah, but... Yeah, go ahead.

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:14]** Oh, no, I'm sorry.

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:16]** I don't want to interrupt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:16 - 01:16:22]** But, like, abducting and all that stuff, that might be a little far-fetched.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:36]** I mean, considering the fact that we did just, as you just said, Rick, escape the greys and people that were on my team died from an outpost run by greys, then I think it's... Again, that's why I believe you.

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:37]** I'm not disbelieving you.

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:39]** I'm just trying to weigh all the options.

**[01:16:39 - 01:16:41]** And you can tell that she is like...

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:49]** Trained to be very logical, like a lawyer or a diplomat would be thinking about this and trying to weigh all of her options.

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:51]** Look, you asked if there were hostiles in there.

**[01:16:51 - 01:17:00]** Unless for some reason Hesper or Orgat or Eyal have come up here, I think they would have been probably trying to bust out of those doors already.

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:04]** So last I know, they were probably – what time is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:04 - 01:17:30]** it's you know it's late it's deep in the it's deep in the night now um they were downstairs trying to sleep so that's probably where they are we can still investigate though if you'd like uh here's wants to rule am i wrong john and and that in thinking that she was about to say something but then stopped herself from saying something like an alternative explanation and now she's like refusing to recall what she was gonna say or like say it again i


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:30 - 01:17:33]** She doesn't seem like she's trying to refuse to recall it.

**[01:17:33 - 01:17:34]** She's just thinking through everything.

**[01:17:34 - 01:17:35]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:36 - 01:17:36]** Cool.

**[01:17:36 - 01:17:36]** She is.

**[01:17:37 - 01:17:40]** So she's not going to say like, if we ask her like, Hey, what was your alternative?

**[01:17:40 - 01:17:41]** Like theory?

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:43]** Like she won't say, cause we already asked her.

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:43]** She's not saying it.

**[01:17:44 - 01:17:48]** So I was just wondering if I need to roll a sense motive on that or whatever.

**[01:17:48 - 01:17:49]** You can roll a sense motive on it if you want.

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:51]** But what were you going to say?

**[01:17:52 - 01:17:53]** Like, what was she trying to say?

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:56]** Like, she went out with some information.

**[01:17:56 - 01:17:59]** Yeah, I think unless I'm misremembering or misunderstanding.

**[01:18:00 - 01:18:04]** You said you seemed like you had an alternative theory about what's going on.

**[01:18:04 - 01:18:05]** That's not right.

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:06]** What is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:06 - 01:18:16]** Okay, so what I was thinking was that for some reason maybe the pikes, the rest of the crew were trying to take over the ship.

**[01:18:16 - 01:18:21]** It also seems unlikely given that I am, you know, one of them.

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:23]** But maybe there was something that happened.

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:25]** But then you said that the stewards were not.

**[01:18:27 - 01:18:28]** My mind was going crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:30]** That raises so many more questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:32]** Should Will and I have headphones out for this?


## Speaker_0

**[01:18:34 - 01:18:34]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:34 - 01:18:36]** Yeah, you're right outside the door.

**[01:18:37 - 01:18:38]** I guess we didn't clarify that.

**[01:18:38 - 01:18:40]** So it's a long, slender hallway.

**[01:18:40 - 01:18:42]** It's only five foot wide, so single file.

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:48]** And the three of us are standing in that hallway just outside the door of the med bay where Dr. O.K.

**[01:18:48 - 01:18:49]** and Colin are.

**[01:18:49 - 01:19:13]** door's open um so rick rick like steps forward and almost into like shoulder to shoulder with here's as best you can in this tight space as you say that it's like is there any reason that the pikes peritons would attempt mutiny on this ship absolutely he looks her dead in the eye she doesn't back down from you and she says absolutely not sense motive

**[01:19:14 - 01:19:19]** I agreed with you that given the greys, there was probably some sort of abduction.

**[01:19:19 - 01:19:28]** And then Rick will explain, like, when we got to the bridge, something occurred in which Shea, what's her name, Nevarra?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:28 - 01:19:28]** Gnarla.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:19:29 - 01:19:30]** Gnarla?

**[01:19:31 - 01:19:32]** I know, I'm terrible with it.

**[01:19:32 - 01:19:38]** Gnarla, Shea, and the three Peritons that were standing watch on the bridge were fine.

**[01:19:39 - 01:19:51]** and something occurred where the five of them screamed at the same time and came in unison before turning towards us, and that is when Shay and the captain collapsed, and the others attacked us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:51 - 01:19:59]** We came down here as soon as you... We should have maybe looked at the logs of communications, perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:59 - 01:20:02]** You're saying this as y'all are working on the thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:02 - 01:20:06]** I'm just overhearing, and I'm searching through the cabinet in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:07 - 01:20:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:20:08 - 01:20:08]** Uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:09 - 01:20:14]** I understand Rick 19 and it sounds like this is a very tense moment for you.

**[01:20:15 - 01:20:16]** We'll get through this.

**[01:20:17 - 01:20:17]** Okay.

**[01:20:18 - 01:20:21]** Thank you again for being kind to them and not killing them.

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:23]** To all of you, thank you.

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:24]** She looks around at all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:25 - 01:20:37]** So I think at this point, Rick is going to suggest that we take a head count on everybody on board and make aware that we might run into other hostiles, including the people that we know.

**[01:20:37 - 01:20:44]** Everybody we know on board may or may not be trying to attack us, and we should go out, seek them, and subdue them if they need to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:44 - 01:20:47]** Also, the cat is out of the bag.

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:54]** If our captors outside the ship have initiated this, then they know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:54 - 01:20:55]** Okay.

**[01:20:56 - 01:20:56]** Good point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:57 - 01:21:00]** I say from inside the overhearing.

**[01:21:00 - 01:21:01]** I mean, yeah, you can hear me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:01 - 01:21:05]** Rick, you can tell that she is like Gnarla.

**[01:21:05 - 01:21:07]** She's like considering, she's like on your level.

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:08]** She's like, you're suggesting this?

**[01:21:08 - 01:21:10]** She's like, yeah, that's a good idea.

**[01:21:10 - 01:21:14]** Again, I think there are only three people who are not accounted for on the ship.

**[01:21:15 - 01:21:21]** So we should find them and then we need to deal with these captors, abductors.

**[01:21:22 - 01:21:22]** Absolutely.

**[01:21:23 - 01:21:24]** Be more people.

**[01:21:24 - 01:21:27]** Did you want to look here or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:28 - 01:21:29]** Further down the medbay?

**[01:21:29 - 01:21:31]** I mean, at this point, it's just like to clear the room.

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:33]** I don't assume anybody is in those rooms.

**[01:21:34 - 01:21:35]** Let's just do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:35 - 01:21:39]** She walks past you and just opens the door into the next medbay.

**[01:21:40 - 01:21:40]** No one there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:41 - 01:21:44]** All right, Rick will move down with her and clear the next room.

**[01:21:44 - 01:21:48]** She opens the brig and there's a gray sitting there.

**[01:21:48 - 01:21:48]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:49 - 01:21:50]** Handcuffs.

**[01:21:50 - 01:21:56]** She opens the door to the last area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:56 - 01:21:57]** And says, put them on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:58 - 01:21:59]** Put them on.

**[01:22:00 - 01:22:08]** This just appears to be a small room, 10 by 15, with a desk and a monitor to view what's going on in the brig.

**[01:22:08 - 01:22:13]** And then she walks forward, opens the door into the brig.

**[01:22:14 - 01:22:15]** There's no one in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:22:15 - 01:22:16]** He walks out.

**[01:22:16 - 01:22:20]** He's just going to go in the med bay and see if there are any things we could take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:21 - 01:22:23]** Sure.

**[01:22:23 - 01:22:24]** That's what they do.

**[01:22:24 - 01:22:25]** So two things.

**[01:22:25 - 01:22:28]** Dr. O'K, what did you roll for your medicine check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:22:29 - 01:22:30]** I rolled a 26.

**[01:22:30 - 01:22:32]** 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:32 - 01:22:37]** That is going to be enough to make four doses for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:22:38 - 01:22:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:39 - 01:22:42]** So you each can get one or however you want to divvy it up.

**[01:22:42 - 01:22:54]** Dr. K, you also find, as you're looking through, you find two serums of healing, Mark II.

**[01:22:55 - 01:22:55]** Mark II?

**[01:22:56 - 01:22:57]** Two Mark IIs.

**[01:22:57 - 01:22:58]** Two Mark IIs.

**[01:22:59 - 01:23:03]** You find two purple nanite hypopens.

**[01:23:04 - 01:23:04]** Okay.

**[01:23:06 - 01:23:11]** And you also find an advanced needler pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:23:11 - 01:23:12]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:23:13 - 01:23:13]** All right.

**[01:23:13 - 01:23:15]** Here's you.

**[01:23:15 - 01:23:16]** Advanced needler.

**[01:23:16 - 01:23:23]** You are in the other med bay room, and you find also two serums of healing mark two.

**[01:23:24 - 01:23:25]** Dope.

**[01:23:25 - 01:23:28]** You find two brown nanite hypo pens.

**[01:23:30 - 01:23:33]** And you find a dermal stapler.

**[01:23:33 - 01:23:34]** Okay.

**[01:23:34 - 01:23:35]** A skin stapler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:23:35 - 01:23:38]** I mean, anything's a dermal stapler if you're brave enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:23:38 - 01:23:41]** Two brown what pens?

**[01:23:42 - 01:23:46]** Two brown nanite hypo pens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:23:48 - 01:23:50]** You also know, Dr. O.K.

**[01:23:50 - 01:24:05]** and Colin, that this injection, this dose, will cause 4d10 non-lethal damage and that there is a dc17 fortitude save to take half of that damage from the creature.

**[01:24:06 - 01:24:07]** This is the will save thing?

**[01:24:08 - 01:24:09]** Fortitude save.

**[01:24:09 - 01:24:12]** This is the fortitude save injection dose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:24:12 - 01:24:14]** But it's for the attack.

**[01:24:15 - 01:24:23]** So you're saying if we run into somebody else who is under this spell thing, we can shoot them with that thing and they're going to take that much non-lethal damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:24 - 01:24:28]** Yeah, that's what they figured out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:24:31 - 01:24:36]** Does the range on this depend on the method of administration or...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:24:36 - 01:24:36]** Yes.

**[01:24:37 - 01:24:39]** Yes, like the needler gun or the syringe.

**[01:24:39 - 01:24:41]** Does the needler gun shoot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:24:42 - 01:24:42]** It does.

**[01:24:42 - 01:24:43]** It shoots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:24:43 - 01:24:45]** I thought it shoots darts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:24:45 - 01:24:47]** You can add injections.

**[01:24:48 - 01:24:49]** I've got a needler pistol.

**[01:24:49 - 01:24:50]** I don't have an advanced.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:24:50 - 01:24:52]** I didn't think it had an injectable property for it.

**[01:24:52 - 01:24:52]** It does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:53 - 01:24:59]** The medication can be delivered through any injection weapon or syringe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:24:59 - 01:25:01]** I was looking at the wrong thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:01 - 01:25:02]** Yep.

**[01:25:02 - 01:25:03]** So you can do that.

**[01:25:03 - 01:25:06]** Rick walks back and he's like, do we need that, though?

**[01:25:06 - 01:25:07]** And he taps the back of his axe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:25:08 - 01:25:08]** I could use it.

**[01:25:09 - 01:25:16]** And... I'm going to drop my regular needle or pistol and I'll take the advanced one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:16 - 01:25:18]** Okay, that's fine.

**[01:25:18 - 01:25:19]** As you all are...

**[01:25:20 - 01:25:22]** Colin and Dr. O.K.

**[01:25:22 - 01:25:23]** are in one med bay.

**[01:25:23 - 01:25:26]** They are swapping out, getting the injections ready.

**[01:25:27 - 01:25:29]** Hears, you are in the other med bay.

**[01:25:30 - 01:25:33]** And Rick and Kaniko, you are walking down the long hall.

**[01:25:35 - 01:25:37]** I need Bernice to give me a perception check.

**[01:25:37 - 01:25:38]** What?

**[01:25:38 - 01:25:39]** Let me load up Bernice's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:40 - 01:25:44]** The elevator doors open up and those three come charging out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:25:44 - 01:25:47]** Double check her perception.

**[01:25:48 - 01:25:48]** Fifteen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:48 - 01:25:49]** 15.

**[01:25:50 - 01:25:50]** Okay.

**[01:25:50 - 01:25:50]** All right.

**[01:25:51 - 01:25:53]** Bernice is standing there with Melt-A-Man, right?

**[01:25:53 - 01:25:54]** Or was Melt-A-Man following Rick?

**[01:25:55 - 01:25:57]** Well, Bernice was going to follow Melt-A-Man.

**[01:25:57 - 01:25:57]** Oh.
