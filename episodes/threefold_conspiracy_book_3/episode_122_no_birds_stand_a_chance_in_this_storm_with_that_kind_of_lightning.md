## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:23]** Welcome back to We'll Save the Podcast!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:26]** We'll Save the Podcast!

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:27]** What's up?

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:29]** I'm your greasy GM, Jon Swan.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:35]** Joined by my fellow greasy wrestling mates, Vinny, Kelly, Will, and Kevin.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:37]** Are you trying to color my hygiene?

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** Whoa, no, dude.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:39]** No, I think he's trying to.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:42]** You apply the grease before you color.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** No, I think he's calling it a collective hygiene.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Wow, I was not at all, dude.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** This is very hygienic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:50]** Yeah, you guys were sharing a house together.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** I don't know what your shower situation was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** You missed that part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** You swerved the whole thing, dude.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** It was all good.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** Yeah, that was great.

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:00]** We went to Gen Con, and it was fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:02]** Two weeks ago, according to the recording.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:05]** Two weeks ago, yes.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** We met in person.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:09]** But some of us had done that before, but most of us hadn't.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:09]** It was really cool.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** It was a great time.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:11]** Such a good time.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Absolute blast.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** We saw Finder in person.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** We saw Finder.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** He slapped me in the f***ing face.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:18]** Thanks, Finder.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** He did.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** Yeah.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** It wasn't funny, Finder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** I was a little concerned for you, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** I...

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:32]** The moment it happened, I was just like, okay, I guess this is when we all go to jail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** This is Blades, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:41]** At that point, if you would have stabbed him, it would have been acceptable.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** I don't know about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:48]** Indiana Law says if someone slaps you, you can just f***ing fall on nuke them.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:51]** That's appropriate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** That's not in our rules.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** It's not an addendum.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** It's not...

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:02]** It was a well-timed slap and a very ginger and nice slap.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:05]** It was just for the role-play moment, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:12]** Finder GM'd a game of Blades in the Dark for us, and we all were really hilarious characters.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** I don't know.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** Or we were hilariously named, at least.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** It was not good, actually.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** I say that sarcastically.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:21]** I thought it was good.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:24]** At one point, he slapped me in the face.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:27]** No one touches my cucumber sandwiches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:51]** i definitely would have if he did if you had made it upstairs i definitely would have oh yeah i know no one touches oh yeah who was your character will i forget the name dang it was vladimir vladimir yeah that's right yeah your russian accent was pretty good vcdc vcdc that's right i don't know i don't know uh benny you were who were you again


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** I don't remember who my character was.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** Oh, man.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:59]** We were so drunk that night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** You were like an axeman or something.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:06]** Were you the lumberjack?

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** I was the lumberjack.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Vinny was drinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Vinny was drinking.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:11]** Okay.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:12]** Now I remember.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:12]** Thank you.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]** The lumberjack.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** I was an assassin.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** That's right.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:24]** But like where the, the, I had a rival assassin who was like a firearms, like from a mile away, take you out.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:29]** He like treated them with such disdain was like, no, you're a second class assassin.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:33]** If you're going to do it, do it right up close and personal.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:39]** And so he earned the name Lumberjack because he would get in there close and then just chop them up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** You were an assassin from a horror movie is what you were.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:46]** Because no normal assassin just busts down a door and axes people to death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** But he only axes their ankles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** I was just watching Breaking Bad.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:54]** Those Mexican hombres with the axe.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:55]** That was pretty amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:58]** Yeah, they were super f***ing amazing.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** I would call them assassins.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** Yeah, for sure.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:03]** I was a clairvoyant child named Junior.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** You were frightening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** You were the most frightening character.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:09]** You sounded like a kid from a horror movie.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** Possessed by the devil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:12]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:15]** I had a Matilda moment and wrapped up some people in some rugs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:17]** Do the voice.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:20]** Do the voice so everyone can know how frightening it was for all of us.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:23]** Hi, I'm just a little satanic child.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** I'm Junior.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:29]** My father died in a concrete mixer.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** No, it was worse than that.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:32]** That's your, like, fuck skittermander voice.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** It wasn't that.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** It was way scarier than that.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:35]** Ghazi?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:36]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** It wasn't Ghazi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** It wasn't Ghazi, unfortunately.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** Kev, who are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** You were a frightening kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:47]** My character's name was Spider, and he was a born-again religious zealot.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:48]** Oh, my.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** Tell them what I told them.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:51]** Yeah.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:53]** Tell them what they want, Kev.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** Wait, what?

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** Nobody won anything.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:59]** No, no, I mean, tell them why you had to mispronounce, like, everything.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:00]** Like, remember?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:03]** Because, like, Finder was like, I don't want this woman in this shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:09]** Because I was leaning real heavy into, like, he's, like, a born-again Catholic character.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** And Finder was like, that's not the world we live in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:14]** Are there such things as born-again Catholics?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:14]** I don't know.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** I mean, like, you revitalize, whatever the word is.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:20]** He found Catholicism in prison.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** Anyways.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** Catholicism?

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** Does he worship Catholicism?

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:26]** Catholicism.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:34]** But Finder was like, this world, the sun exploded, and there are no gods, so you can't do that.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** And I was like, fine then.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:38]** He's a cross-gen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:38 - 00:07:01]** because he was the assassin who was trying to assassinate you who were who was impersonating the headmistress and it was great it was a terrible plan guys but it worked but it worked i don't know how it worked

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** We had a good time at Gen Con.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** Just want to shout out and say thanks to everyone that came out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** Thanks to everyone who played with us and spoke with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Played with us, hung out with us.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** We met all y'all.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** Yeah, it was super fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:14]** Yeah, we met some really cool folks.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:16]** A lot of the STF fans are awesome.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** We had a hangout at Tapper's.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** Everybody who came out, you guys had such a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** Met people at Find the Path.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** They were awesome.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** Both their fans on their crew, they were cool.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:29]** Five GM's crew came out.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** No quest.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** No quest was there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:34]** It was a really good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:36]** Yeah, that was cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** Got some things cooking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** Played some non-tabletop games.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** Played some Aegis.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:43]** That was a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:43 - 00:08:11]** finder and i played uh this echidna shuffle which was about getting bugs on the back of an echidna and then moving the echidnas around and i won no wait no finder won i take that back i was one step away and then finder like screwed me up and took the victory at three o'clock in the morning one night there was like a drugged out woman who like came to the door this is why i stayed in my own place and she was like i went to sleep before midnight


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:15]** Adam and Finder and I think Heath were up.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** Heath from SDF.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:19]** And then she came up and she's like, the lightning is chasing me.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:23]** I swear to God, if you don't let me in, I'm going to get struck to death by lightning.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:29]** So he called the cops and then I guess that went on for an hour before she got struck by lightning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** I'm going to need you to step off the porch.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** Yeah, something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** It was a pretty sad situation, honestly.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:38]** That's my favorite phrase ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:41]** I would tell my son that all the time.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** I'm going to need you to step off the porch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** Didn't he add a ma'am to the front of it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:51]** Ma'am, I'm going to need you to step off the porch.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** Thanks to STF, you guys were awesome.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** Not that I was there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** Actually, I was there.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** I was the old lady.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:16]** no it was great we played table board games we played a couple of new tabletop systems that you know what

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:33]** one or more of us may have bought some new games to to test run maybe we'll try we'll see just play them and see how that goes keep your ear to the will save grindstone because we got some some new and exciting maybe games coming up maybe changes to will save

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:33]** You know, who knows?

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:36]** Maybe we'll change how we do some things around here.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:40]** Watch out for the Hungry Hungry Hippos episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:40]** Yeah, that's mostly it.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** That and Crossfire.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:45]** It's going to be mostly shouting.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** It's a five-minute episode.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:49]** It's mostly just the sound of, like, balls moving.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** Along with Hungry Hungry Hippos.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** It's actually back-to-back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** Wait, we're not supposed to talk about balls in this episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** It's fine.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** Moving on.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:58]** With that, I just wanted to say...

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** Thank you to everyone.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** You were fantastic.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:04]** Even if you just liked our tweet, hanging out on Discord, heard that we do that.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:05]** It was awesome.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:09]** One thing that I want to highlight that we're not going to do it now.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:15]** We learned some cool stuff about some interesting ways to add in.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:35]** GMing like to make things move a little faster including an idea to change initiative every round just to change things up and keep the feel of combat we're not going to do it this episode but we were trying to take stock of ways that we could make the show more exciting and change it up for us as players and you as listeners so

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** We'll see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** It was a cool concept.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:42]** And the way it was explained was that everybody would roll initiative every round, and you hold your initiative.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:44]** So, like, you don't report it.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:49]** And then from there, the GM would call down, stepladder style, like, anybody above 20.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:51]** And then, okay, you go first, you go next.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** And then that way, every round, it was easy to go through the list.

**[00:10:55 - 00:11:02]** But the biggest idea was that it would randomize combat in the way that combat is randomized in reality.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Like...

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** Which is kind of a neat idea.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:07]** It's worth trying.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** It's worth trying.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** Probably not this ep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:15]** What I do want to do this ep, though, is give out a sentence.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** Because I got some sentences.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:20]** So, let's see.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** It does take you.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:25]** I'm not going to eliminate you.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** It's okay.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** It's all good.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:36]** I already got the person that I'm going to send it to, and I got the sentence in mind, and I'm going to send it to that person on Discord.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:41]** Keep your Discords open and ready.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** Except for Kev.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:44]** Except for Kev, yeah.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:46]** Unless I'm secretly not sending it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:48]** Who sent an AIM message to Kevin?

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:52]** And then I have three episodes to figure it out because that's how long it took Kelly to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:55]** Yeah, that's the grace period here.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:57]** Cool.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:02]** I'm excited to see what happens in this episode.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** So let's play.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** Let's get into it.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** You've got mail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:11]** Oh, I guess it was Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:16]** So good.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:47]** cool last week last time on we'll save the reptoid is out of the bag you all have discovered on jocks herds private computer a cache of documents that detail how nearly all of the stewards at the tier callous base stewards base on veros for a moon around leovara

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:51]** Nearly all of them have been replaced by Reptoids, except for Silverton.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:55]** And... God damn it, Silverton.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:58]** There's no excuse for him being a d*** at all.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:58]** That's just who he is.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:04]** I will reveal more about that in the plot armor.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:07]** The Peritons are not...

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:15]** Reptoids, except according to the documents, Orvier Pike, lead of the Peritons, Pike's parrot, is a Reptoid.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:21]** As soon as you find this out, you all say, let's GTFO right now.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:28]** We're opening the hangar doors, both for our vehicles and for the Periton.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** And as soon as you do, you come out.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:33]** You are telling Kaniko to go.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:37]** She comes in over the comms right before the signal jammer hits.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:46]** And she says she's freaking out because Orvier and Dr. Nodens are aboard the other starship in the starship hangar.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:49]** And they have opened fire on the Periton.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:53]** And the last thing you hear is a massive explosion.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** And then the line goes dead.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** Shay and Gnarla come out.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:12]** of the after-party room with the very old-style lodge that they're hanging out in that you think you saw maybe Silverton or Red?

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** You might have seen some other people in there.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:14]** You're not sure.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:15]** They come out.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:18]** They confront you, saying, what are you doing here?

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:21]** Rick19 has a gun trained on him.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:24]** You all start to move out towards the hangar.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:30]** You're getting out of Dodge as fast as you can, and combat starts.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:36]** and Hears, you all make it into the garage.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:50]** You are able to determine that the police cruiser and possibly the truck, although Hears and Koneko did work last night to undo and kind of wipe clean all of the security measures on it.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:53]** There were slight security measures put back on it.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** And I say slight because if you recall, Dr. O.K.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** was like, I've done this 10 million times.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:59]** And he aces the checks.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:04]** to bypass the new security measures that they had put on there, knowing that you had bypassed it last night.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:08]** So the police cruisers, I believe, are good to go.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:13]** Here's, you have come in, you are about to work on the vehicles.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:17]** Shay Dysha was fatigued.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:23]** Colin is on the floor in front of the door that's open.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** The garage is a grease spell from Gnarla.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** Colin has slipped.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** Gnarla has stepped up and said, just come with us.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:35]** You know what awaits as she magic missiles Rick 19.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:37]** Rick 19 is standing on the other side of the hall.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:39]** We have two of our crew inside the garage.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:41]** We have two of the crew in the hallway.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:52]** You hear footsteps coming from a distant hallway and you recall that Shay has asked Melteman to come by, but that's not the only reinforcements coming.

**[00:15:53 - 00:16:01]** As we ended last time with the door to the warehouse opening and the very imposing figure of


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:27]** of jocks heard standing in his power armor freaking jocks and that's where we come back i'm gonna bring you guys back to the map what is it keth what's i'm still a little upset with myself that i didn't realize that melt a man was somebody's drone until last episode i was like what the fuck i thought he was an npc which i asked you at the time like is this an npc and you were like well kind of and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:31]** I'm so upset at you for choosing violence last episode.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** What do you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** What else were you doing?

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** Hey, no, guys.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** We couldn't believe it.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:38]** Literally anything else first.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** They're going to kill you anyways, Kelly.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:41]** They're coming to kill us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:44]** The strong grasping is too great.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:48]** No, it's like standing in a straw field and just reaching out and hugging.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** It's all there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:53]** Standing in a straw field for the straw farm.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:55]** History will prove you wrong.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:58]** To be fair, they haven't said anything.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** You haven't necessarily done anything.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:03]** Again, so weird.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:06]** All that you've done is read that they are reptoids.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:08]** You haven't seen anything else.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** in this exact moment.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:13]** They haven't changed or done anything at all, but they are attacking you currently.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:17]** I believe it's the top of round three.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:21]** And I believe here is you had just ended your turn right at the truck.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** You were getting ready.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** You moved in.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:26]** I think you had slipped a bit on oil.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:26]** Then you get up.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** You move in.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** You're pulling out your tools.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** You're about to go in and check.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:34]** The timing is tight right now because there are threats coming in from the west and from the north.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:37]** And you all are trying to get up two hangar doors.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:42]** It is Inspector Jock's herd's turn at this moment.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:47]** And as the door opens, I would say Colin and Rick...

**[00:17:47 - 00:18:13]** uh-huh you hear especially here's in dr okay you might hear it he's not trying to be quiet but rick and colin you hear this low just like and he says nala shut the hangar doors let's show these party crashers some fireworks


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:14]** Oh, my God.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** I forgot they did admit that they were reckless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:26]** There is a, like... Colin and Rick, you hear this loud, like, slam as he just slams his hand into his shoulder.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:37]** And immediately, all of the light in the entire base turns red as the base has moved into some sort of state.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:41]** You're not sure what yet, but he has activated something station-wide.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** So he...

**[00:18:44 - 00:19:07]** instructed narla to close the doors yes he said narla close the hangar doors let's show these party crashers some fireworks he takes a swift action to engage some sort of switch on his armor and then with that he is going to attack colin he takes a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:09]** Wait, wait, is that not an action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:12]** It was a swift action, again, to engage his switch.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** That was a swift action.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:15]** Swift.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:18]** I'll send you the text in the book.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Swift action.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:21]** I kind of believe you.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:24]** I will send you the text in the book.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:32]** He takes his staff, raises it up, and just is trying to hammer you and stun you and stagger you.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:56]** colin colin that is going to be a 34 to hit i don't like that i don't like that one bit tpk yikes it's 22 points of damage gets absolutely hammered by this you see like mechanically his stamina is gone


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** That's all the stamina he had left.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:02]** You see, cause he's already prone in the grease.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:24]** So like you see like the hard shadows down jocks, his face and the, the, the blur of the staff come down and just, and even as he makes contacts, you see the, the, the paint chip on, on Colin's armor, but jocks keeps pressing in and that starts to crack under the pressure of the, of this staff.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:26]** Colin's hurting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** That was max damage.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** That's cool.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:31]** There's a jolt that comes through besides the slam.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:42]** There's a jolt that comes through as he's doing electrical damage as it courses through your armor and hits your nervous system, causing you to twitch briefly.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:43]** All right.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:49]** Colin, that is Jock's herd's turn.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:52]** He is not going to move just yet.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:54]** Shay.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:54]** Shay.

**[00:20:56 - 00:21:01]** reaches down, pulls out his frostbite class zero pistol.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:07]** He takes two steps forward to stand right near Colin.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:10]** And he aims it at you, Rick.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:13]** And there is just a look in his eye.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:18]** That is just a dead look, like there's nothing inside.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:22]** That is a 15 against your EAC.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** I'm assuming that's a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** That's a miss.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** Okay.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:31]** Vinny, do you have a reaction and a melee weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:34]** You know, funny happenstance.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:38]** I have both a reaction in this round and a melee weapon equipped.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:38]** Thank you.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:40]** Thank you for pointing that out, Mr. Kennedy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** Can you do a melee weapon while you're prone, though?

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** Can you take reaction while you're prone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** I believe you can.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** I don't know why you couldn't.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:52]** You'd take it at the normal disadvantages for taking a melee attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** You take a minus four penalty to melee attack rolls.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** Yeah.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** So go ahead and give me a roll if you want.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:19]** he is okay with with taking this mostly because you're on the ground prone and he uh is fine to just try and cover the exit to make sure that you are not leaving um so one of these one of the things that i got at gen con were these fancy new dice from dispel which have like this circuitry


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:40]** uh shout out to spell dice they make some really great great products they did not pay me for this i paid full price for these dice which was not a small amount but they're dope um so i'm gonna roll that to hit give me a roll baby 14 plus 7 is 21 minus 4 for being prone is a 17 to hit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:43]** 17 against what?

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** EAC or KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Against KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:46]** Oh.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:52]** You swing, and it just bangs against the wall.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:54]** You just misjudge it because of the grease.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:57]** Your elbow slides in, and you think you're about to connect.

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:01]** You're so close, and it just leaves a scratch against the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:01]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:03]** That's your reaction.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:06]** Rick19, he shot against you.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** We are now moving into Rick19's turn.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:11]** Rick, Colin is prone in front of you.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** Kears and Dr. OK are trying to get the vehicles ready.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** You have heard that they're trying to close the hangar doors.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:16]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:26]** Well, I probably wasted my attack roll, but I rolled a 19 on the die for a life science to see if reptilitoids can have any weaknesses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:29]** To see if reptoids can have any weaknesses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:30]** It's 24 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** Okay.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** To do a life science.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** Yeah.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** Okay.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:35]** Give me one sec here.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Crazy, man.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:40]** Man, this is crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:41]** Let's see.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:43]** I like it.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:49]** There are five of these guys standing here, and there are how many total?

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** Like 30?

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:54]** There's no way we could fight off 30 of these things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:56]** We need to get out of here as soon as possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** Oh, Colin's stuck on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** If you study tactics, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** Yeah, could I recommend you a book?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:05]** It's like the gates of Theropolis.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:05]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:18]** We're like... If you study tactics... It's a bottleneck, but one of our team is in the bottleneck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:23]** Yeah, so he's got to get out of the kill zone and into this open space where we can...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:26]** Whatever.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** Die in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** I don't care.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:38]** Rick19, you are trying to see if there are weaknesses for Reptoids.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:42]** Now, I do want to say this.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:45]** Reptoids in this universe are similar to greys.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:50]** The first time that you saw greys, it's like this idea that you've never actually seen them before.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:57]** Any text about Reptoids that you may have seen is likely buried in some file that was torrented.

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:03]** You all would know more about this on some off-the-wall website or dark web.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** Why would I know this?

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:34]** I'm just trying to say I don't know where like all this like you know the corners of the internet but anything that is substantial that maybe is the slightest chance verifiable exactly there's some doctor somewhere there's some official somewhere who has seen something and grabbed something that that evidence disappeared self-published yes a compendium on reptoids yes exactly exactly with that

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:38]** Kev, you said that you wanted to know if they have any weaknesses.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:51]** You would recall from just trying to look that in any form that you don't know of any weaknesses specifically that they would have, that if they were reptoids that they might have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:52]** Cool.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** So, waste of a roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:54]** Moving on.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:58]** Did you want to know, like, in general, do you want to know, like, lowest saves?

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** That's something that STF's done that I like.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** Like, what the lowest save might be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:04]** Yeah, what's their lowest save?

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:08]** Because I deal with saving throws all the time as a soldier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** Yeah, I'm just saying.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:10]** I'm just saying.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:18]** You would know that in general, reflex save tends to be the lowest in case something might need to occur.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** Keep in mind.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** Well, I don't want to say that yet.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** Okay, Kev, what do you want to do as Rick19?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:31]** So first thing that he's going to do is I think I get a two plus one for my cloud.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:33]** So let me do that.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:49]** His nanites, he's got his gun raised and pointed, but you see kind of like run down his leg and off his body kind of just disperse these nanites into a cloud that is going to pass all the way up to Colin.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** It's going to go three squares.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** Nice.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:55]** So that hallway has now got this nanite cloud that's just dispersed.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:04]** And what that does is gives me some concealment to anybody inside, but I don't think that I actually get concealment from it.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:06]** Oh, I wasn't... Sorry, I take that back.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** I wasn't going to do this because I still have the signal jammer.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** But you already used.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:15]** Right, but that... So the signal jammer is my nanite array.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:19]** If I do the cloud, I lose the signal jammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:23]** He still had the signal jammer active, correct?

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:30]** So could Inspector Heard have done his swift action to any effect?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:32]** Ooh, that is a good call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** Take it back.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Take it back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** That's so rude.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** You don't need to say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** And he couldn't even say anything to Gnarla.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** It's not like he's yelling in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** Yes, he was yelling in the hallway.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** That was the point, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:44]** Yeah, he's yelling to Gnarla on a comm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:44 - 00:28:08]** he's he's yelling to narla around the corner let's be fair yeah she's only like there's line of sight yeah that's a good shake in here but he's i can't hear because i'm in the tactically sounds garage yes he could still encounter at this switch


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:15]** If you want to try and give me an engineering check to try and see what it might be, maybe somebody can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:19]** I feel like that's a Rick thing, because Rick would be like, oh, why is this working?

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** I have a jammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:21]** Maybe.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** But is that going to cost an action?

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** Because I'm not going to waste an action to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** He also doesn't have very high engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:34]** It's more about if you want to see what this might be, like what kind of a switch might this be.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** But Rick19, what do you want to do on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** I can't see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** Oh, Kev, sorry.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:39]** I'm going to hold you up one sec.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:42]** You did say earlier, you're like, we don't know.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** There's like 30 of them.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:44]** We got to fight them.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:45]** I'll say this.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** You've heard a loud explosion.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** The line with Keniko has gone dead.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:55]** You are not sure yet what might be the state of the rest of the base.

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:00]** So I'm just giving you that for free because you're like, well, there are 30 of them.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** You're right.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** There are.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:06]** But what has happened since that explosion?

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** There were 30 at some point.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:08]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** Great.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** Do you want to stick around and find out?

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:13]** Do you want to stick around and find out?

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** Fuck no.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:16]** I'm going to shoot and move.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:21]** That's 11 on the die for a plus.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:24]** What's my to hit for that thing?

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:26]** Plus nine for 20 to hit.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** Laser.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** So on Shea.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** His name's not Shea.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** Sheatoid.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:35]** Yes.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** 20 hits.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** 20 hits.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** Yes.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** Great.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:43]** So that's going to be a D10 plus 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Okay.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:49]** While that's happening, Colin, get ready to think about what you're going to be doing next while Kev is rolling that damage.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:53]** That's 8 points of laser fire damage.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** 8 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** Okay.

**[00:29:56 - 00:30:04]** And then Rick is going to step forward, because the door is here, so I can't diagonally move the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** Where is here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:12]** Forward one square and to the right is the door I'm trying to get through.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** So Rick is going to step...

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:39]** i can't move why can't i move oh sorry it's paused my bad um so he steps forward and then into the hall so he still has colin in sight and um he can see everybody in the thing but now he's entered into the garage across the hall from the three in the warehouse um does dr inspector heard get a aoa


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:44]** I was just going to say, unless the thing is that I think you could probably move diagonally across, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** Even though that's an argument.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:53]** I mean, he's trying to, I guess you do have to go around the wall, huh?

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** That's the problem.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:56]** You can't just like step through the space of the wall.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** If you don't want to take your AOL, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:02]** No, I will take an AOL against you.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** That is not a problem.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:07]** That is going to be a 27.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:10]** That's a hit.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:15]** That is 19 points of damage.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** Sorry, 21 points of damage.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:17]** Sorry, 20.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:19]** I'm so... I'm sorry.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:19]** I'm sorry.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** I promise.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** I'm just going to not take anything if you can't be honest.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** That's fine.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:23]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:26]** I'm just... The math was not math in my head.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:28]** So you fire this blistering shot.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:30]** You step up, move around.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:34]** The shot hits Shay, and then...

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:42]** Out of the corner of his eye, Joxherd sees you, pivots, swings up, and hits you with his stun staff on your way in.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Just slaps you on the butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:50]** And then as he steps to the door, he's going to tell Dr. O'Kane here, he's like, we got incoming, and Colin is down.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** Like, down, down?


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:52 - 00:32:14]** he's on the ground he's on the ground i don't play i haven't i haven't been able to check his titles okay colin's down great we're seeing if we can get these unlocked apparently they've been firewalled so yeah well this one is unlocked but this is all combat banter that uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** That's happening mid-combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:20]** Besides that, Gears doesn't say anything because he's still kind of angry.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** So he's just kind of focusing on his work.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:23]** Colin, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Angry at what, Kelly?

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** Angry at what?

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:26]** Let's not talk.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:28]** He doesn't want to talk about it.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:31]** There's seven f***ers trying to kill us currently.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** You think it's my fault?

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:35]** That's the entire situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:53]** yeah uh-huh here's doesn't make any comments there's no comments cool cool cool colin stands up and be simple yes which is one move action yep he's gonna use his second move action to uh try to get through this other square of grease and into the garage


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:57]** And there's no reactions there.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** Thank you, GM Kev.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** There's no reaction.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:03]** And because Jock's herd has spent his and also Shay is only using a ranged weapon.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** Welcome, Colin.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** Correct.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:10]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Shut the door.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:14]** Shut the door.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:14]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:15]** Are you trying?

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** So you move only 10 feet in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** I would like to move farther in.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:21]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** You have 30 feet after you stand up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:23]** Yeah.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:27]** Yeah, but I have five feet of difficult terrain because of the rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:28]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** I don't think Kelly is prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:33]** Oh, don't you need to do acrobatics when you pass through that square?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:33]** I don't know.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** That's what I was waiting for John to tell me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** Ah, you are right.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:41]** That would be what you need to do because you moved through the one square.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:45]** Yep, that's why I had the grease spell up in my tab.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** Give me an acrobatics check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:48]** Sorry, I shouldn't have said anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:48]** Nope, it's cool.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:50]** Yeah, you totally reminded me.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:51]** GM test.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:55]** What are you doing?

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** That's a dirty 20 on acrobatics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Nailed it.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:58]** You're good.

**[00:33:59 - 00:33:59]** You're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:04]** So you move up to half speed through that, and then you can move your full speed the rest of the way?

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:04]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:07]** Oh, she's dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:13]** I'm going to metagame, and I'm going to stay right here.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** Okay.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** He's going to metagame and stay right there.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:17]** Move through enemy squares.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:22]** So I'm going to help Rick barricade the door because I don't have a third action to close the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:23]** Oh.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:24]** Hold on.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** Hold on.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** Hold on.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:34]** We're both like, hold on to a double wide open door.


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:35]** Amazing.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:38]** Dr. K, what do you want to do?

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** Colin and Rick are holding the door.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:45]** There's a threat outside and you nailed one of the checks.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** And I think you're about to.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** What do you want to do with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:52]** I'm going to instruct Bernice.

**[00:34:52 - 00:35:00]** to move the vehicle forward in order to jam the doors potentially.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** Okay.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:03]** That's one free action.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:06]** And Bernice is in the car.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:06]** She's in the car.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** This one's already hot, wired to go.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** This one's hot to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:16]** This one's hot to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:18]** All right, so you move it forward five feet.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:23]** She slams on the accelerator with her little briefcase feet.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:24]** Yeah.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:26]** With her briefcase feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:31]** A little arm reticulates out and she pushes, depresses the gas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** First she puts the knife away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:37]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:37]** The gun.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** All right.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:39]** I love it.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:17]** With my next action, I'm going to hit... Colin, are you into your HP?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** I'm great on the cusp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** Okay, never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:27]** Good talk.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** Thanks for that.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:35]** I'm going to hit Rick with a basic booster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** That will give you...

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:41]** An enhancement to your AC.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:42]** Okay.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Amazing.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:49]** And then I'm going to move over to the... So I'm going to fire that from here.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:52]** And then I'm going to move over to the other car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:53]** Okay.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** Awesome.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** Awesome.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:56]** Badass.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** Helping out your teammates.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:02]** Trying to set up a little barricade for the door so it doesn't completely close.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** It's getting tense.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:09]** You all are here and Dr. K are doing work and Rick and Colin are stopping the gap.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:10]** Anything else?

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:14]** I think that's all your movement, Dr. K. Yeah, that's all I can do.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Awesome.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:17]** Man, you guys are working synchronously.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** You're killing it.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:20]** Okay.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:22]** It is Gnarla's turn.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:52]** Rick and Colin, you are out of line of sight, but you hear running of footsteps, and then a few minutes later, and by minutes, I mean less than six seconds later, you hear the sound of the hangar doors start to screech and come back to life as they are now beginning to move down the wall to close.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:56]** And I will say that, judging by the speed, this is pretty easy to see.

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:02]** You all will have four rounds to get out before it closes.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** Okay.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:06]** Hmm.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** That is her turn.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:09]** Cool.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Built a man.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Built a man.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** Start thinking about your turn.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:17]** Some other things are going to happen at the moment.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:21]** Okay.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:22]** Okay.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:33]** Rick and Colin, you do hear the do-do-do-do-do and just thump-thump-thump of Melt-A-Man as Melt-A-Man is moving very quickly.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:43]** And Rick, you can probably see that Melt-A-Man's comic book form comes up behind Shay and is ready to take action.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** They seem like they were hustling, moving very quickly.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:45]** Kelly, your question.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:48]** John, we're whitelisted in Melt-A-Man's...

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** commands.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:54]** That is a great thing that you have reminded me of.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** Okay.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:55]** Just letting you know.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Thank you.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:56]** And everyone else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** Thank you for that tidbit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** Thank you for that tidbit.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:04]** Just reminding you, here's made it so you all can command him.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Just heads up.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** Did they reprogram him?

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** Let's not ask that question.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:12]** Let's just say that we're waitlisting.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** I don't want to cut fate here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** Alright.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:37]** rick from behind jock's herd comes the form of sylvania and there's just a her her silent self there's a smile that comes across her lips as she walks up and she swings at you with her hook sword let's see what happens

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:41]** That is going to be a 26 to hit you.

**[00:39:41 - 00:40:02]** That's 12 points of damage as this hook sword just lacerates part of your arm and part of your shoulder, like your upper arm between your elbow and your shoulder, and you just feel some of the muscle just get torn out and chunks of it fly onto the garage floor.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:08]** What happens next?

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:12]** You see Colin and Rick.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:18]** You see this small figure of a gnome move up next to Jock's herd.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:24]** And they are going to take a shot at you, Colin.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:30]** They're probably going to have soft cover because of Sylvania.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:31]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:34]** Which will give me a what again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:36]** Plus four, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:39]** A plus four to... I think soft cover is four.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:46]** Soft cover is going to be a plus four to AC, but no bonus to AC.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:46]** All right.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:49]** That's going to be still, unfortunately, a 29 to you.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** EAC or KAC?

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:55]** That is going to be a good question.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:56]** As if it matters.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** I know.

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:10]** You're going to take seven points of damage as this purple blue ray in rings just shoots out and hits you.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:16]** And you feel this slight sting as if the damage was doing this fire damage.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:18]** And there's a little bit of acid in there, too.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:30]** It's a dangerous weapon as it starts to even further mar and tarnish your armor that's already been dented and hit and scraped as you've taken the brunt of a lot of attacks here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:35]** Yeah, the scent of acrid skin starts to fill the hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** Yeah.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** Let's see.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:46]** Here's what are you going to do at the end of the round here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:51]** Here's didn't get to do his check last round.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** He was just preparing for it.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** So he's going to have to do it on this car, right?

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:56]** Because he's locked still, essentially.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** So he has to spend...

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:07]** Now, being the rules friendly person that I am, I have a special PDF, which shows that skill checks take an entire standard action.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:14]** So he's going to have to only do that this round, which will be a computers or engineering either or.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** Yeah, I'd say it's either or.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:18]** Computers it will be then.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** Roll well.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** 21.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:23]** Okay, 21.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:24]** Let's see.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Come on, baby.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Come on, baby.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** Unlock for me.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** We went through so much last night.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:30]** I don't want to redo this all over again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** Dr.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:34]** O.K., I believe last time you rolled something really high, right?

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** Like a 27.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** You crushed it with your roll last time.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** Yeah, it was pretty high.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** Here's you feel like...

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:46]** You feel like you're almost there, but it just doesn't quite work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:50]** What does he sense needs to be done exactly?

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:55]** It's just that we're no longer whitelisting the system so we can't drive it or it's locked up or like what's happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:58]** You sense that there's been like you had everything ready to go.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** This vehicle in particular, the truck was already ready to go.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:02]** Like the keys are just like in there ready to go.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:06]** It's just now it's any input that you go to try and start it and get it set up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:31]** there's a there's a block on the computer that's preventing it from uh from the uh engine from engaging and being able to be driven got it thank you thank you uh doctor can you give me some uh assist i don't know if he's free right now are you free right now i was trying to work on this one well he can assist on my i don't know if he can do it from where he is but could you it's the red one with this it's the red one

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:58]** does he assist with uh i should have asked earlier can i i mean i automatically assist on engineering yeah so yeah i'd say that check that that that he can do that for free because he's already done that so next time that you do it you'll you'll get a plus two that's fine but so i can't do it on a 23 now right uh well no because you need to roll again you already went and did it once yeah yeah yeah all right all right hands off the chess piece that's fine whatever it was a it was a whole standard action we're not playing chess though


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:03]** I do like the image that here's you're like, you're running up, you're rushing.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:05]** You're like, you're trying to pull out your tools.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** Something drops, you grab it.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:09]** You're, you're trying to put it in and it just doesn't work.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** And like you asked Dr. Okay.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** For help.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:11]** And Dr. Okay.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** It's like done this once already.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** You've done this a million times.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** You're like, don't forget.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** It's the red wire.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** You know, it's cool.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** That's cool.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Okay, anything else you want to do with your turn here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** Hold the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** Hold the door.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** And remember... Hold the door!

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:27]** He telepathically says this.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:28]** I don't know.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:31]** I don't think they'll be able to... Telepathically.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** Yeah, so I got to flip a coin.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:41]** But basically, he's going to be like, all right, everyone, remember that Meltaman has our... We're whitelisted in his system so we can give him commands.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Actually, maybe he can do that now.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:47]** So I'm going to try to get Meltaman to help out.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Hopefully they didn't overwrite him.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** What are you going to do?

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** He's just going to tell Meltaman.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** I think we normally communicate with him through comms.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** That's how we've done it in the past.

**[00:44:56 - 00:45:01]** He's going to be like, all right, Meltaman, I need you to spray some fire down that hallway.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:03]** I want you to try to take out Sylvania.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Colin and Rick are holding the door.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** Signal jammer.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** I want you to shoot Sylvania.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** Shoot Sylvania and whoever's in that hallway.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:11]** Fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** That's what I was thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** Signal jammer still active.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:40]** but we can audit like he can hear us you could shout it maybe you could you could can i telepathically talk to melty man can he pick up on that that's a good question yeah i don't think he's he's quite there he's a construct he's he's a construct so i don't think he shouts melty man shoot down the hallway shoot down the hallway whoever's there whoever's there except for rick and colin but they're not in the hallway so whoever's there right now just to clarify


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:45]** But don't hit Rick and Colin, but whoever is there, go ahead and fire.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:45]** Amazing.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:47]** I think Sylvania's there.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Shoot straight, shoot true.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:53]** It's the top of round four.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:57]** We will see what happens with Melted Man when it gets to Melted Man's turn.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:01]** As you told him to fire down the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:05]** The hallway with the oil stuff, just letting you know.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:05]** It's grease.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:13]** I'm just waiting for Kaniko to take her dying step into the hallway and Melt-O-Man is like, affirmative!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:20]** Colin has been through so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:23]** I can't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:26]** It's like that scene from Acolyte, but it's like three holes just go through.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:29]** Can you go right in front of you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:30]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** I did it!

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:32]** I'm Meltaman!

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:36]** Happy to assist!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:41]** You're safe now, citizen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:44]** Inspector Joxford takes a step forward, Colin.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** Doesn't.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:48]** He's got to do an acrobatics check.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** He does.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** He doesn't slip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:53]** He falls on his butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** Whoops.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** He's just too OP.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** Crisscross applesauce style.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:02]** No, he stays upright and sturdy like the bad ass that he is.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:13]** And Rick and Colin, you just hear him continuing to just laugh and says, I knew my number was up when you stepped off that ship.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:19]** And then he just tries to slam Colin again with the stun staff.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:21]** Colin, that's a 27 to hit.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** Oh, my God.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:26]** He's a mech of a human or whatever he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:28]** That long creature thing.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:28]** Real bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:35]** 17 more electric damage as it courses and arcs through your body.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Yeah, bro.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** You all right, bro?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Do you need some help?

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:43]** I mean, he's about toasted.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:47]** He's got 13 hit points.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:50]** What's it going to be?

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** Zero stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:53]** Rick19, start thinking about what you want to do.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:57]** Your turn is coming up in just a few minutes here.

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:04]** That is Inspector Joxherd saying that he knew his number was up when you all stepped off the ship.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** His number was up means he's going to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:08]** Isn't that what that means?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:14]** Shay says, Meltaban, hey, I'm glad you're here.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:17]** Take out...

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:40]** the survivors melt a man override that command take out not the survivors take out take out especially her survivors amazing amazing shay is going to take a step forward into the grease as well let's see what happens as he steps in

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:47]** steps, face plants, falls prone onto the ground.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** Foiled by my own spell.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** He falls onto the ground.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** It is Rick19's turn.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** There's chaos and pandemonium.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:57]** How long does it take for the grease to dissipate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:00]** It is one minute per level, so it's there for a while.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:03]** Rick Hears and Dr. O.K.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** are working furiously behind you to get things out.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:12]** You are literally holding up four people, three and one who's burned on the ground, from getting into the garage.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** Colin is almost dead.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** The pressure's on.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:24]** He's got this artillery laser up on his shoulder, and he just drops it over his back and reaches for his axe, and he's going to swing on Hurd.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:50]** so that's going to be a 11 to hit so he's going to miss that and then as he does that so he misses with Hurd and then he's going to hit the and he probably misses because he's distracted trying to shut the door so he pushes with his move action he's going to push the button to shut those two doors amazing I like where you're going with this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:51]** You swing.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:56]** It like slams into the metal above the door.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** You clearly miss.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:02]** And you see their eyes watching as it's about to come down and hit Hurd.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** And then it's like a little bit of like an Arya Stark.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** You're like, oh, but what's this hand doing?

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** Boom.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:08]** Hit the door.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** Door shuts.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:10]** Awesome.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:11]** Awesome.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:14]** The door is shut for a second.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:17]** Colin, we're sorry, Rick, do you want to do anything else?

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Push, push, push, push, push, push.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:21]** Guys, guys, open the door, open the door.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:23]** Rick, do you want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** That's my full turn.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** You moved in standard action.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** Yep, yep, yep.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:28]** Oh, Colin, what are you doing?

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:28]** Dr.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** O.K., get ready.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:30]** You're coming up next.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** Colin, what's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:34]** Out of curiosity, is there... Jam the door.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:38]** Oh, I actually really like that.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** I'm going to jam the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:43]** Bro, you have 13 hit points and you're going to jam the door.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:45]** I don't think I can jam the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** I don't have engineering.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Do you have engineering?

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:48]** I don't have computers.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** No.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:49]** Yeah.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** You have physical science?

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:50]** No.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Shame.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:54]** I'm going to get the F word out of there.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:59]** Is it an action to get into one of these vehicles or is it a swift action?


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:59 - 00:50:59]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** Bernice got the one running.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** I'm going to get this one up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:02]** John.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:03]** Sir.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:07]** Is it an action to get into the vehicle or can I just like walk up and get in?

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** That's a great question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Action to enter vehicle.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:13]** I'm going to defer to the rules here real quick.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** Just going to do a quick check.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:19]** I would think that it would just be part of your move action.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** If you just want to go and get in, you can't.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:25]** You can board or disembark from a vehicle as a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:32]** I feel like if we are to use Unknown Treasures as an example, then I guess it's a double move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:36]** Okay, so you double move, getting into the police cruiser.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:45]** I would move your character up one, Vinny, because the map vehicle that you see there is just the placeholder vehicle, and I put in the much cooler tokens that were there.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** Yeah, so you run.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:47]** You book it.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** The door's shut.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** You're hobbling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:52]** Yep, I'm in there with Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** Hey, Bernice.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:55]** Bernice is in the front seat.

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:00]** Just salutes you as you come inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:00]** Amazing.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:04]** She's holding the wheel with a little... Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:06]** Melt-A-Man's here.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:08]** Melt-A-Man's taking over Bernice.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:11]** Dr. K, what is going on with your turn?

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** You aided here's last time.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** You're face down in the vehicle.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** Oh, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:22]** Sorry, you gave him... So I'm going to...

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** I'm going to try and get this one started.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** Okay.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** Give me a computers or engineering check.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Face down in the vehicle.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** You did it in one.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** I think you'll get a plus two.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** That's fine.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:35]** I think you get a plus two because you've already done it in one vehicle.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:38]** That's a pretty easy yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:43]** That is a 19 on the die plus 13 engineering.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** Plus two.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** Nailed it.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** I think I crushed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** You don't even look.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** You're like, yep, I know that wire.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:51]** Cut it.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** Put in a little code.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:58]** Send a little fuck you all message to all the other computers and the entire base.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:01]** And then the vehicle comes to life.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** The odometer's rev.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** Everything's ready to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** And I hop in.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:06]** And you hop in.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** Let's get the fuck out of Dodge.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:12]** No birds stand a chance in this storm with that kind of lightning.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** Nice.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** Nice.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:16]** Thanks, Adam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** Hey, there it is.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** There it is.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:22]** Nailed it with the saying, with the quip.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** Yes.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Oh, that's good.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:24]** I love that.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:25]** Thank you, Adam.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Appreciate you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** That is really good.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:36]** Thank you for choosing something that can be used in an episode as opposed to, like, I really want to put chicken in my mouth or, like, I am a puppet or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** You could have used I am a puppet a little better.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Amazing.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** Good stuff.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** Okay.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** The doors begin to move.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** So you said it was four rounds.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:50]** Right.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** This is the first round since it happened.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** So they move down.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** The doors start moving down.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** The pressure is on.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:06]** Some things happen while I need hears to start thinking about what you're going to be doing on your turn.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:11]** The door is shut so you all don't know what happens next.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** Give me one sec here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** Okay.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** Gnarla's closing.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:18]** Okay.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** Melt-A-Man, Aspiring.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:25]** He's like, I can't go against my programming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:27]** You open the door and they're all dead.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:29]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** Whoa, Melt-A-Man.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:33]** Melt-A-Man just... I saved you, citizen.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:37]** Bro, Melt-A-Man, if he does that... Melt-A-Man, initiate self-destruct.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:41]** Kaniko steps out and blows her head off, too.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** Oh, my God.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** I've saved you again.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:48]** Interesting.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:49]** Okay, cool.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:55]** Rick 19, you're standing there, and the door opens again.

**[00:54:55 - 00:55:03]** And you see this, like, the visage of this, like, blue psychokinetic, blue and green psychokinetic hand that has pushed the button.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:13]** And if you look down the hall, you see that Gnarla has joined in the line of fire that is just, like, right down the hallway there in a straight line.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** It is Melt the Man's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** Who happens to have a line weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** Oh, I wish.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:27]** I think this is best solved just out in the open with a chance die.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:34]** Because I'm just going to tell you, I don't think that they did too much to fight against that.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:39]** To reprogram...

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:42]** There wasn't much done.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:46]** So I think this is just best done as a chance die because I think this is so dope.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** If this happens, this is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** Who has a line weapon?

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:50]** Melt-A-Man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** Who has a line weapon?

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** F***ing Melt-A-Man.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:56]** Okay.

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:59]** Melt-A-Man.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:04]** You hear Rick19, and maybe he hears.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:07]** You hear, I am coming for you, citizen!

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:17]** And then there's a shout as Gnarla screams, like, as there has been an attack on Gnarla.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:22]** And you see her turn around, Rick, and look at Melt the Man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** Ass still smoking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:31]** It was a very slight hit because Meltaman just went for it and missed.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:34]** But Meltaman is currently antagonizing Gnarla.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** Good job, Meltaman.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:37]** Keep doing that.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:38]** All right.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:44]** Rick, Sylvania is going to... Oh, I know what she's going to do.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** She is going to take...

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:52]** She's going to incur an attack of opportunity from you, and she's going to try and run past you.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:58]** So give me an A-O-O if you have a reaction with a melee weapon out with your axe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:03]** That's an eight plus seven for 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** It misses.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:11]** You swing where she used to be as she runs all the way over to the wall moving.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:13]** Let me just make sure that I'm moving the right amount of feet.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:15]** That is... What is going on here?

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** That is 20 feet.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:23]** She runs over and here she is going to...

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:52]** along the way she she went and hooked you rick 19 and along the way she is going to drop her sword pull out the same weapon that you saw baxter trying to shoot at colin and she's going to shoot it this pusher decoupler against all that she's dropping yeah because she's just dropping the weapon she's just moving as fast as she can that's a 24 to hit you here's getting the car well i'm pretty sure that hits john uh yeah it does


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:55]** Yeah, that's seven points of damage.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** Thanks, Orgot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** How much damage?

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** Seven points of damage.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:17]** Not much because she runs and just is like and then kind of like slams into the wall and uses that to steady her aim and then takes a shot as this blue and green or this purple and blue ring just comes out and just encompasses the upper half of your body.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:21]** Again, you feel the heat and the burning of the acid.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** Starting to mark your shitty armor.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** I'm joking.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** Joke, joke, joke.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:30]** Shots fired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:33]** Kasatha Microcord 1.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:33]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:34]** Let's see.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:36]** Okay.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** Baxter.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:38]** Kev, what you reading?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** The core rule book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:42]** You know, just a casual read.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:45]** Get ready to decide what you're going to do next.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:51]** Baxter is going to... He doubles down.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:53]** You see him check the weapon.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** Think about it.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:55]** Breathe.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** Steady his shot.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** He's going for a crit.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:05]** Because I'll just tell you as a little fun note, this pusher decoupler has a pretty bad ass critical.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:08]** And he is taking his full shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** Who's attacking who now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:11]** Baxter is attacking you, Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** Which one is Baxter?

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:12]** I don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:15]** The gnome with the purple hair that's right in front of you.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** Natural 20.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** Are you kidding me?

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:20]** No.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:21]** No.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** Okay.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** Oh, my God.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** 800 points of damage.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** No, it's not.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:29]** It's not.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** It's not.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** I have five stamina.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:37]** 12 points of fire damage hit you.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:41]** You feel another...

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:47]** One point of acid damage that burns a hole in your armor.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:55]** That's one of the critical effects from the weapon.

**[00:59:56 - 01:00:00]** So there's 12 points of damage plus one acid.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** So 13, yep.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** One acid, 12 points of fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:06]** But the acid damage is going to continue after this turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** Yeah, it's corrode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:10]** So it's going to remove an AC point.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** Right?

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:12]** Or no?

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** Is that what Kuro does?

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:13]** I don't know.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:14]** Massive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Let's find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** Shouldn't you know before you use it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:21]** I should, but I just have a lot of other tabs open, and now I'm opening it.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:24]** It functions... Let's see.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:28]** It functions the same as the burning condition, but deals acid rather than fire.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:30]** So every turn, you'll take one point of damage.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** Here's the thing.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** Uh-huh.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:36]** Okay, one sec.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** It's going to double attack.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:42]** Oh, Rick 19.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** Let me just check something here.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:46]** I'm really having to dig deep.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:51]** This is the one thing that I didn't think would happen, but I was hoping would happen.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:53]** Rick 19.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:55]** You are level five, right?

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:57]** Okay.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:59]** I don't like where this questioning is going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** Okay, great.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:05]** Part of the critical effect for the pusher decoupler is a demoralize.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:10]** So he got a free check to demoralize you and cause you to be shaken.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:14]** And you very clearly are not even thinking about it as...

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:41]** he has fired at you and then you just see this like wicked smile come over his face as it seems like his features like seem to just be larger than his face as he's trying to just like intimidate you and you are not even thinking about it it absolutely fails to intimidate you but maybe inside you're shaking like flavor you're shaking a little bit but mechanically you're not shaking okay i already clicked shaken on my

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:41]** No, no, no, no.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:42]** You're not.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:42]** You're not.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:42]** You're not.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** But he's trying.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:46]** He nailed the critical hit on you.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** Here's what are you going to do?

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:49]** Dr. K's in the car.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** Collins in the car.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** Bernice is in the car.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:54]** Rick 19 is standing up against three of these stewards.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** The door is starting to close.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:57]** Sylvania is on your ass.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:00]** There's a couple of things that one could do.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:03]** How many how many seats are in each of the smaller cars?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:22]** uh there are two i believe let me double check yeah in the police cruiser which is really odd how are you gonna arrest some perp yeah i thought it might be four yeah i thought it was four and then black two in the lower ones eight in the upper one i had i had the notes here somewhere

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:25]** I thought it was six.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** Uh, it's one.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:27]** So there's three seats.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:32]** There's one in front and then two like seats in the back for the police cruiser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:32]** Smaller ones.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:33]** Okay.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** So we could do that.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:35]** Um, okay.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:42]** So if we run to the smaller cruisers, we can obviously get out of here quicker, but then they might have access to this big guy.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** So that could be a problem.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:49]** Which seats seven, which seats seven, which is problematic.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:49]** Um,

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:55]** Now, what I want to do is basically get in the car, lock the door, right?

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:57]** Because I can still get in, you know what I mean?

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** Like, even if I can't activate it.

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:01]** But I'm trying to see if I can do that in one move action.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:03]** I'm reading the PDF, and I think I can.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** But, yeah.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:06]** You're trying to.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:10]** And then I'm going to.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:10]** Exactly.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:11]** That's what I'm going to do.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:12]** Okay.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:14]** So he just wants to open the door, get inside, lock it.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** That'll be his move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:16]** Okay.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** You get inside.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:18]** Well, lock it.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:20]** And then you want to try and start the vehicle, right?

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:21]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:21]** Correct.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:22]** Yeah.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:23]** But first he's just going to get inside, lock the door.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:26]** So sounds like we're good with that.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:29]** So then what he's going to do is he's going to be like, all right, baby, come on.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:30]** You can do this.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:31]** You got this.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:32]** You got this.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:35]** Yep.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:37]** It is but a 16.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:40]** He says locked safely inside the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:44]** That was with a plus two from... And then, yeah.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:45]** Yeah, it doesn't fucking matter.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** Okay, okay, okay.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** All right.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:47]** It's a 16.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** You get in.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:49]** It's still not working.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]** It's such a cinematic moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:55]** You're like... Come on, come on, come on.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:57]** This is my specialty.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:59]** Are there weapons in the car?

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:01]** Not that he can use them, but he's curious.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:06]** Is it suited with weapons on this vehicle for firing lasers or something like that, Joe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:13]** You want to try and use the vehicle next round to fire against... He wants to know if it's possible and where they might be if they do exist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:14]** Okay.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** Would he know?

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:17]** He did work on this car last night.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:20]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** He did work on the car.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:24]** Are there weapons in this vehicle?

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:28]** I do not believe that there are weapons in the vehicle.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:29]** No, there's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:31]** There's no secret Gatling gun?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:33]** In an all-terrain transport, no.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:35]** Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe there is not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:37]** Does the police cruiser have any weapons in it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:39]** Does the police cruiser have any weapons in it?

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:43]** It has an auto-disabler on it.

**[01:04:43 - 01:05:06]** which does 3d8 electricity and with two ammo like a like a crowd control type weapon yeah like trying to take out other vehicles oh like yeah yeah like power it damages only vehicles so yeah yep well that's all he can really do i'm afraid okay let's keep going here oh sorry dr k


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** I mean, Heroes would know that, right?

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:09]** Because he worked on these cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** Sure, yeah, he would.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:11]** Totally.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:12]** Repeat, repeat, what he knows?

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:12]** I'm sorry, I was reading something.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:15]** That there's an auto-disabler on the police cruisers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:22]** Yeah, we could make our escape in these police cruisers and fight it out in the vehicles with these bad boys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:27]** You are in the vehicle, and Rick does need a home vehicle to jump into.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:31]** And if you take all three, they can't follow you, as far as we know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:34]** But if we take the two police cruisers...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:40]** We have a planet-side car chase scene, which is fine and cool.

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:42]** But I can't do it this round anyway.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:44]** He's got to wait until the next round before he moves anyway.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:46]** So he might as well try again, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:47]** Okay.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:49]** Okay.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:50]** It's round five.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:51]** Round five.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:54]** I say we go a little long here because this is intense.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:57]** Uh, it's jocks hurts turn at the top of the round.

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:01]** Jocks hurt steps over next to you, Rick.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:05]** He's going to take a, uh, just a, Nope.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:07]** He's just taking a normal step.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** Not a, or sorry.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:11]** A quick guarded step.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** Oh, yep.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:14]** Yep.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:14]** Oh, sorry, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:16]** I think I already wasted my eye on something else.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]** So fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:21]** Well, it's the top of the new round, right?


## Speaker_0

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:21]** So, uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:32]** Steps up, calm as a cucumber, smiling, at ease with the situation that is around him as he swings to hit you for a 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** Okay.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:36]** How much damage did he do?

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:36]** 30?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:38]** Exactly 30?

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:39]** 13 electricity damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:50]** And as he hits you, he says, You were supposed to be the link, but I think you're going down with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:55]** As the electricity is just jolting and arcing through your body.

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:57]** It's Shea Dyche's turn.

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:59]** Shea turns around and says, melt the man.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:02]** Stop what you're doing and attack Rick 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:05]** He can't though because he's whitelisted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:09]** He has some conflicting messages going on right now.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:11]** And as Shay says that, Shay is also prone.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:14]** So he's going to use a move action to stand up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:16]** Kelly, I'm going to argue.

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:24]** I don't know what you're going to do, but like if you're whitelisted, I feel like it's going to have to take some kind of computers or engineering check to not.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:29]** Yeah, because like you can make commands and I can understand the conflicting commands.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:31]** But to undo a whitelist is something else.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:33]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:44]** Good thing you already suggested what I was going to do, which was stand up, and he's trying to move over to Melt-A-Man to reconstruct Melt-A-Man right now because he cares about Melt-A-Man more than he cares about himself.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:46]** So he steps up, steps past Carla.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:50]** This Reptoid cares about his victims.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:54]** He hasn't turned into a Reptoid, so you're not sure yet, but he is going to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:55]** Oh, he's not a Reptoid?

**[01:07:56 - 01:08:01]** He was on the list of Reptoid replacements, so... To be replaced or already replaced?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:03]** I thought he already was replaced.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:06]** Rick19, what would you like to do with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:09]** Jock's standing right next to you.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:13]** I'm taking a huge risk here, because I need my laser, my artillery laser.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:23]** Because I could just do a withdrawal and run for it, but I dropped my weapon, so Rick is going to reach down and pick up his weapon.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:24]** That's his move action.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:25]** Okay.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:25]** Okay.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:28]** And then he's going to run to the car.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:34]** And by run, I mean take his, like... Oh, it's a move actually to get into the car anyways.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:35]** Yes, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:35]** F***.

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:37]** I'm f***ed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:40]** F*** this game.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:42]** me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:44]** Get to the car at least.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:46]** Get to the chopper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:48]** Get to the car.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:48]** I'm leaving my gun.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:50]** He drops his gun.

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:56]** I'm going to take an AOL and I'm going to run to the car and then use my second action to get into the car.

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:57]** Which car?

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:59]** The one that Dr. O.K.

**[01:08:59 - 01:08:59]** is driving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:02]** You slide back into the vehicle with Dr. O.K.

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:04]** Do you want to take your AOL?

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:05]** Yes, of course.

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:07]** That might put me down.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:09]** I only have 17 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:11]** It's a double.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:16]** I was going to say take a guarded step and then move, but then you can't get in the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:17]** That's a 33 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:18]** Of course, yeah.

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:19]** I wasn't even going to question that.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:22]** How much damage do you do, though?

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:23]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:25]** Rick is down.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:27]** Rick is down.

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:29]** But he doesn't make it to the car in that case, then, I'm guessing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:31]** No, he doesn't even make it five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:35]** You start to turn and move away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:38]** He just hits you on the back.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:39]** Dr. K out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:43]** Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:44]** 21 minus five is how much?

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:44]** 16.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:49]** Then I'm going to use my nanosite surge.

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:51]** You have one available to use?

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:52]** To do defensive dispersal.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:53]** Yep.

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:53]** Nice.

**[01:09:54 - 01:09:55]** So that's five points off.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:56]** Oh no, it's only three points.

**[01:09:56 - 01:09:56]** Fuck.

**[01:09:56 - 01:09:58]** That was my other character that had five points.

**[01:09:59 - 01:10:00]** Uh, yeah, that's three points of damage off.

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:01]** It doesn't do anything.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:01]** It's 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:02]** That's 18.

**[01:10:03 - 01:10:05]** Dr. K out of the side mirror.

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:09]** You see Rick 19 face first hit the ground.

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:11]** He's prone and unconscious.

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:13]** Fuck dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:19]** Uh, I mean, okay, can I apply this remotely?

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:21]** I just want to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:23]** Colin Edenbrand, it's your turn.

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:25]** You're in the vehicle with Bernice.

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:28]** Maybe you also see this out of the rearview mirror.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:37]** Colin sees this and immediately closes his eyes and you notice that his skin and the cracked angel wings on his armor start to glow.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:39]** Mm-hmm.

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:48]** He uses something called Healing Channel and spends one resolve point to heal.

**[01:10:49 - 01:10:53]** He gets a pool of...

**[01:10:54 - 01:11:15]** 4d8 to use with uh because i'm using it as a full action and spending a hit point to do it uh excuse me a resolve point to do it i can heal from that pool all allies within 30 feet oh which means wait it's an ao automatically because i get some health as well

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:16]** It's an AO.

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:18]** He is exactly 30 feet away from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:19]** No, not AO.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:20]** Sorry.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:21]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:22]** That's what I meant.

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:23]** Exactly 30 feet away.

**[01:11:23 - 01:11:26]** The stakes couldn't be higher and you did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:26 - 01:11:28]** Except I rolled like dog s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:29]** He's up.

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:29]** It don't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:31]** How much HP do we get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:34]** I have a pool of 10 to spend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:35]** I'll spend it all on him.

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:38]** This is your standard action, right?

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:40]** No, he's doing a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:41 - 01:11:42]** He's just in the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:42 - 01:11:43]** Right, but it's on his turn.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:44]** It's not like it's a reaction.

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:47]** I'm still going to have to go through initiative.

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:49]** I'm not getting out of here alive.

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:50]** We'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:51]** You'll be not dead.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:53]** Yeah, dude.

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:55]** So that's ten hit points to Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:56 - 01:11:59]** Ten hit points to Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:00]** That's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:02]** That's your turn, Dr. O'K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:03]** It is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:34]** nice the pressure is pretty high you three are in vehicles rick rick 19 has just regained consciousness with hurt on his tail sylvania in the garage what what do you do uh dr okay it's gonna open the door see the sort of aura feel it although he has full stamina and hit point sure um and he is going to open the door and i just want to make sure i'm getting it right

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:47]** I think he's going to shoot his needler pistol at our good inspector with harrying fire, I think.

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:49]** Or covering fire.

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:49]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:55]** Harrying fire reduces their AC and covering fire gives AC to somebody else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:55]** Covering fire.

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:56]** Covering fire.

**[01:12:57 - 01:12:59]** And you have to meet... Fifteen.

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:00]** Fifteen?

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:05]** And we're specifying that that's covering for Rick, right?

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:07]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:09]** And I pass.

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:11]** I got 15 on the die.

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:14]** With plus 6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:16]** Plus 2 to AC?

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:17]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:19]** So you have plus 3 total.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:20]** Right.

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:25]** So hopefully the next attack from him for an AoO misses.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:30]** But, I mean, he's hitting like 30, so I doubt it.

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:33]** I don't... Yeah, I don't...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:57]** don't know of anything else i can do he is looking down at rick 19 and then the shots come towards him sound like ping right at his feet dr k and you see him look up at you and you know that you've pulled his focus and that you've given rick 19 the cover that he needs nice nicely done it is gnarly yalamis's turn hmm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:00]** I mean, she got a little toasted, no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:02]** She did get toasted.

**[01:14:02 - 01:14:06]** She's going to first move forward and try and move through those squares.

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:10]** Let's see if she can do that without falling.

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:11]** That's the first thing that she can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:14]** Did she already just initiate the closing sequence and then?

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:15]** Yeah.

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:16]** Left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:16]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:18]** Yep.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:25]** She also trips on the first five feet and falls face first and is prone.

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:27]** Love it.

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:27]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:29]** Live by the grease, die by the grease.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:29 - 01:14:35]** If you fall prone, can you still use a standard action?

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:36]** I don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:38]** I'm not sure.

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:39]** I think you can.

**[01:14:39 - 01:14:41]** You just take it at the penalties for being prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:48]** Yeah, if you're prone, you get a minus four to melee plus four to AC against ranged attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:48 - 01:14:57]** Rick19, you see her just... What does she do here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:57 - 01:15:00]** What does she do with her fingers around the corner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:05]** Yeah, I guess you can't really see too much from there, huh?

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:06]** Hmm...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:30]** through jocks what does she want to do here what does she want to do here whoa whoa whoa whoa failure means the creature can't move that round it must then succeed at a reflex while failure five or more means false prone creature that does not move or doesn't need to attempt this check isn't considered flat-footed is that from the grease so i think she's flat-footed


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:33]** Oh, she's flat-footed while she's there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:35]** Unless I'm reading this wrong.

**[01:15:35 - 01:15:36]** What are you reading?

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:36]** Sorry.

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:40]** I'm reading Archives of Nethis, Greece description.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:40]** Okay.

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:43]** So she's flat-footed, so she doesn't have any reaction.

**[01:15:43 - 01:15:44]** She has a minus or AC, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:49]** But now there's nowhere to hide since you pushed my love aside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:49 - 01:16:10]** okay she is going to do an action um okay it's melt a man's turn what was this the uh you said that you needed to give a command to attack so i think melt a man's gonna step forward and melt a man gets a bonus to his melee attacks right or to his ranged attacks against anyone who's prone


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:10 - 01:16:15]** What do you mean give a command to a... Could you restate that, please?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:15 - 01:16:17]** You gave a command to Meltaman to attack, right?

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:18]** Yeah.

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:19]** Yeah, okay.

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:20]** So he steps forward.

**[01:16:20 - 01:16:28]** I think when you're prone, you get a bonus to... Minus to range, but plus to...

**[01:16:28 - 01:16:30]** Plus four, yeah, against melee attacks.

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:31]** Okay.

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:36]** Meltaman critically fails as he steps forward and just completely misses.

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:40]** He was trying to do it, ignoring Shay's attempt to change over the coding.

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:46]** Steps forward, tries to hit Gnarla, hits the space where Gnarla was as she falls prone.

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:49]** Sylvania runs up.

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:50]** The doors are locked, right?

**[01:16:50 - 01:16:51]** Here's...

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:52]** Yes.

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:53]** Yeah.

**[01:16:53 - 01:16:59]** She runs up to the door that's next to you.

**[01:17:00 - 01:17:03]** And what does she do?

**[01:17:03 - 01:17:13]** She tries, grabs the door, shakes it, and she is going to, I think, take a shot at the window to see if she can break the window of this all-terrain vehicle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:16]** I mean, it's used by stewards.

**[01:17:16 - 01:17:18]** I imagine it might be pretty resistant to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:18 - 01:17:40]** you know it looks like a battle vehicle basically like a warthog from halo or something yeah yeah yeah i mean she's she's she's basically gonna run up and she has to beat a hardness right against the uh against the i'm just reading the material the grease i don't i don't know if you're applying it right how so

**[01:17:40 - 01:17:43]** Um, so you have to do a DC 10 acrobatics check.

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:43]** Yeah.

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:46]** That failure doesn't mean you fall prone.

**[01:17:46 - 01:17:56]** So you have to then you, so you failure means the creature can't move that round and then must succeed at a reflex save or fall prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:57 - 01:17:57]** Ah, I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:57 - 01:18:01]** Failure five or more means it falls prone immediately on the acrobatics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:02 - 01:18:05]** So I wasn't applying that extra reflex save step.

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:05]** Got it.

**[01:18:06 - 01:18:06]** Okay.

**[01:18:06 - 01:18:07]** So she isn't prone.

**[01:18:08 - 01:18:09]** Uh, let's see.

**[01:18:09 - 01:18:09]** Well,

**[01:18:10 - 01:18:15]** Yeah, she would have still been... What's the reflex save?

**[01:18:17 - 01:18:21]** It is a... Reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:24]** I don't see what it says for the reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:27]** Yeah, because it's probably just for her specifically, right?

**[01:18:27 - 01:18:29]** Like, it'll take in her own thing.

**[01:18:29 - 01:18:32]** Yeah, she fails it by five or more, so she did fall prone.

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:33]** Thank you for that correction, Will.

**[01:18:33 - 01:18:34]** Really appreciate that.

**[01:18:36 - 01:18:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:37 - 01:18:41]** Now, question is, so Rick didn't fall prone, right?

**[01:18:42 - 01:18:44]** Rick fell prone because he was unconscious.

**[01:18:44 - 01:18:46]** No, but I mean, he didn't fall in the grease.

**[01:18:46 - 01:18:46]** Colin did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:47 - 01:18:48]** Colin did, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:48 - 01:18:49]** Okay.

**[01:18:49 - 01:18:51]** Yeah, I think that was right when we did that.

**[01:18:51 - 01:18:54]** I feel like we did that right last time, and I just messed this up this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:55 - 01:19:08]** Because an added fact is a creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a five circumstance bonus to acrobatics checks to escape grapple and plus two bonus to AC against grapple combat maneuvers.

**[01:19:09 - 01:19:11]** Not that it really applies here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:11 - 01:19:11]** The greased pig effect.

**[01:19:11 - 01:19:15]** Not that they're trying to grapple, but yeah, I feel you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:15 - 01:19:15]** Okay.

**[01:19:15 - 01:19:19]** And I don't know if you're necessarily covered in grease after falling in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:19 - 01:19:20]** Yeah, I don't know about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:20 - 01:19:22]** Maybe like the front end of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:22 - 01:19:23]** Yeah.

**[01:19:23 - 01:19:25]** Well, it would probably still apply.

**[01:19:25 - 01:19:25]** All right.

**[01:19:26 - 01:19:27]** Sylvania steps up.

**[01:19:27 - 01:19:31]** She shoots at the glass with the pusher decoupler.

**[01:19:32 - 01:19:36]** And you see it start to just, like, melt away as she hits the glass.

**[01:19:37 - 01:19:41]** And I'm pretty sure I'm playing it right because it has a hardness of one and hit points of one.

**[01:19:41 - 01:19:46]** And so she hits it, deals damage to it, and the glass breaks because she's firing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:19:46 - 01:19:47]** It's the fucking worst.

**[01:19:47 - 01:20:15]** warthog from halo how is it how it doesn't have glass it's just the hardness on the police cruiser come on that's crazy i'm just saying the glass of the window yeah but what's the yeah but like the of the you're saying it's a military status like you're saying obviously beefy looking babble wheel thing it has like a normal like window come on that's crazy there's all this other body armor all the way around it that seems odd to me i think that's the token


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:20:15 - 01:20:26]** Well, sure, it's the token, but I think if we're considering purpose-built vehicles, this transport vehicle was made to move passengers across a literal hellscape.

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:34]** One shot from a fire damaging laser, I feel like, is a bit... I don't know.

**[01:20:34 - 01:20:38]** That doesn't feel right for... That math doesn't math?

**[01:20:38 - 01:20:39]** That math doesn't math.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:43]** I'll take that bet and say that I will tally up the damage to what she's doing.

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:46]** I think that she did eight points of damage to it.

**[01:20:46 - 01:20:52]** It makes sense that there's at least ten hit points of damage, which is equivalent to... Let's see...

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:56]** I'd say probably 15, which is closer to stone or concrete.

**[01:20:56 - 01:20:59]** So I'll say that the glass is 15 HP of damage.

**[01:20:59 - 01:21:01]** She's done 8 points of damage currently.

**[01:21:01 - 01:21:02]** Once she hits 15, the glass will break.

**[01:21:02 - 01:21:03]** That feels more right.

**[01:21:03 - 01:21:04]** That feels right.

**[01:21:05 - 01:21:05]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:21:05 - 01:21:06]** Because I hear you there.

**[01:21:06 - 01:21:08]** I'm not trying to just go through.

**[01:21:08 - 01:21:11]** I was just trying to look at the rules, go through, say the glass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:11 - 01:21:14]** What's the hardness on the glass on the police cruiser then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:15 - 01:21:16]** Probably the same.

**[01:21:16 - 01:21:17]** It's going to be the same.

**[01:21:17 - 01:21:21]** Because they're both like vehicles meant to...

**[01:21:21 - 01:21:44]** uh contain people in there i mean 15 is a lot like she's firing point blank at at the at the glass you know this ain't no cyber truck this ain't no cyber truck unfortunately not yeah it's like a not yet been released rick 19 is conscious but i don't think that uh that they would know that but

**[01:21:45 - 01:22:05]** Baxter is going to step up and step into the space move forward 10 feet and then is going to run another 30 or another 20 feet up next to Dr. Okay seeing that your door is open you take an attack of opportunity in your prone state I love it okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:06 - 01:22:08]** I get a minus four to melee attacks, I think.

**[01:22:08 - 01:22:08]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:22:08 - 01:22:09]** Is that right?

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:09]** Yep.

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:09]** Take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:12]** So this is only a plus three to my flip then.

**[01:22:12 - 01:22:12]** Okay.

**[01:22:12 - 01:22:13]** You flip.

**[01:22:14 - 01:22:15]** Nope, that's a miss.

**[01:22:16 - 01:22:17]** So it's nine to hit.

**[01:22:17 - 01:22:18]** You swing out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:22:19 - 01:22:21]** Here's what are you doing?

**[01:22:22 - 01:22:24]** Sylvania's at your door, literally trying to break it down.

**[01:22:24 - 01:22:25]** Dr. O.K.

**[01:22:25 - 01:22:25]** is there.

**[01:22:25 - 01:22:28]** Rick19 is conscious but on the ground.

**[01:22:28 - 01:22:31]** Colin and Bernice are in the other police cruiser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:32 - 01:22:34]** Can you roll down windows and cast spells?

**[01:22:34 - 01:22:37]** I thought we did something like that with the blue screws, right?

**[01:22:37 - 01:22:38]** The window's broken.

**[01:22:38 - 01:22:40]** I mean, I opened the door.

**[01:22:40 - 01:22:40]** It's not broken.

**[01:22:40 - 01:22:42]** It's not broken.

**[01:22:42 - 01:22:42]** Oh, okay.

**[01:22:42 - 01:22:43]** You did what through the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:22:43 - 01:22:45]** I opened the door foolishly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:22:45 - 01:22:49]** And Baxter sees an opportunity and runs for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:50 - 01:22:52]** Uh, right.

**[01:22:52 - 01:23:03]** What here's is going to do is he's going to open the side door, get out of this vehicle and then turn invisible right after that.

**[01:23:04 - 01:23:08]** So he starts to disappear, uh, as he does this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:23:08 - 01:23:08]** Okay.

**[01:23:08 - 01:23:12]** So he opens the side door, turns invisible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:23:13 - 01:23:14]** Okay.

**[01:23:14 - 01:23:15]** That's basically what he's going to do.

**[01:23:15 - 01:23:17]** Except like, say, except, uh,

**[01:23:18 - 01:23:37]** say to the group i'm on my way don't take off without me or rick i mean that that goes for saying we're without saying but he's invisible now i do this because there's no way i can get in those cars um in in one move even with a full action so yeah okay okay i had to do this okay all right

**[01:23:37 - 01:23:41]** So we're abandoning the big f***ing warthog, but I don't know.

**[01:23:41 - 01:23:41]** I don't want to take chances.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:23:42 - 01:23:44]** You get out the other side as she's banging on the glass.

**[01:23:44 - 01:23:46]** You turn invisible.

**[01:23:46 - 01:23:52]** You have a spell slot for invisibility, right?

**[01:23:52 - 01:23:52]** Of course.

**[01:23:52 - 01:23:53]** When you slept?

**[01:23:53 - 01:23:54]** Oh, yes.

**[01:23:54 - 01:23:57]** You did cast a spell right next to Baxter.

**[01:23:57 - 01:24:00]** So that is an AOL, I believe.

**[01:24:00 - 01:24:02]** Right next to him?

**[01:24:02 - 01:24:03]** I guess it is.

**[01:24:03 - 01:24:06]** Although he did have a ranged weapon, so he doesn't have a melee weapon out.

**[01:24:07 - 01:24:10]** But you did get out of the vehicle in the square next to him.

**[01:24:10 - 01:24:10]** Yeah, you're right.

**[01:24:10 - 01:24:11]** I did do that.

**[01:24:11 - 01:24:12]** But he has a ranged weapon out.

**[01:24:12 - 01:24:13]** But you weren't thinking about it.

**[01:24:13 - 01:24:16]** You're trying to get out of the truck and go.

**[01:24:16 - 01:24:17]** F*** you, Baxter.

**[01:24:17 - 01:24:18]** Oh, God.

**[01:24:18 - 01:24:19]** So you get out of the truck.

**[01:24:19 - 01:24:21]** You're like, I have to abandon this part of the plan.

**[01:24:21 - 01:24:23]** Colin and Bernice are in the front police cruiser.

**[01:24:23 - 01:24:27]** The doors have moved down another step.

**[01:24:28 - 01:24:29]** There are two more rounds before they shut.

**[01:24:30 - 01:24:34]** The front police cruiser is in the way, trying to block the door.

**[01:24:35 - 01:24:37]** Baxter is standing in front of the open door with Dr.

**[01:24:37 - 01:24:38]** O.K.,

**[01:24:38 - 01:24:40]** Rick 19 is on the ground.

**[01:24:40 - 01:24:44]** Inspector jocks herd at the top of round six.

**[01:24:44 - 01:24:46]** It is inspector jocks.

**[01:24:46 - 01:24:48]** Herds turn.

**[01:24:49 - 01:24:53]** And you see him just tighten his grip on his stun staff.

**[01:24:56 - 01:24:58]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:24:59 - 01:25:02]** Also check out, you can make the token invisible.

**[01:25:02 - 01:25:03]** I just figured that out.

**[01:25:03 - 01:25:04]** Yeah.

**[01:25:04 - 01:25:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:25:04 - 01:25:04]** It's cool.

**[01:25:05 - 01:25:05]** Yeah.

**[01:25:06 - 01:25:09]** We'll see what happens next time.

**[01:25:11 - 01:25:13]** You guys are so close to getting out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:13 - 01:25:15]** You are so close.

**[01:25:15 - 01:25:16]** This is one of the stickier things we do.
