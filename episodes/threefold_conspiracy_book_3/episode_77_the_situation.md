**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Previously, on We'll Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:14]** In a rambunctious route of resistance, our adventurers tranquilize the terrible tag team of terror Torv and Ludvaia, neutralizing them with a non-lethal knockout.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:22]** Kanika is keen to key the crew to the kernel of knowledge about the cure that kept her kind and killing spree free,

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:23]** from which Dr. O.K.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:30]** is able to skillfully synthesize a series of stunning safe-to-strike syringe sedatives for the seething savagery seen on the ship.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:38]** But just as progress is poised to punctuate their path, from the elevator airs an ear-splitting entrance blaring an ominous order.

**[00:00:38 - 00:00:40]** Kill the traitors!

**[00:00:40 - 00:00:46]** Will they apply their alchemic arsenal to incapacitate these incoming instigators?

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:52]** Or will they unravel in an unprepared uproar under the unexpected ultimatum?

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:56]** Find out this time on Will Save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:38]** You have come to the right place at the right time.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:43]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:45]** I am your half-orc GM, John Swan.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** Question.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** Question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:58]** KD, the real famous KD, Kevin Decker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** The most famous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** The most famous KD.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:04]** Who's like the f*** KD that he's like not?

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** Kevin Durant?

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** Yeah.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** That's a good question.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** Oh, the basketball player or something?

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** Yeah, there it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** Or something, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:13]** Kevin Decker is way more famous at this point.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** Absolutely.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** I don't know anything about sports.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** If that wasn't clear.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:19]** You know what?

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** People's grandmothers know me as KD.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:22]** I'm just saying.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:24]** That's cool because they know me as JD.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** JD and Katie, like the Mario Brothers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:30]** Oh, I got a girl mustache for that.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** Dude, I just saw that movie today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** How is it?

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:33]** No spoilers.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** I still haven't seen it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** It's on Peacock.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:36]** What are you waiting for?

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** Owning Peacock?

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:42]** Showing out $10 for Peacock?

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Yeah, no, I get it.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** I get it because my internet's through Comcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:52]** I would much rather own a real peacock than pay for a peacock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:52]** That'd be cool.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** Dude, they're so loud.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** I don't want to own a real peacock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:58]** Have you listened to peacock, like, the shows?

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:58]** They're pretty loud.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** What are the peacock shows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:04]** Wait, are you saying that the luffs that they send to is loud?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:09]** There's a neighborhood in Pasadena that has wild peacocks all over the neighborhood.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** They're so loud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:11]** That tracks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:42]** it's a good way to spend an hour and a half Chris Pratt does a really good job it's kind of like that nostalgia shot in the arm that our generation really loves I enjoyed it I think we're on like a fine IV drip for that absolutely we are I may have fallen asleep twice I may have fallen asleep twice that was a function of me not the movie

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:46]** I ended up, so I'm in Jacksonville, Florida, and I'm a huge Jags fan.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** And so they're doing training camp this week.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:52]** And so I took the kids to the open practice this morning.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:58]** And so like waiting in line with two kids and neither of them are football fans.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:02]** So like getting face painted and foam fingers.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:07]** We actually spent about five minutes watching practice before my daughter was like, I don't like this.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** We should go home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:18]** So that was a nice, easy morning and Saturday afternoon nap time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:24]** I forgot what the original question was, but my day was I took Grayson to Home Depot to do one of the kids' workshops.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** That sounds great.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** He built a treasure chest.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** It was actually really cool.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** I forgot about those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:30]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** Yeah, they're so fun.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** It was a great time to waste the day.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:36]** And then while I was there, I was like, oh, I'm going to buy stuff and fix my house.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** And that's the trap.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** That's the trap.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** Oh, no, for sure.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:42]** Yes.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** I'm always right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** I didn't even buy it.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:50]** I didn't even buy it when I was there because I took the measurements and it doesn't fit in my car.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** And I didn't have the capabilities of like strapping it to the car.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** And I didn't want to strap to the car.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:58]** But I bought a new screen door for my sliding door in the back.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:02]** Because the screen door I have is falling apart and I'm just going to replace it.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:06]** I had it delivered while I was out at Home Depot.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:09]** And I get home and we pull off the old door, we clean it.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:12]** It should be literally pull off the old door, put in the new door.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** That's how simple these things are, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:14]** Never.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:14]** Wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:15]** Absolutely wrong.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:18]** This thing was off by a sixteenth of an inch.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:24]** Just enough that it wouldn't fit into the... The grooves?

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:27]** Yeah, the groove, the whatever the trail is called.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:27]** The track.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** That's the word.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** It wouldn't fit into the track.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** And I was so angry.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:31]** I almost threw this thing.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** And then now I'm like, oh, man, I can't return it.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:38]** I lost my $35 for paying to have it delivered because I didn't want to put it on top of my car.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:41]** And now I have to put it on top of my car to take it to Home Depot.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** And then I'm probably going to strap the other one to my car to bring it back.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:45]** So I should have just paid the $35 in the first place.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** I should have just had it.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:46]** Ah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:53]** And now you could have paid somebody to do it for you probably by the time you're done.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:53]** Probably.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:54]** The same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:54 - 00:06:01]** Well, I think what irritates me the most is at least at Home Depot, and I need to look around, but I bought the nicer door.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:06]** I was like, oh, I'm going to get the one that has the nice spring so I never have to adjust it and all this stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** So you bought a different door and it didn't fit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:14]** No, I bought like, well, no, I bought a new door and there's just kind of like, hey, new doors, whatever.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:17]** There's a cheap one and a more expensive one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** There's only a standard size door.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** It fits on every single door frame.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:24]** It says universal, but that's a f***ing lie.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:32]** Anyways, I paid more money for the nicer door, but I realized the cheaper door is the thinner one, and I have to buy the cheaper door.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:35]** My door restricts me to the cheaper screen.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** It makes me angry.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** It makes me really angry.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:42]** I want to rip out the entire door now so I can get the nicer screen.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** I want to build the whole door around the new screen.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:47]** So what I'm hearing is you bought the wrong door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:52]** Wow.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:55]** Let's go to Lowe's, Kevin, and get another good one.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:57]** And then it said universal on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:58]** It said universal.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** It still says universal on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** It's the brand universal.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** Yeah, the brand is universal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:09]** That's why we're actually changing our name to Universal Podcast.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** It covers everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:11]** Just Universal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:12]** Yeah.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:12]** Yeah.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:13]** What was your question?

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** Universal Podcast.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** Actually, it was a question.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** You didn't even ask.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:17]** It was a statement.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** I didn't even ask it.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** But you want to know what the question was?

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:23]** What is the most boring fact about yourself?

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** So, you know, yeah.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** So that wasn't even that boring because it was a rant.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** Kelly, how good was that rant?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** All right.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** Here's the thing.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** There's like Kevin.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:34]** Hold on.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:39]** Like for context, there's some there's a high order of rants that have come before.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** So just I'm just saying that's the highest order.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** There are many.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:45]** So it just it was kind of like a.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:48]** I'm sorry, but you've had way better ones.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** It's a compliment to your usual rants, which are incredible.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** I just can't relate to your situation.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** I don't know what it is.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** It was a 3 out of 10.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:57]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:00]** Because I knew you bought the wrong door the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** Oh, you knew the payoff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:10]** Yeah, I mean, it was obvious from the start that... 16th of an inch, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** Just a 16th of an inch.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:18]** I prefer your rants about comic books, rules, nuclear power.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** Wolverine's height.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:24]** Yeah, I'm pretty upset that Hugh Jackman's coming back.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:31]** I think it'd be a good movie, but he's too tall.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** And he's not hairy enough.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** Maybe he should do what you do and just get on a box or something.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:37]** It should be Ryan Reynolds.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** Right.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** Ryan Reynolds should be Wolverine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** Yes, because he's Wolverine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:46]** I always think Robin Williams would have been an incredible Wolverine.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:46]** Robin Williams?

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:49]** Yes, I think he would have been fantastic.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** Shut up, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** I'm with Kevin on this, actually.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** I think Robin Williams would have been a damn good Wolverine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:54 - 00:09:00]** If he would have bulked up just a little bit more and full-on gone into the Wolverine play...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:01]** He was already yoked.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** Yeah, he was pretty yoked.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:05]** I'm telling you, even when he was yoked, I couldn't imagine that, though.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** He was very yoked.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:10]** Is the cartoon Wolverine accurate to the comic books?

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:10]** Yes.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:12]** Because he's nothing like that guy, right?

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** Because, like, you know, he's a gruff, like, angry f***.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** Like, that's not Robin Hood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** Have you seen Good Will Hunting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:19]** Yes.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:21]** I always forget.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:23]** One hour photo or whatever the other movie.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:27]** Robin Williams has a serious side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** He does, but I've never seen that.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** He's like Steve Carell.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** He can do some serious stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:34]** I think it would have been a good flex of his actual acting ability.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** He would have been a fantastic Wolverine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:39]** Well, Kelly, let's not... I guess I'm in the minority here.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:39]** I had no idea.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:40]** I didn't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:43]** Kelly, I don't think you're qualified to say who can be a good Wolverine.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** I think only Kev is.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:48]** Kev is the subject matter expert on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:53]** I'm going to do what Will does and just not trust the experts, really, and then make my own assessment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:54 - 00:10:00]** How is it that I don't trust experts?

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:06]** It's just... Well, when you've lived through that many timelines, you've become an expert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** Don't make something out of it that I don't mean.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** It's not a bad thing.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** I want to hear a list.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:15]** I'd have to provide a lot of context, which I don't want to have to do, but it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:20]** I want to see a list of all of Will's recursive citations.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:21]** Ha ha ha!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:25]** Where he just, like, cites his own papers from other timelines?

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:26]** Yes.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** What would the other names be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:36]** He could have been some dope people in the past.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:40]** He wrote the first APA just so he could cite himself more efficiently.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** He could have been Sun Tzu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:43]** You don't know what he was.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** You have no idea.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** He could have been Joan of Arc.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** So, Will, who in your opinion should be the Wolverine?

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** Yep, this is the new question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** We can save the other one for later.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** Who do you think should be Wolverine?

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** Um...

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** I'm with you on this, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** You know who he's talking about.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** You guys are so in sync that you just know what he's thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** Yeah, the guy from Willy Wonka.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** The Oompa Loompa dude.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:11]** No, dude.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** He's a burn man.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:12]** Ewan McGregor?

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:14]** Have you lost your minds?

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** Timothy Chalamet?

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:16]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Wes Chatham.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:25]** That's a good... In the Expanse, Amos.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:26]** That's a good get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:27]** Okay.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:28]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:28]** All right.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:30]** I'm looking up some manly actors.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** Manly, angry actors.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:37]** I don't know if he is.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** Why does he have to be Canadian?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** He doesn't have to be Canadian.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:45]** You know who it could be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:45]** Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** According to Kev, he has to be Canadian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:52]** The motherfucker who plays that guy from The Walking Dead who's like a psycho.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** That could be a million people.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** I haven't seen that show.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:55]** Jeffrey Dean.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:58]** The guy who plays like a bat and stuff.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** He played the early...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:04]** Except for he's 7'2", so no.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:04]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:07]** No one is the height that you want.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:11]** Why are you a heightist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** Go with me on this, Kev.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** Go with me on this.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:16]** Oh, I am blanking on his name.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Henry Cavill.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:18]** No.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:24]** You can't put Henry Cavill in everything.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:26]** He's too clean.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:30]** Henry Cavill has Cyclops written all over him.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:33]** He's the golden boy rule follower.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:38]** You can't make him Wolverine if he doesn't have some stank on him.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:40]** What is the stank?

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:44]** That's so like... Also, Jeffrey G. Morgan's only six feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** I'm sorry.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:45]** I'm sorry.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** I'm with Canadian friends.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** That was a mean joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:56]** So where I thought Will was going was I thought he was about to call Deep Roy, which I think would be a hilarious... Who?

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** Deep Roy.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** I'd be like Googling all these people.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:01]** I think he would be a hilarious... Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:03]** I love that.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** From RRR?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:07]** I thought you were talking about from the new movie.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:09]** Kevin, we'll do it your way.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** Peter Dinklage.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:10]** Peter Grant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** No.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** Hugh Grant is a new Oompa Loompa.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:16]** No, he's a new Oompa Loompa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** Hugh Grant?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:20]** Kevin, I think you should be Wolverine.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:21]** Done.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:28]** I would really love to see... I can picture him, and he's actually relevant to tabletop RPGs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:31]** Oh, Henry Cavill's not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:31]** Yeah.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:34]** I would love to see Joe Manganiello as... Yeah, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** But he's too tall.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** He's too tall, Kev.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:37]** And here's my thing.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** He's tall.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:42]** Tom Cruise has gotten his entire acting career acting like he was 6'2".

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:49]** So if you're going to make a movie about a short person and cast a large person, just dig some holes and make him knee height.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** That's all I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Are a lot of fighter pilots 6'2"?

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:54]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:57]** Actually, I'm pretty sure there's a height limit on fighter pilots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Yeah, there is.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** I just would like you to retract your previous statement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:04]** Tom Cruise has a height, an egotistical height.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:09]** Okay, so you're making a distinction between his physical height and the height of his ego?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** The height of himself in his mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** Have you met any fighter pilots who don't have high egos?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** You're going to base this on one movie.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** No, I've met fighter pilots.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** All of Tom Cruise's movies.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:24]** all of Tom Cruise movies, he makes sure that he is not seen as short.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:25]** Oh, no.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Even though he's only 5'7".


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:27]** What?

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** This is getting a little off the rails here.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:31]** I'm going to have to put the kibosh on this in just a second.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** Last word, Benny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:36]** And it's funny because you talk about ego on set.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:36]** He does his own stunts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:37]** Can I just say that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:40]** That's f***ing... The dude... Oh, yeah, sure.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** He works hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** Yeah, for sure.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** He's a hardworking dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** Yeah, yeah, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:50]** and this might be played out, I think Tom Hardy would do a really good overreach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** I could see that.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** But he's not short enough, so Kevin, Elijah would.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:58]** Elijah Wood would be great.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** Elijah Wood would be great.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** Elijah Wood would be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** Elijah Wood would be great.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** Elijah Wood would be great.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:08]** Elijah Wood would be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** Elijah Wood would be great.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Elijah Wood would be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:15]** Elijah Wood would be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:17]** Elijah Wood would be great.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:21]** Elijah Wood would be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:21]** Yes.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:24]** His hair is the only thing that makes him any bit tall.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:31]** Why is it when I type in Wolverine height, Elijah Wood, or no, who's the one playing Harry Potter?

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** Elijah Wood is from Daniel Radcliffe.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:36]** They're showing Daniel Radcliffe next to Wolverine picture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:41]** Because they need to be in a movie where Elijah Wood plays Daniel Radcliffe and Daniel Radcliffe plays Elijah Wood.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** Let's play it anyways.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** Yeah, let's play some Starfinder.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:50]** We are not yet currently playing the Marvel superhero game, but if we do, then we know who Kev's going to play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:53]** My next character is going to be Wolverine.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** In Starfinder?

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:54]** So a soldier.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** In Starfinder, yeah.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** I'm going to completely... Melee soldier.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** Melee soldier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:59 - 00:15:59]** Yeah.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:07]** Crossover with, like, a freaking, like... What's the... What would be, like, a ranger look in Starfinder?

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** A ranged equipment?

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:08]** What?

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:08]** Ranger.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:12]** You know, like... Or, like, druid.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** Let me just... Anyway.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:19]** Thoughts from the time I'm in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** That's what makes me...

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:23]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:26]** Dude, I love that theme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:30]** That's why that theme was on our inspiration playlist for this theme.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:33]** It was rad as hell.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** Our fearless crew.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** You four.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:40]** You have braved the terrors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** That does not describe us at all.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:49]** I think you're fearless because you're working through the terrors of this first night aboard the Void Crier.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** But y'all didn't even question it.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:57]** Kev, or rather Rick, came in all in a huff about like, something happened, something happened.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** You guys were like, all right, what's up?

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:02]** And then you just started taking bodies down.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** From realizing...

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:13]** That 24 hours of time was missing to discovering these terrifying experiments that were performed on your bodies.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:21]** To hearing the unforgettable nightmarish memories that y'all have and of the crew.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:28]** The last thing that you all needed was to, you know, face down the entire Pikes Peritons.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** Nearly entire Pikes Peritons.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:30]** Yet here we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** You destroyed them.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** We did a really great job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** You've done a good job with them.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:37]** Without killing anyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:37]** Yeah.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:38]** We did it.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** We had to hold Rick back the entire time.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:40]** I know.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** It worked really hard.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:43]** We kicked ass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:44]** You did.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:44]** You did.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:50]** Last episode, it was the fight against Ludvaia, Burly Vesk, and Tor.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** This one confused me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:56]** So Ludvaia is Flamespear, Firespitter.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:56]** Firespitter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:56]** There it is.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:57]** You got a name right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:59]** They all have two names.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** It's really confusing.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:03]** He has Sparkles, Fetch and Sparkles, or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:07]** There's only Fetch, who has a nickname of Sparkles, and Ludvaia, who has a nickname of Firespitter.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:10]** Everyone else does not have a nickname.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:13]** Do you all want nicknames?

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** I have a new middle name.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** You have to earn your nicknames.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** I've earned it.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:21]** My name is Here's the Situation Fabricius.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** Oh, get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:29]** Because we, you know, the situation because he's from New Jersey and he's going to the shore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:33]** I never thought of yours as a tool before this exact moment.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:34]** But now you see it.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** Hold on, hold on, hold on.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** Vinny, Vinny, what's up?

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** What's up, Vinny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** But I'm just like, talk about he's a tool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:44]** I just like, please unpack that for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:50]** Everyone takes one point of sanity damage from here's a suggestion because that is ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:54]** It's not for the reason you think here's is not a boy at worst.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** He's like a soft douche.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** All right.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:56]** So here's the thing.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:58]** It's like.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:08]** Because Jon sometimes will say, here's the situation, and then people will be like, yeah, here's, and reference here's in that moment as a joke.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** So I feel like it works.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** Here's the situation, Fabricius.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** Why is that bad?

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** I have one for Thaddeus, too.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:20]** It's so... It's... What is it for Thaddeus?

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** Please, pray tell.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:23]** What is Thaddeus's...

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:30]** For Thaddeus, it's Thaddeus the baddiest Bartholomew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:30]** Oh, okay.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:37]** That's good.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:37]** Come on.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** He's not a Chad, all right?

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** I mean, Chad is.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:45]** He's the baddiest, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Well, that's my ab workout for the year.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** That was amazing.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** Thanks for that.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** I mean, Kev already has Murderbot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:53]** That's true, he does.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:57]** We need one for Colin and Dr. OK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:00]** Oh, Dr. OK's is Dr. OK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** Yeah, that's his.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** It's pretty dope.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** That is, yeah.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** What about Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** Colin would like to respectfully decline.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** Colin Snooki.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** Colin.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:20]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:22]** GTL, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** GTL, baby.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:28]** Kevin's obsessed with short people, so of course it's Snooki.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:30]** Yeah.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:33]** It's pretty classic, honestly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** Oh, my God.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** All right.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:37]** I'm crying.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** Thank you for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:43]** So you take down Fire Spitter and Torf.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:49]** The cybernetic Torf with one red eye and some badass highly polished armor.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** You should ask him about it if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:55]** If we would have killed them, we could have took it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** We could still take it from them.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:58]** They're unconscious.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:01]** Yeah, definitely wouldn't be awkward to be like, where did that go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:07]** I was listening to APA and they were like, I'm going to loot all the bodies and I'm like, man, we didn't kill anyone.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** We should do that.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** We should do more of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:13]** No, it looks the same, but I promise it's not your armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:16]** Yeah, no, no, no.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** It looks very similar.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** Definitely not it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** Cover the part that says Torb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:25]** T-G for Torb Greycrack.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** Yeah.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** It actually stands for the situation.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** Capricious.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:34]** Yeah, I've had this.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** Capricious.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** The whole time.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:54]** So in the process, y'all saved Kaniko Breeze, the tactful envoy injured during the attack on Outpost Omicron, and the only other crew so far that you know who has not succumbed to this strange aggression.

**[00:21:54 - 00:22:03]** She has agreed to help you all find the remaining crew members who might be alive, deal with them, save them, whatever you need to do.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:07]** And she's grateful, honestly, that you have not killed anyone thus far.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:11]** And she is an ally for you all.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:21]** And you are on the brink of leaving when, after exploring, before I go any further, after exploring some of the

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:41]** area around it let's call it the the brig the holding the other medical bays and also might i add colin and dr okay creating from some of the medication that was in the stores and also that keniko had you created the serum that you can apply

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:48]** and inject into any of the remaining crew to deal non-lethal damage, maybe override some of this aggression.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:49]** Pretty smart.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** You're about to leave.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:58]** You're about to get exploring, looking for Orgot, Hesper, Aeol, Orvir.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:02]** And when you hear the elevator door open,

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:09]** In the elevator door, there's a... Where are those traitors?

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** You hear coming through the hall.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Sounds like Rob.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:17]** I wish.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:24]** And I am going to need you all to roll for initiative.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:24]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:31]** Give me one second before I ask you what that's going to be.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** Because here's the thing.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:35]** Looking at the map here.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:44]** Colin and Dr. Okay are inside the first room where Kaniko was.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:46]** The door is open.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:50]** Here's the situation, as I've dubbed you now in Foundry.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:50 - 00:24:13]** is in the next medical bay benny's closed eyes it's disappointing he's the true dad of the group he really is like the entire he really is we already established this and he's his daddy so it's fine so here's the situation put some sugar on my name daddy benny


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:16]** Whip us into shape.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:19]** Oh, my God.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** Tell us we're bad boys.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** Oh, I hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** I can't wait for Vinny the GM.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** That's going to be a hoot.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:28]** You know what I mean?

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:30]** That's going to be a fucking train wreck.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:31]** I'm in.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** I'm in.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:33]** One day.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:39]** So, Hears is in a separate room by himself, chilling, doing who knows what.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:42]** And Rick and Kaniko and Melt the Man.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:44]** Stealing stuff is actually what we determined.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:44]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** That's right.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:45]** Stealing stuff.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** That's right.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:51]** And Rick and Kaniko are in the hallway.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:54]** Behind Meltaman, you all were starting to walk back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:55]** Excuse me, behind who?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** Meltaman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** Meltaman!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** Meltaman!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** He's like trying to establish dominance with Rick right now.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** That's like his thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:11]** Just walking really slowly in front of you, and you keep trying to speed up, but he's just walking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:16]** What size is Meltaman?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** That's a really good question.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:21]** It's probably your favorite size, which is... That's what I'm thinking it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** What does that mean, Kelly?

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** You'll see what I mean.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:30]** Kelly's like, I'm not saying how tall he is, but he would make a great Wolverine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** He's 5'3".

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:31]** Medium.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** Oh, I thought he was short.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** Oh, okay.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** Yeah, I thought he was small.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:36]** No, dude, he's medium.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** But he's on the shorter side of medium.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:38]** He's like 5'2".

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** He's like 5'3", 5'2".

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:42]** He could be a Wolverine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:44]** Yeah, Melted Man would be perfect for Wolverine.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:51]** I just meant like he will cause soft cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** Yes, indeed, Kev.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** Thank you for pointing out the rules.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:54]** I appreciate that.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** So I'm going to shoot Melted Man first.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** Okay, sounds good.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:58]** Here's the thing.

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:03]** You all have an opportunity because the lights have turned red.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:09]** Kev gave the suggestion to me of how the lights on a submarine might turn red if you were in a mode.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** So maybe some of you can see a little bit.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** that there's a red glow outside.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:15]** But the point is that you all are hidden.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:18]** They haven't seen you, and you haven't seen them.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:25]** So I want to say that you all will have a surprise round if you want to take it.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** Yes.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** Obviously.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:32]** Now, put yourselves into the combat tracker if you want to add yourselves into that.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** Could you please... I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:36]** What is happening again?

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** You right-click on your token.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:38]** You right-click on your token.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:40]** Yeah, that I know, but like...

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:47]** Okay, because Homie just showed up, and we're going to try to do a surprise round, basically, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** There is a surprise round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:53]** Dope.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** I did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** That is available to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** I rolled an 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:02]** If for some reason you all don't want to, if all of you decide not to do anything, we will move out of initiative order.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** I'm not saying this has to be it.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** They haven't heard you yet.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** True.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** And he might not be technically a threat.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:08]** We'll see.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** That might not be a threat.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:13]** We could just, but at least, you know, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:15]** So here's the situation.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:15]** What'd you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** Yeah.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** Your situation, Fabricius, rolled an 11.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** It's already in the tracker.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** Copy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:21]** Rick, 19.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** What'd you get?

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** 19.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** You got a 19.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:25]** Okay.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** Yes.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** Super high.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** What about Dr.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** O.K.?

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** Rolled an 18.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** 18.

**[00:27:32 - 00:28:00]** wow dang y'all look at you super aware colin edenbrand 21 20 dang y'all wow geez it's like coming up i don't know we're here all right so what are you all thinking right now you start to you know you have heard them say that and then you might hear just one or two footprint so i'm gonna go um with the highest initiative first colin edenbrand what are you doing what are you thinking


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:07]** Colin is going to creep toward the danger he hears.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:12]** I would like to move into the hallway to get a better peek, but do it stealthily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** No, don't do that.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** Give me a stealth check.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** Rick is going to shout.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:22]** As soon as he hears the elevator coming down, he's going to say, everyone, get back in those rooms.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:24]** I will hold down the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** It's not your turn.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** Plus, I got a free action.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** I do what I want, John.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:31]** But can you take a free action just out of this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** So Colin steps into the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** He doesn't listen to me anyways.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:37]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:39]** Yeah, I'm definitely not.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:42]** So Colin tries to move stealthily into the hallway.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** Let's see if he can do it.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:45]** 11.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:45]** You can get.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** Okay.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:47]** I get to there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** You get to there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:51]** Is it obvious that they are trying to kill us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** Are you looking at them?

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** They said they're going to kill us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:57]** I am looking in that direction, yeah.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** The direction that he heard noises come from.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:01]** Someone muttering about traitors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:04]** You would think that it sounds pretty, I don't know, murderous.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:07]** Kev can speak to that more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:07]** Naturally.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:13]** So then... Fork.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:21]** I thought I had the... Did we split, Will, did we split the pheromone grenades or did you take all of them?

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** I took three, you took one.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:24]** Yep.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** Fair amount of grenades?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** No, they're not grenades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** They're just vials.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:30]** The shots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:32]** The shots.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:34]** No, from the Brassenea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** Oh, I have one of those.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** Yeah, I still have one left.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** Yeah, use one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:44]** Because I had two in my inventory last time.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:53]** I was trying to remember if we split them or if I just put them in my inventory and you put them in your inventory and we unintentionally doubled them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:57]** I don't know how to spell pheromone, so I don't know if I'll find it in our notes.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:57]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:01]** P-H-E-R-O-M-O-N-E.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:10]** two pheromones so I doubt you have I don't think there were four I think we only got two okay so you might have the other one so I'm done


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Dope.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:14]** I'm going to yeet one at the... Question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** In a surprise round, do you get a move?

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:18]** Do you get a full round?

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** One or the other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** One or the other.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** One or the other.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:22]** Cool.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:25]** I've moved, and that's all I'm going to do.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** It is Rick's 19th turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:30]** Right in line of the main combatant.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** What do you do?

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:31]** Rick sighs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:39]** Suddenly becoming situationally aware, Colin moves back into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:40]** I...

**[00:30:42 - 00:31:04]** yeah honestly like my plan if anything draw them down the hallway and then flank them yep exactly my entire plan leading into this battle is like to shout hey everybody get in the rooms rick was gonna go prone in the back corner and take pot shots at him until you guys can stab him in the side with a surprise attack apparently they didn't teach you tactics on akaton

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Yeah.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:11]** So Rick is actually going to just move past you and stand over the body.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:13]** So I move down the hallway.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:18]** I step past Mountain Man over Bernice and past Colin.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:22]** And I see the elevator with the three of them coming down.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** And I don't even need to roll a sense motive.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:30]** I know that they are probably all under the same influence as the other pikes that we ran into.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** So he's going to take a shot.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:31]** They are holding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** Okay.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:33]** They're holding?

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** You cut me off.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:40]** They are holding their weapons, and they seem aggressive.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** Right.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:44]** So they seem like they are looking for you, and you're taking a shot.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** All right.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** I'm taking a shot.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** Here is my question.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:51]** Does the surprise round end now that you are?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Oh, that's a surprise round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:55]** You're in a surprise round, so you can't move and attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** All right, you're right.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:01]** So Rick does that.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** Yeah.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:08]** He moves up and stands with his gun in front of Colin.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** He's basically putting himself in front of Colin.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** It's his only purpose for moving forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** And you weren't moving stealthily?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** I will try to roll stealth.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:16]** I don't think the 11 that he rolled was pretty bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:23]** I mean, this is all kind of happening at the same time, so I imagine you walk up and you bump into each other a little bit, which is part of the 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Hold on, hold on.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:28]** Stealth is... Oh, 15.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** So it's better than his.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** That's pretty good.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:31]** Question.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** You are now in line of sight of them.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:35]** Yep.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:39]** So does the surprise round end when the surprise is over?

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:40]** That's my question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:43]** No, I believe that is a part of the surprise.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** The surprise is me stepping forward.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:49]** Right, but this is all taking... So then we're just going to the next set of rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** Yeah, I think we move into round one now, right?

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:52]** That's the whole point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** Yeah.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:55]** Are you saying like everybody else loses their surprise round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** Right.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:56]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:02]** Well, I think in that time I could have equipped what I was going to equip.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** I'm not moving.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:06]** I was just going to conceal my position.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** The surprise round is all happening at the same time.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** Surprise round is three seconds.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:11]** It's happening at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:14]** I don't know why I blanked just one of those times where I was like, what does this mean?

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** Cool.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** So, Dr. OK, Rick moves up.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** You see Colin step in front of you.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:23]** And right as he steps out, Rick 19 is bumping into him.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** So it's not as stealthy as they think that they are.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** What are you thinking, Dr. OK?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:31]** Draw them down the hallway and we'll ambush them.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** Let's get them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:34]** I was trying to until Colin stepped out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** Yeah, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** I'm going to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:40]** Just expect everyone to know.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:45]** Did you actually shout in front of the enemy you're trying to surprise?

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** Get back in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:48]** It's not going to work if you do that.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:55]** In this surprise round, I am going to hide as part of a dex check.

**[00:33:55 - 00:34:02]** And so if I'm successful, then I can attempt to do a stealth check.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** I mean, do you want me to read the rule?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:13]** No, I'm going to look it up because I remember looking at... It's like a minus 10 penalty you would get to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:17]** Perception check, I think, to me if I succeed in this check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:22]** Right, but yeah, to perceiving where you are, which would affect combat, right?

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:24]** That's what I'm thinking, is that that's going to affect combat.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:31]** So if somebody could else, while you're rolling that, Will, somebody else could help me look this up to see when you're rolling Stealth to Hide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:39]** You can use stealth to hide if you have either cover or concealment or a special ability that allows you to hide in plain sight.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:49]** Or if you have successfully created a diversion with the bluff skill, you can attempt a stealth check to hide either as a move action if you are planning to stay immobile or as part of a move action.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:54]** If you move at a rate of half your speed or less, you take the penalty to your stealth check.

**[00:34:54 - 00:35:02]** If you attempt to hide while moving more than half your speed or after creating a diversion with the bluff, you take a minus 10 penalty to your stealth check.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** These penalties are cumulative in both.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:08]** Check is opposed by a perception check of creatures in the area that might detect you.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:14]** If a creature that fails the opposed skill check treats you as if you had total concealment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** Okay.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:23]** And if you attack from hiding, whoever you attack is flat-footed, which is the super key part of this, which is awesome.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** Cool.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:24]** Love it.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** Sounds good.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** So what do you do to hide?

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:27]** Tell me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:43]** I'm going to just hang back here, and for whatever reason, I'm going to kind of hide in this corner, and I'm going to put a little medical, maybe one of those IV bags with some random stuff that's like...

**[00:35:43 - 00:36:12]** kind of obscuring view so if somebody like goes to check this corner they're not going to necessarily see me right away and as they hopefully as they draw them back and I can have Bernice sort of chilling in the hallway reporting on the movement through like maybe just silent beat like silent vibrations you know to my data pad or whatever she'll work with Rick and the others to draw their draw them down the hallway and then all come from behind and attack

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** Yeah.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** Okay.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** Maybe hit him with the syringe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** Hit him with a syringe.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:17]** I love it.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** Okay.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:25]** So I can imagine Colin stepping out, Rick, and then you move over, slide something over and you like, you like slide something into your injector.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:28]** You are poised, waiting, spy-like.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:29]** Amazing.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:33]** I need to add Kaniko into here as well.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:40]** And then it is going to be, it's going to be, here's his turn.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** What do you do here's?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:43]** So, here's can't be seen from down this hallway, right?

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** I mean, like, Kevin's going to provide some cover.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** You are in the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:47]** Yeah, you are in the middle room.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** I know, but if it goes out, he's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:51]** I mean, if you step out, you're going to see whatever you're going to see.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** But you're in the room right now.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** But he can't.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** Right.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** But here's if he goes out.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:58]** Like, he...

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** Like, he's not going to be seen.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:04]** There's a bunch of people in the hallway, so I don't really think it's, like, going to ruin the surprise.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** There's a million people here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:12]** I mean, they'll see you, but it's not like they won't know that you're there, but, like, yeah, there's a bunch of people in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** Yeah, yeah, so I might as well be out here helping out.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** Okay, okay, okay.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:20]** If Hears moves out behind Meltaman, actually, I guess he'll move in front of, like, Bernice.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:23]** Wow, okay, so it's, okay, yeah.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Eye roll.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Did I miss something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:30]** This is Kevin eye-rolling this entire situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Too much metagaming.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** So here's, what do you do?

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** Not that you're actually metagaming, but what are you doing here?

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:35]** He's behind Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:37]** We're just a giant line of mobs right now.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** Yeah, so it's a straight line right at the door.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:46]** Here's behind Colin, who's behind Rick, and here's also in front of Bernice, who's in front of Meltaman, who's in front of whatever the heck your name is.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** So, like, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:53]** And now Kaniko's going to put her hands on Melt-A-Man's hips and start making a train.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:59]** For the listener, there's like one murder hole, and we've all stacked up right in the middle of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:06]** You know the tactical awareness where you're not supposed to stand in a hallway or a doorway or things like that?

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:09]** They're actually doing the complete...

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:11]** opposite of what you should be doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** Hey, here's how I know nobody reads the notes.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:22]** It's because I already entered the first line into this episode is, Rick runs to the end of the hall and slides into the prone position, warning the others to go back into the room.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** Because I assumed I'd have a high initiative.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:26]** Amazing.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:27]** Amazing.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:29]** Delete that line.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** Yeah, that's gone.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** So here's you move up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:36]** Yeah, my middle name, his middle name is now the situation.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:36]** He can't be a bitch.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** He's got to be in the hallway.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** All right.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** He's got to be in the murder hole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** Sorry, guys.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** I call myself the situation now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:48]** This situation just got a lot stickier.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** I don't know.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** That's so gross.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:55]** Unless he has... Why are you putting that out into the universe?

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Oh, okay.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** He's just sticky.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** He's right behind you.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** He's going to hug you with his chest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:01]** This is wild.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** Y'all are too much.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Y'all are too much.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:08]** Colin, just let you know I'm right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** I could smell you.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:17]** No one else around here smells like coconut all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** GTL, buddy.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:20]** GTL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:26]** I miss adding Kaniko to the... Is there anything else that you wanted to say to your comrades?

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** I don't want to say anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:30]** Kaniko's fanning herself because he hears it's so hot.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** She's like... Thank you.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** All right, so... Thanks, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:37]** As Kelly, I'm just saying... He needs no encouragement, Kevin.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:42]** He really doesn't.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** I'm trying to rep here.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** It's really good.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:45]** So...

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:57]** As Kelly, I'm just going to say, unless this mob has like something from Dark Souls, you know, there's like basically a Kamehameha wave in Elden Ring where you can just cut through like a million mobs, if I remember correctly.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** It's not going to be able to have that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:02]** Like overheat or steam whatever you got last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** All right, Kevin, you're right.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** You're right.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:05]** Here's wasn't thinking about this.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** Anyway, what here's is going to do is he's going to ready in action.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:14]** So the moment that that mother trucker fires at us, here's is going to, uh, you can't move and ready, right?

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:15]** You're going to move.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:18]** You can only move or you can say or standard.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:36]** kelly is quiet he just doesn't say anything or he's like yeah he was frozen what else can he do i mean like i just moved out into the hallway to get shot so then like i guess here's here's like hugs calling from behind that's all okay i can't do anything else i screwed up

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** You can't even do that.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:37]** You're not allowed to.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** I'm going to put my head out of the airlock.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** That's what yours is going to do.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** He feels really dumb.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** All right.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:51]** Kaniko stays where she is, and you can see that she is preparing.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:59]** She has her pistol down pointed to the ground, and she is trying to look past you to see if she can see what's going on.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:05]** And she is not going to say anything because she is trying to see what's happening, but she's going to stay right there.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:10]** as he passed the five other people standing in front.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:13]** Standing on her tippy toes, trying to look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:18]** I want to take a moment to point out that up to this point in book three, we've done really well tactically.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** Yeah.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:23]** And that pendulum has swung so far the other way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:27]** And with that, let's start this combat.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:28]** Amazing.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:32]** Now that the pendulum is the other way, you know who's turn it is?

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:34]** Second in line, Colin Edenbrand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:36]** What are you doing?

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** GTFO.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:39]** Colin sees the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** You've seen them.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** They are now looking at you.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** Wait, which situation?

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** The situation behind you or in front of you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:50]** And ducks back into the room from whence he came.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Oh my god, Colin.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** No.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:00]** Do you see Dr.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:01]** O.K.?

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:06]** Because if not, then you're flat-footed against his attack.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** So it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:10]** So now here's his expose because it's just a passed out person in front of him.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:10]** Dr.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:15]** 's going to just whisper to Colin and be like, just pretend you're in the bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:20]** Gets in the bed and pulls the covers over him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:23]** Oh yeah, that's a great idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** Alright.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** All right, so what are you doing, Colin?

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Thanks for the support.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:28]** You step back into the room.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:28]** He steps back into the room.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:34]** He, like, climbs into the bed, but he lays prone in the bed with his needler pistol aimed in the doorway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** Oh, my God.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:35]** What is happening?

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:37]** Why is everyone so out of character?

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:43]** I'm doing the opposite of what I do, and everyone else is doing the opposite of what they usually do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:43]** It's so ridiculous.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:53]** First, just for prone, prone gives you a minus four or plus four AC to range attacks, but a minus four AC...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:53 - 00:43:19]** to melee so if you're a prone inside of a door and somebody steps through the doorway you're giving them the advantage i'm rick was going to go to the end of the hallway so he has at least 40 feet so i don't i don't want to mitigate too much but like the beds are against the southern wall so like i can't see the hall right door the room so i don't know i'm prone in a bed 10 feet from the door and are you prone laying on your stomach looking at the door

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** Trained with my Needler pistol, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:24]** He's got like a CPR dummy that's in the bed.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:30]** And then his legs are actually up by the CPR dummy.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:37]** And he's got his rifle coming out the bottom, just like sort of peeking from under the sheet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:41]** It's a very well-endowed CPR dummy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:46]** We are 45 minutes into this episode and just started combat, which is the only thing we had to start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** No, we are through the surprise round.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** We made it through the surprise round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** But we're starting the first round.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:51]** This is wild.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:56]** So Colin is prone in the bed, moving back in.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:59]** I'm going to add that condition to you that you are prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:09]** So he's also going to load one of these, the serum doohickeys into his needler pistol.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** Okay.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:16]** so that when he takes the shot, it's going to be to remedy the situation.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:19]** It's not going to be to just ruin somebody's day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Stop saying situation, please.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:25]** No, I don't think I will.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:25]** Amazing.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:31]** So Colin moves back in, walking out, bumping into Rick, making a lot of noise.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** And he's like, well, damn.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** Sorry.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Oh, my bad.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:39]** Walks back in, gets in the bed, trains a shot, adds a serum to the needler pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** He's a healer.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** We'll give it to him.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:44]** I feel like that's his main contribution.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** So we don't want to.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** He should be alive to heal us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:50]** Generally speaking, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** That's it.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** That's his turn.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** Solid turn.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:58]** Rick19, you see the three of them about to step out of the elevator.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** They have seen you.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** They have heard what's happening.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:03]** They are all focused in your direction.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:04]** Right.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:10]** Rick is going to take a shot at Orgat non-lethally.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:12]** Okay.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:14]** That's a natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:15]** Wow.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:16]** Solid.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Amazing start to this.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:21]** This is a great combat.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** Yeah.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** What a great situation.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:26]** Oh, boy, look.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** Let's figure out what we're doing here.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:34]** Reef 19, tell me when to stop on your... I feel like I'm installing that damn screen door again.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** Stop there.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** Okay, stop.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** I stopped.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** This should have been so easy.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** 16th of an inch off.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** It's the name of the card.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** You fired.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:50]** It's 1 16th of an inch off, and it bounces and ricochets back into your face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:55]** Orgot is too short to play Wolverine, so it goes over her head.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:58]** What kind of attack was this?

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Kinetic?

**[00:45:59 - 00:45:59]** Energy?

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:00]** Energy, yeah.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:01]** Energy.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** Okay.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:03]** Ooh.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** You got careless.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:08]** You can't take a guarded step for 10 minutes.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** Oh, that's fine.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:13]** So this whole round, you can't take a guarded step.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** So you should write that down.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Don't forget.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** 10 minutes, you said?

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** 10 minutes, dude.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:20]** That's like a lot of rounds.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:22]** What happened that caused you to not?

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:25]** Or do you want me to tell you what I'm thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:27]** I think he's just so frustrated.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:32]** He had everything kind of envisioned on how this was going to happen.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:32]** Yeah.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:42]** These three were going to come funneling down the hallway one by one, and then each of you were going to just prick them with the serum, and they were going to just come out of it, duck into the room, and take the next one out.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:46]** And then you guys all just jumped into the hallway right in front of him.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** Write it down.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** And he's just furious about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:54]** It took Kevin eight episodes to forget about the experience of being a GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:54 - 00:47:01]** So I think, yeah, Rick is just flustered by everything that just happened.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:06]** And he's, like, looking back over his shoulder as he was aiming because he's, like, trying to wave it.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:08]** He's literally waving his arm back.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:08]** Like, get back.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:09]** Go back in the rooms.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** And he misses.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:15]** And he's just so focused on that that it shoots himself in the foot.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:41]** not yeah wow i i do like this idea that like you hear a situation rick 19 has one idea dr k has another idea all of you have different ideas and rick 19 just picks the one that is the direct access and then hits everybody else like this this miscommunication and and ships in the night is just interesting it's cool narratively and with that uh i don't take a guarded step


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:42]** Okay.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:45]** But I do step back five feet.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Okay.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:50]** Because I'm not going to just step behind here's, but I step back to here's.

**[00:47:50 - 00:48:00]** I'm literally, like, walking backwards, gun pointed down the hallway, and my left hand, Rick is pushing, and he feels here's, and he nudges him, and he says, get in one of the rooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:04]** And that's his turn.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:04]** Okay.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:04]** Okay.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** Okay.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** That's a good turn.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** Question.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:14]** In order to do harrying fire, do you need to be able to see your target?

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** I believe so.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** You have to do an attack roll.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:18]** Well, yeah, but the attack roll is against AC-15.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:22]** I don't know if you need to have eyes on your target, right?

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** I don't know, man.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** You act like a nose book back there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:30]** I think in order to roll an attack, you have to be able to see your target or pick a square to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:37]** So I think because it is now after Rick 19 is certain it is now Kaniko's turn.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:42]** And so Kaniko is going to ready in action.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:47]** And she says, I know how they're going to fire.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** I think I know them well.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** I will do my best.

**[00:48:51 - 00:49:16]** to call out what will happen to help you out so she is going to ready an action as soon as she can see whoever is is coming up in line of sight then she is going to use and one of her abilities to help you all out so that will move her in the initiative order and the ready action means that it will happen after if it's an offensive action before if it's a defensive right so we're good cool

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:21]** Okay, so that would be Hears and the Situation.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:23]** You've never seen them in the same room.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:26]** The Situation and Rick19, and melt them in here.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:28]** And probably Dr. O'K, you can hear that as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** Dr. O'K, it's your turn.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** What are you doing?

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:37]** So Dr. O'K is going to equip his tactical syringe spear and lie in wait.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:45]** And then he is going to command Bernice to take a shot.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:50]** I believe whoever this one is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:51]** Which one?

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** The person in front?

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:54]** Orgott.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Orgott.

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:08]** So I think behind Rick and Hears and the fact that you're still 20 feet away from a door, I don't... I would say that they have total cover from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:11]** In which case, maybe Herring?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** That's what we're talking about now.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** Would you have cover...

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:16]** And does that count?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:33]** I think... So the cover won't affect the fact that it's AC-15, but the fact that you can barely see them, maybe Bernice would still take a shot in that general direction, trying to make her... Yeah, because, I mean, Bernice is going to want to take a shot to try and lure them down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:38]** So I actually think it would be covering fire, maybe.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:39]** Okay.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:39]** Okay.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** So it's gonna be covering fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:44]** Make sure you're not using the one needle that has the stuff in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:48]** No, it's just with her vapor cavitation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:48]** Oh, okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:53]** And I'm just looking at the rules for covering fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:53 - 00:51:01]** Yeah, so it's AC 15, and then somebody that you choose would get a plus two to their AC against the next attack from the creature in your line of effect.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:06]** Which I would say that you're in a line of effect, they just have total cover from you.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:10]** Or maybe not total cover, because total cover means you can't make an attack at all, right?

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:13]** So instead it would be... What is it, improved cover?

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:13]** What would that be?

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:17]** It would be improved cover, which is a plus eight to their AC.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:21]** So you could try, but it says total cover.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:23]** You can't make an attack against an enemy.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:29]** I think you could make an attack, but they would have approved cover or just a covering fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:29]** I might hold off then.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:33]** I'm just going to deliberately make a noise.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Ooh, what do you do?

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:34]** What do you do?

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** Just going to like...

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:46]** Hit Melt Man's foot with, like, just going to roll up to Melt Man and see if Melt Man makes any, like, interjections or whatever.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** Bernice is going to just, like, bump into him real quick.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:51]** How dare you, citizen?

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** I will destroy you.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:58]** I'm guessing this would be a bluff check for, like, to see how well it goes to make a diversion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:00]** Okay.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:01]** Yeah.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** Yeah.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:08]** I mean, if you're trying to get them to pull attention down there further down the hall, that's not even a bluff check.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** That's what you're trying to do.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:12]** You're trying to get them to come down the hall, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:17]** Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to make them, I'm creating a diversion to attempt to beguile.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** Attempt to beguile?

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Look, I'm reading diversion text.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** Is that in the core rule?

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:22]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** As a move action, you can use bluff to create a diversion.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** Your bluff check is opposed by sense motive check.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:30]** Of the creature you are attempting to beguile.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:40]** If you succeed, you can either attempt to hide the task of stealth as if you had cover or concealment or gain 10 plus bonus.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** I don't know if this applies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** That's fine.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** You can do that.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:46]** I guess I'm just asking, what are you trying to get out of it?

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:48]** Are you trying to get cover for Bernice?

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** Are you trying to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:49 - 00:53:08]** What Bernice is trying to do is draw their attention to herself at the other end of the hallway so that we would get an increased perception stealth bonus down here in the room that we're in south of Bernice.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:11]** It's like throwing a pebble the other direction, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** Yeah.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** I don't think you need to roll for that.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:17]** I think you are literally doing that.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** That's all we're doing.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:20]** That's cool.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** Yeah, that makes sense.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:29]** So right now, they know that Rick19 is there and has stepped back, and they know that somebody is down the hall, and they have no idea about Dr. O'Kara Collin.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:30]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** Yeah.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** I like it.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** Okay, that makes sense.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:37]** They should have heard maybe Meltzman say something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:37]** Oh, yeah, of course.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:42]** Yeah, but they know there's something going on at the end of the hallway, and they know there's Rick19.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** And that's it.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:51]** Okay, it is Bernice's turn, and then it is the crazed periton's turn.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:58]** Rick, you hear the voice that you recall possibly as Hesper.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:01]** You hear, go f*** them up, Al.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:07]** And then you don't see it, but Hesper is going to do something.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:12]** There's a bright light that maybe you can't see from where you are around the corner.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:20]** Then, Eil takes a few steps forward and moves into your line of sight, Rick.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:28]** This human with this massive gun that is a...

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:32]** you would know to be a squad machine gun.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:36]** And they just level it down the hallway.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** Big mistake.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:40]** And they are going to fire.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** They're going to take a full action.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:50]** And from the way that the gun looks, you can tell that Hesper cast supercharged weapon.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** Oh, no.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** Not good.

**[00:54:54 - 00:55:01]** I am going to make my rolls against Rick19 and here's Fabricius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:02]** It would hit.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** Here's two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** Yeah.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:08]** Well, I guess I could target them both at Rick 19.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** No, you don't have to.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** That's not what I'm saying.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** I just I didn't know that.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** That's true.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:12]** That's a good point.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:16]** Thank you for that idea, Kelly.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:19]** Oh, I guess I can't move into a full action.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:23]** But question is, can I do automatic even though it has the automatic?

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:25]** I think automatic is a full action.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:29]** That is a really good question that I'm going to look up really quickly.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:33]** automatic weapon, Starfinder.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:38]** Yeah, it's when you make a full attack in addition to attacking normally.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** Okay, cool.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:50]** Yeah, so it's just going to be one attack against you, Brick19, because Aeol had to move to get into your line of sight, standing five feet away from the door, looking down this hallway with five individuals at it.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:54]** So keep in mind that after this, Kaniko's going to get a turn.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** But before we do that...

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:56]** I'm going to roll.

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:02]** This is going to be, and Kelly, supercharged weapon only adds to your damage, correct?

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** That's six.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:05]** Okay.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:05]** All right.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** So if we hit.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** That's quite a lot, though.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** That is quite a lot.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** If they hit.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** Maybe they want it.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Let's see.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:15]** Levels the weapon.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:21]** And as they're looking at you, Rick19, there is a definite, like, slow smile.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:24]** And I don't know if you remember Eyal.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** I don't know if you talked to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:34]** But Eyal has this, like, I don't know, but I'm going to try and kill you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:38]** That's a 22, Rick19, against your KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:44]** See, if I was back in the back and prone, that wouldn't hit me.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:47]** But... But... That hits.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:50]** Because I had to walk to the front to protect everyone else.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:53]** Because I'm selfless and stupid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Because you're a good murder bot.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:56]** Yeah, I mean, he's like our tank.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:57]** Alrighty.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** I'm going to roll some damage here.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** I just rolled one die.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** I still have to roll the other die.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** What's the supercharged weapon dice?

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:05]** It's 4d6.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** I have just rolled.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:11]** I say this very sadly.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:19]** I just rolled the D8, and I'm going to roll the 46 first.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** That's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** Oh!

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** Oh, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:25]** Faster.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** Okay.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:31]** You can take a lot of damage here, bro.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:33]** I am sorry that it came to this.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** Yeah, we're sorry too, man.
