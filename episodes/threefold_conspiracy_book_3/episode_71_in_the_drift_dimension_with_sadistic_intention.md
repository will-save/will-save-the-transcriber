**[00:00:01 - 00:00:04]** previously on We'll Save.

**[00:00:05 - 00:00:13]** Our would-be warriors were welcomed by the slightly stute stewards as the doctor wandered the void crier wishing for a water closet.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:28]** And bedrest beckoned Eden Brand and the bunch as Bernice kept watch, but the murder bot's thirst for blood sport wasn't abated by the boisterous band blaring on the squat box, but instead by the bitterness of a beverage turned bad.

**[00:00:29 - 00:00:34]** Will Rick's lukewarm libation be the only objectionable object to enter his body?

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:39]** Or are our adventurous orifices about to be odiously assaulted?

**[00:00:39 - 00:00:43]** Find out this time on Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:26]** You have come to the right place.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:31]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** We'll save!

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** We'll save!

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:34]** We'll save!

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:34]** We'll save.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:36]** I am your unassuming GM, John Swan.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** And I am here with my fantabulous cast.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** Let's go around.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:42]** We got Vinny Rodriguez.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:45]** Vinny, give me a... Hey, there it is.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** We got Will of Garrett.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** What's up, Will?

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** How we doing?


## Speaker_0

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** Hi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:52]** Hi, we got Kevin Decker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** What's up, ladies and gentlemen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** Hello, hello.

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:03]** And last and possibly the tallest, it's always a toss-up between Will and this giant Kelly Gilliam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** How we doing, Kelly?

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:07]** I am definitely not competing for tallest.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** I feel like you were.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:11]** Every time we talk, you're always like, I'm telling you, we should have done a high line.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Vinny is the tallest.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** My name is Kelly Gilliam.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** You can see from this mug that John gave me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:22]** Actually, I think Kev's the tallest when he's standing on the soapbox.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:24]** He's definitely the tallest.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:24]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** Yeah.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:30]** Since Kev never gets off of his soapbox, he's officially the tallest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:30]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:33]** And then his soapbox increases when he's on a ramp.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** It grows.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:37]** It grows several inches.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Dynamic soapboxing.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** I really like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** I'll always go to the town square when Kevin has a ramp to make.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** I will for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:49]** Kev's soapbox is actually directly related to the intensity of his rant.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:54]** And as it ebbs and flows, it just like... Does it glow?

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:56]** Because it's powered by nuclear energy.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:56]** Wow.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** Yeah, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** It's actually just LEDs.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** I upgraded it last year.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** Oh, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:04]** Sorry, you upgraded it from nuclear to LEDs.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** That's what he did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:06]** Yeah.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:08]** For the environment.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** It's wind powered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** It's wind powered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:16]** You really have to be worried.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:19]** That was a 4D chess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:24]** That took me a minute on that slow burn.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** All right.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:26]** I got a question.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** Nope.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** Let's start off our ba-ba-ba-banter.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** Question is... Ba-ba-ba-banter.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** Take a second.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:33]** Go back.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** Think in your brains, in your old noggins.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:45]** What monster or creature were you maybe scared of when you were little?

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** And maybe you still are.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Oh.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** We've talked about this, at least.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** Have we?

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** For me, at least.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** Okay, well, you're always on your thing.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** What the f***?

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:56]** The worms?

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** The most unrealistic mob ever?

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** Shia Lute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:07]** I mean, I lived in Southern California where earthquakes are common, and yes, tremors were frightening.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:09]** Yeah.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** I didn't mean to s*** in your fear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:12]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:17]** If those things existed, I would also be really afraid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** You're afraid of Trevors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** What a f***ing b****.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** Yeah, I'm so scared.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:24]** Who's afraid of Trevors?

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** You're afraid of losers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:26]** Did you say clowns?

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:30]** I'm actually more of a b**** because, like, no, it's not clowns.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** I don't get the clown fear.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:35]** But, like, I'm actually afraid of grey, specifically grey aliens.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:38]** That was the thing that I actually had the most fear of as a kid.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** Yeah, which is great for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:42]** So you're really terrified of John as a GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** Yo, we are...

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:49]** We are two books balls deep in this thing.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:51]** We've met three Grays so far.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** I used to have so many nightmares of them.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:56]** This repeated nightmare of them coming into my room and lifting me up.

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:00]** That was the nightmare I had probably, I don't know, 300 times as a kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** Wait, can you say that again slower?

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** They came into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:10]** Yeah, they came into the room, and they gave me slushies and fast food, and then we all would come out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** It was terrifying.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:12]** Dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:14]** Did they like ghost lift you?

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:16]** Like the dance?

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:25]** I don't know what a ghost lift is, but... It's like where you run and you leap and you catch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** Oh, yeah?

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** Like a rock and roll concert?


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** Actually, I don't know.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** It blacks out about there.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:33]** Like I'm crowd surfing over gray aliens.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** That'd be awesome.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:35]** Okay.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** So they lifted you up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** Got it.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:38]** Cool.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:41]** So this has been like 170 episodes of your deepest fears.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** Yeah.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:44]** And none of us knew this.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:44]** The gray bounder for me.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:46]** And we just now found out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** No, for real.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:50]** The gray bounder was the scariest thing we've encountered so far.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:54]** I've since corrected this fear.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** Kelly, you're such a trooper.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** How did you correct this fear?

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** Actually, I don't know.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** I slowly exposed myself to alien movies.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:10]** Exposure therapy for 170 episodes.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:14]** Now I'm afraid of what Kevin's afraid of.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:15]** The treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:18]** That fight in Unknown Treasures that sold it for him.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** That's it.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** I'm not afraid anymore.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** That's so funny.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** Well, thank you for sharing that.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** Drift Phantoms, they're my new fear.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:26]** Drift Phantoms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** Love it.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** Who wants to go next?

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:37]** I've talked about my recurring nightmares as a kid with the Monstars from Space Jam.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:45]** I won't go back to that well, but the one horror movie that stuck with me the most wasn't a horror movie at all.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:49]** I'm sure all of you have seen Goosebumps.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:52]** I think it was the first episode, Night of the Living Dummy.

**[00:06:52 - 00:07:21]** like I was convinced I would not take a bath as a kid with the door closed like I was convinced that f***ing dummy was right behind the toilet ready to jump out and eat me that was the one that was like on the book covers too every time I went to the store I was staring at it that was the creepiest dummy I've ever seen in my life I still don't love ventriloquists there was that one we had one at our wedding I'll cancel it

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:22]** Really?

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** No.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:27]** This is such a random addition to your wedding.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:33]** No, I'm not going to cancel it.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:33]** Yeah, it was that.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:40]** And then when John and I were in our early 20s, we went to a mutual friend's house to watch.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:42]** What was it?

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** Dead Silent.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:43]** Dead Silent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:54]** Which was a horror movie about a ventriloquist witch who would just rip your tongue out and kill you and make you a... It was the worst.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** That does sound kind of creepy.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** For lots of reasons.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** That night was pretty bad for lots of reasons.

**[00:07:59 - 00:07:59]** Yeah.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:01]** But that was... I do recall that.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** I do recall that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:04]** To be fair, dolls are creepy to be in with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** Dolls are always creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** Yeah, they are.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:10]** So yeah, that's, that's, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:16]** Also the, are you afraid of the dark with the pool, with the creature that came up from the, from like the deep end?

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** Do you remember that?

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** Just Google it.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** It's still kind of terrifying.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:22]** I don't think I will pull you down and drown you.


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:23]** I'm good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** That one and sounding are going to remain blue.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** I'm not Googling anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:29]** That's a blue link forever, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:57]** do you want to share your fears from this century could be from another millennia wherever you've had he's like dysentery wild boars tuberculosis no because I'm always packing I don't care about wild boars no

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:05]** I actually wanted to mention that I resonate very much with Kev's fear of tremors when that came out, being in Southern California.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:08]** That was a minute.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:27]** But I think for me, the demons that plague all reality, so the Exorcist movies and The Omen was a really good horror movie for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:46]** super scary super intense um yeah those types of uh forms of like pure evil is what i'm afraid of i guess pure evil that's a very well answer i like yeah it's very like have you seen legion no with a star studded cast

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** I don't know.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:56]** And it's that supposedly back in the past, there was something that was...

**[00:10:56 - 00:11:26]** enough like us but not really that was like an enemy of ours as a species and it would like use like sort of it would like transform itself or make itself look like a human to like kind of like trick us yeah this is I don't know how well subscribed to this theory is but what do you think of that Will did you experience that in your travels in my travels yeah yeah is this what you mean is that a demon or something with evil trying to mimic humanity's unblemished I don't know

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:12]** Yeah, it's down in Tampa.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:14]** Two of the beers that came in this variety pack are called Florida Man.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:16]** It's Florida Man and Florida Man on the Moon.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:16]** They're both IPAs.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Amazing.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:18]** There it is.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** All right, go ahead, John.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:20]** What were you going to say?

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** I forget.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:21]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:25]** I was going to say... Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:26]** Yes.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:27]** Let's play.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:30]** Wait, we didn't get to hear about your fear, though, John.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:31]** Rewind.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** What's your fear?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** I'll say it, and then let's get playing.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** I think I've mentioned it before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:40]** John's fear is technical difficulties before we play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:44]** Yeah, technical difficulties are my literal nightmare.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:47]** No, it is the undead.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:50]** I have an irrational fear of the undead.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:56]** And now, like Kelly, I'm more like I can watch The Walking Dead, Last of Us, like just that kind of zombification.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:57]** Totally fine.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** Have a good time.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:58]** Great shows.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:07]** But there's still a small part of me that irrationally is like just the idea of reanimation and sitting up in a morgue with a sheet.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** It's just like it creeps me out.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** Yeah, I get that.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** I'll never lose it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:18]** I'll say that the bath salts guy in Florida that one time, I was like, oh man, the apocalypse is here.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** That video, man.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** But anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** That got me buying some more ammunition.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** Those people are out here too.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:28]** Like there's another form of, yeah, it's like weird.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:28]** All right.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:35]** Let's do a little recap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** The lights...

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:44]** Of the drifts glow brilliantly outside the windows of the void crier.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:48]** Thank you for that visual help, Benny, of your hands conveying light.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:50]** I think that brought everybody into the mood.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** I think that's what we needed at that time.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:52]** Thank you.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** You're welcome.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:53]** Do it again.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** Glows outside.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:09]** Outside the windows of the Voidcrier, strong start, the stewardship bound for the base on Varos, a moon of Brithida.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:20]** Now, our survivors have found some respite with a quaint tour of their temporary home aboard the starship last episode.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:39]** You met various members of the Pites Peritons, like Orgott, the Phrasma-loving half-orc reading in the lounge, or Torv, the badass elf, or sorry, not elf, dwarf, and Sarzael, the badass elf.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:44]** And as the day goes on, most of you are tired.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:49]** You, you know, here's Dr. OK, Colin, you retire to sleep.

**[00:14:49 - 00:15:03]** You're wiped out from the last six hours, which truthfully, hours ago, you were fighting for your life on Outpost Omicron, trying to suppress this beastly quantum troll and prevent your imminent destruction.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:05]** So, yeah, you need a nap.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** Makes sense.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** Except one of you was like, you know what?

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** That Brutaris match.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:13]** Kind of into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** So I'm going to stay up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:16]** Who was that?

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:18]** Going to watch the info cast.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:18]** Oh, who was that?

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:19]** I don't know.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** Stupidest thing I ever did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:43]** so rick rick 19 decided he's comfortable enough with the people the stewards and the void crier that he took off his armor and left his weapons in his in his room and went out to join the crew to watch super taros match oh my god good times


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** Chef's kiss.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** You learn nothing.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:54]** You're watching the match between the Buzzblades and the Red Sonics, right?

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:56]** You're enjoying the company of these new people.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:59]** You're learning a new sport.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:04]** Anything to kind of take you, take your mind off of the past few days.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:05]** Have a good time.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:09]** You're eating some nice kind of home cooking food.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** You're drinking.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** Does Rick drink alcohol?

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:11]** No.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** Yeah.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Okay.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** So you're drinking.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:20]** You know, Gnarla mentioned that you're going to bring out the good stuff.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:23]** So you try some nice bottles of something.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** You're having a good time.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** You're swapping stories.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** You're talking with people.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:31]** I think you were sitting between Orvier and Torv, I think.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:39]** So maybe Orvier's leaning over to you, pointing at the screen when there's a goal or there's a certain play and the crowd goes wild and everyone goes wild.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:41]** It's a good time.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:51]** And then suddenly, there's an aww as the TVs go off.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** Gnarla.

**[00:16:55 - 00:17:00]** shouts out loud as this loud music begins blasting in the galley.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:13]** And you Rick and 18 remember, and maybe you smile a little bit at, at Shay's joke of playing the new, uh, the new tune from strawberry machine cake.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:17]** My code will go on as soon as it drops.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:20]** You take a sip of your drink.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** You notice your drink.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:25]** is warm.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** And that's where we pick up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:37]** You also said that the food around me looks stale or old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:41]** Not stale, just not moldy, just sitting out.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** It felt warm.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:44]** Like hours old?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** Did you give me a time frame?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** There was no time frame.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:52]** Not moldy like it had been there for weeks or days or something.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** Years, decades?

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** Just seemed like it had been left out.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:57]** You know, like somebody just leaves it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:00]** Can I... Spend like seven hours or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:04]** Yeah, can I do, I guess perception check is the first thing I can think of, but can I do a check?

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** Okay, I'll do perception.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** Hit.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:08]** Start my timer again.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:12]** Six on the die, so it's probably going to be a nothing.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:16]** I'll hold on, my hero lab is slowly loading.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** And we wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:21]** The Hero Lab crawl begins.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:25]** 30 minutes later.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:25]** Sorry, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** What's that?

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:30]** I'm only seeing a weird splash screen on Hero Lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Yep, that's fine.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** That's fine for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:34]** On Foundry, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** I just wasn't sure.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:35]** On Foundry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** If you're back on the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:37]** Yeah, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:42]** I'm going to assume it's only a 6 or something like that, so it's a total of 12.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** Call 12 for now.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** What are you trying to perceive?

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:52]** Well, first, so you say that and notice the food and the drink.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:58]** I think the next thing he would look at is the faces around him, like the people.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:01]** Is there something weird going on with anyone in the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:07]** So you were sitting in between Sarza El, the elf, Shay.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** Ezra was behind you.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** Torv was right behind you.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:14]** And Orvir is right back to your right.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:17]** Gnarla is on the other side of Sarza El.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:21]** And then actually Firespitter is leaning against the wall.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:23]** So they gave you the best seat in the house.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:28]** And you look around and people seem... Some people maybe look at their data pads.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** Some people...

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:31]** Seem just a little kind of confused.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** It's late.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:32]** People are tired.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** Somebody yawns.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:43]** Narla actually, as soon as that music hits, looks up and around and pulls out her data pad, quickly taps.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:48]** The music stops and says, who the f*** did that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:52]** Okay, last thing before I make an actual action.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:56]** Can I do a physical science check?

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:57]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:04]** As you're doing that, you hear Shay say, Yep, that was me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:06]** I just wanted to play a little joke on you, Narla.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** Love ya.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:10]** This is just some friendly times.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:14]** But hey, more importantly, who turned off the TV?

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** And looks around.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** Okay.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** All right.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** Probably just a power thing.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:23]** Gets up.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:26]** Shay starts to walk over to turn on the TVs.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:30]** What was the physical science check for?

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:35]** To see if I can understand anything that just happened.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:39]** The weird time warp thing is really screwing with his head.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:46]** The fact that the drinks and the food are instantly aged an unsaid amount of time.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:50]** And yeah, I want to say like the TV thing, but I don't think he would be thinking that.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:56]** I feel like he would assume that that's peripheral to what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:02]** That's the only conclusion that you can land on.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** The TVs come back on.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** Wait, you didn't give me anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:11]** That was just my own conclusion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** I said what I said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** The game is off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:20]** And you know how when a recording stops, it might just end?

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:24]** There was no attempt to put a control menu play pause on this.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** It's just the stream.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** It ends.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:29]** It's frozen on the final score.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:32]** And as you're thinking this, you hear another grunt.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:38]** And one person, obviously Torv, is like, yeah, that's what I wanted to see happen.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:40]** Because the Red Sonics have won.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** The final score is displayed on the screen.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:45]** You missed the last part of the match.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** Very odd.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:53]** With your perception check, you would notice, you hear as Gnarla walks out.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** You see Gnarla furiously looking at her datapad.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** And she walks out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:06]** Yeah, I think Rick would, you know, there's probably a lot of commotion going on, like the game's over, people doing their thing.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:12]** And I think Rick would use that as a way to slip out and follow her because he would also want to go.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:17]** I think he's just going to, she's leaving out the door that leads to where our rooms are anyways, right?

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:25]** So I think Rick's intention would have been like get up and move to at least tell the others, hey, something's not right.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** Yeah.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** But the fact that she's leaving too.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** Sorry, what's her name again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** Gnarly Yalamus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** Gnarly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** With a G?

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** Gnarly.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** No, N-A-R-L-A.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Gnarla.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:41]** As you start to walk out, I'm assuming that you're starting to walk out, right?

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:42]** Yes.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:50]** You hear from behind you, Torv, are you okay?

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:54]** And maybe you turn around and Torv...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** I don't like this.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:59]** I don't like this at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** Yeah.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** That's weird.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:02]** Their head is down.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:05]** The dwarf's head, you know, sitting on the stool.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:07]** They don't rise too much farther than the table.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:22]** But then they look up and you see that Tor's eye, which is typically orange, has actually become green.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:29]** And I put Torv up on to Foundry so you can see Torv's character art.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** Or art there.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** Not their character art, but art that I have.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:35]** Their eye has turned green.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:39]** That orange technological layer eye or whatever?

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** Yeah, their left eye has turned green.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:47]** So Torv is, I think we talked about this, but he is a short dwarf.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:47]** He's a cyborg.

**[00:23:47 - 00:24:08]** cyborg dwarf yeah he's wearing some kind of mechanical armor has an arm mechanical arm coming up over shoulder and his eye has almost three different lenses that are all three orange but you're saying that there's a turn to green yeah does that mean he's like ready for battle or something yeah it's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** It is fine.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** I will be fine.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** Do not stop, Ezra.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** Stop touching me.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:17]** And gets up and starts to follow you out, Rick.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:20]** I'll see y'all in the morning.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:21]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** Can I roll a sense motive on that?

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:26]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:28]** Oh, it's a plus zero.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:33]** And I think I have some kind of negative effect because I'm an android.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:33]** Is that right?

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** Constructed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:38]** You do have a penalty because you are an android.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:44]** I don't know if it's for sense motor, but it is for... 14 on the die, so it's a 14 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:48]** I don't want to be the only one in this right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** Seems like they're just bothered.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** That's weird.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** They have no idea why.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:55]** They just want to leave.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:59]** There's nothing nefarious or good or anything.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** It's odd.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** Clearly they're feeling something.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** So you're walking down the hall.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** You leave everybody behind.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:10]** As you leave, I'm just off screen.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:14]** Orvier realizes that you left.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:18]** And everybody starts to just kind of talk and clean up.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:23]** And you hear plates starting to be put into the sink as you start to walk down the hallway.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:29]** Right as you leave the door, you saw Gnarla get into the elevator on your lower deck.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:39]** I don't think Rick would do anything specifically except observe.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:41]** So unless there's something standing out.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:44]** Where is Torv at this point?

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:44]** Right behind me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:52]** Yeah, I just started to move Torv down the hall because I assumed that you were still in the hall, but Torv is just going to start walking past you.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:55]** Their room is over on the right.

**[00:25:55 - 00:26:01]** It's the third door on the right in this hallway, the first of the set of smaller bed spaces.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:11]** The running lights of the Voidcrier are a low blue, and you can't make out their eye as they start to...

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:12]** Excuse me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** Walk past you.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** Rick punches him in the nose.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:19]** No, um... Oh, God!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** What the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** I think Rick would just kind of let him pass.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:27]** Sorry, I'm on the map finally.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:40]** And I think Rick would... Not casually, but he's not rushing and he's not... He might look a little suspicious, but I think it's more just an awkwardness.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:45]** But Rick is just watching everything and trying to take in whatever he can.

**[00:26:45 - 00:27:02]** and i guess him and torv kind of zigzag past each other and and rick says excuse me and he's gonna torv doesn't say anything to you he just walks in he's gonna look down at bernice sitting in the hallway um and bernice is still awake at this point right you had her a century yeah

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:10]** So he's going to look at Bernice and say, can you please wake up the others?

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** I think something may be afoot.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:17]** And he's going to then go into the room where he hears his staying.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:18]** Okay.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:24]** So he assumes that Bernice is going to wake up the other two and that he's going to, well, there's no light in this room.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:24]** It's so dark.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:26]** How do I turn the lights on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:31]** Do you just walk into Hears' room and you just turn on the light?

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** We're bunking together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** Wake up.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:33]** Get up.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:36]** Yeah, we're bunking together, so it's my room.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Yeah, I drew the short straw.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:37]** All right.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** All right, that's fine.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:40]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:44]** I don't want to wake up dead.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** Well, I guess I won't wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:49]** Yeah, Rick's going to flick on the light, and he's actually going to start putting on his armor.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:50]** Okay.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:56]** And watch here and say, just whispering to him, like, hey, wake up, wake up, wake up.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** What time is it?

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:05]** Rick is going to look at his watch, and this is the first time he's looking at his watch, but he said that the game was like at 10.30, 11?

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** Is that right?

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:06]** If I remember correctly?

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:10]** It started around 10, sometimes two, two and a half hours.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** Okay.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** So is time affected?

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:15]** The time that I tell... That's a good question.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:19]** ...hears right now, I'm like, oh, it's midnight or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:24]** Is that a reasonable... It is 11.35 p.m.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:29]** And that's an unreasonable time period for a Baratis game?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:33]** That's a reasonable amount of time for a really short Brutaris game.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** The Brutaris game ended.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:37]** You were not near the end.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:41]** And the TV went... Two things, Brick19.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** Give me another perception check.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:48]** You hear down the hall, by the way, a set of heavy boots.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:50]** You think, maybe that's a fire spitter.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** A door opens.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** Boots walk in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** Two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:59]** It's probably Firespitter who left.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** 13 on my perception.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:04]** 13 on your perception.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** How many HP were you at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:08]** Why does that matter?

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** I have 29 out of 38.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:13]** Okay.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** You are now at full HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:16]** What?

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:17]** What is going on?

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** Is my resolve all back, too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** You are now at full HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:23]** How do I do full HP?

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:25]** But my resolve doesn't change.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** Your resolve has not changed yet.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** You haven't gone to sleep.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** I'm soaked.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** I'm soaked.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** Okay.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** You hear more boots walk down the hall.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Lighter.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** You can just barely make it out.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** Maybe if you peek out.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** I'm scared.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:46]** It's actually Sarzel who walks over and is walking into their room.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:49]** Closes.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** Here's what were you saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:54]** Here's asked Rick, what time is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:56]** And Rick will look at his watch and report that.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** 11?

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** What was that?

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** 1135?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** Why?

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** That is what my comm unit says currently.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** There's something wrong.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** There is something wrong here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** Okay.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** What's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:20]** And he's telling you this as he's pulling on his Defrex hide and slapping his battle axe to his back.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:25]** He's like, we were watching the game and the lights went off.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** The TVs went blank.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:34]** But what I noticed next was that the food, my drink was warm.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:40]** As if it had been sitting out for, I'd say at least an hour or so.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** It didn't make sense.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:49]** And now that I tell you the time, from my understanding of Brutaris, it should be much later than it actually is.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:52]** Something is not right on this ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:52 - 00:31:00]** Under normal circumstances, I say, you might be imagining it, but after everything we've been through, I'm not that surprised.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:06]** And he kind of gets to the edge of the bed and brushes himself off and starts to clothe himself.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Here's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:22]** Every five or so seconds since you've woken up, there's just a fleeting moment where you go to pull your shirt on or you go to just reach for something.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:28]** And it feels for a second like you just lose entire control of your body.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:31]** And then suddenly you're back into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** It's a brief fleeting moment.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** Do I notice anything else?

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:40]** Besides that, do things look different, kind of like you did with Rick and stuff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** I don't like this at all.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:46]** Rick19, you notice a few things.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:52]** One is that, Will, are you just opening doors?

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:55]** Hang on, I'm just opening doors on Foundry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:57]** It finally loaded.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:01]** I can't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:05]** That's how we know Will's in the game.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:09]** We can hear him opening doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** Even I am freaked out.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:14]** I'm like, I didn't plan for that.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:17]** Bernice has woken Dr. OK up at this point.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:20]** And he's curious what's going on.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:23]** But the rest of my map isn't loaded, so I don't know.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** I don't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:35]** Rick 19, you notice, do y'all want to turn on a light in Colin and, or Dr. Okay, do you turn on your light in your room?

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:36]** Yeah.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:37]** Okay.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** So that's not what I wanted to do.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:45]** Foundry on the fly.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:51]** Rick 19, you notice, I just put a light in there for Dr. Okay and Colin.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** Rick 19, you notice a couple of things.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:05]** I'm going to have Vinny and Will and Kelly take off their headphones because I want to tell Kevin something.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:05]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** No.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** Just real quick.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** Why am I the one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** Just like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** You'll be okay.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:12]** You'll be okay.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** We'll be back later.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:15]** We love you, okay?

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** All right, I'm going.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** Kev, you know there's a couple things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** I'm going to cry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** Just come on back.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:30]** There is a... As you're reaching, pulling on your armor, your right forearm feels stiff.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** You kind of look...

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:50]** Maybe right at the crook of your elbow, there's a blemish in your skin as if the android blood vessels underneath have been expressed to bring your bio android blood to the surface.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** It looks like a bruise.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** It's tender as you bring it in.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** And maybe you press your fingers around a little bit.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:59]** There's a small drop of blood there.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** comes out.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** That's one thing.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:06]** As you're looking at that and hears, you see hears.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** My skin's crawling.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** Thanks, John.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:14]** By all intents and purposes, hears, it seems to be moving.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** Fine.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** And then you think about it.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** Something looks a little off with hears.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:28]** You realize that one of hears is

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:48]** head antennae coming right out of the front of their face it's like two inches shorter than it should be what you rolled very well what was the check that you got a 19 on physical science and here's asked you for the time

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:54]** And you're thinking, Rick19 is trying to figure it out.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:58]** And even when you're explaining to hears, I know the length of a Brutaris game is this.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:04]** And something clicks in your head and you're like, let me open up my time again.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:08]** But not just the clock on the front of my data pad.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:13]** Let me go in to the actual clock app.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:21]** It is 1135 p.m., 24 hours later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:25]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** You can bring your headphones back.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:33]** You are good to bring your headphones back, as Kev groans.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:36]** Kev is sitting, not knowing what to do.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** I was not expecting this.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** I wasn't expecting this at all.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:44]** I was hoping to get a break.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:47]** I'm just going to watch the game, make some friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:51]** How many HP were you at?

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:54]** Well, I'm at full HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:54]** Okay.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:56]** So you've been at full HP even before you went to sleep?

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:59]** I honestly can't remember last episode.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** You might have hit long rest already.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:05]** I did hit long rest, not expecting to be interrupted, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:09]** Well, you don't regain full HP for long rest.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** Well, whatever I did.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:11]** No.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:13]** I thought you do.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:19]** I forget exactly what the rule is, but it's so many HP per constitution, I believe, or level or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** It ended up getting full, though.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:24]** Like, you know, I think I was high enough where it worked out.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:27]** But if you want me to take off points.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:27]** Don't worry about it.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:27]** You're fine.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:28]** Take off points.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:28]** You're good.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:31]** Doctor, okay.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:31]** He's like, you'll need it.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** I know.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** It's fine.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:34]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:38]** As you are sitting up, Bernice is working you up.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:43]** You realize that Rick has asked you to get up.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:47]** You, again, you look at your data pad.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** It's almost dead.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:50]** You thought you plugged it in.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** Maybe you just fell asleep.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** But as you're sitting up.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:59]** Your skin, you just notice, it feels really clean.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:03]** It feels probably cleaner than it's been in weeks.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:07]** I don't remember if you took a shower, but it feels like spa clean.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:14]** As if the skin has been nicely, you know, just moisturized and made clean.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:18]** And you feel like your insides are expressing this clean.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:22]** You're taking in the moisture in the air that's already been set in the room for your own humidity.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:23]** Yeah, it feels good.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:27]** Except your right arm feels really dry.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:36]** Like it's been hydrated and then dehydrated and then rehydrated and then dehydrated over and over and over again.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:41]** Like the skin just and it stops when it starts to connect to your body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Yeah.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** What's going on here?

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:48]** Can I do a medicine check to see what's what?

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:48]** Hit it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** Yeah, totally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:57]** I guess I'm rolling so I should know what my medicine is.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:58]** So that's 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** That doesn't just happen randomly.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:02]** Yeah.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** That doesn't just happen as a byproduct of some salve.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:05]** That's obvious.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** That's a deliberate decision.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** On top of that...

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:18]** It seems like it has been done, and yet the rest of you feels incredible.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:22]** And I think you were probably already at full HP, but you feel really great.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** And there's nothing wrong with it.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:25]** It works totally fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:36]** Can I do like a physical science check to see if it's like some sort of phenomena or like what would that be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:39]** What are you trying to see?

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** You're trying to see if it just happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:51]** I'm trying to see if there's anything like in the area or that I can tell about this ship or perhaps even, yeah, some sort of environmental effect.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** Drift or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** Yeah, it doesn't seem like an environmental effect.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:59]** It seems like the only way you could have reproduced this this many times.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:06]** Yet this had to be done deliberately in some sort with specialized equipment.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** It's not like you just spent the day in the sun.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:12]** It feels like it was inflicted on you.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** But there's no pain.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:16]** It just is hot and dry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:20]** Dude, we go through some battle, like, and we don't even know it.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** And we're, like, recovering.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** This is weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:27]** Could I use my custom micro lab to scan myself?

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:31]** Or like, I guess it's only a chemilizer.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:36]** So have there been any fluids that have entered my body and exited?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:47]** If you use the chemilizer, you feel very refreshed because of fluids that have been entered into your body.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** Your body has been revitalized.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** It has been rejuvenated.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:58]** any sort of wear and tear fatigue that you had pulled away.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:02]** Seems like they flushed out some fluids.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:07]** Like, like just like, there's like a sense that you went to the spa for the rest of your body, except for your arm.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** And here's, you are raising your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:19]** Here's is going to see if there's anything about his body that he can, else he could determine because he's been having that weird loss of control.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Um,

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:25]** So he rolls a physical science check, which has a plus nine, but only yields a 12 on this roll.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:29]** So has he sort of been through some engagement or something like that?

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:33]** Does he seem like he's like ill in some way or hurt or was hurt?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** No, you stand up.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:40]** And after a couple of times, that feeling of everything freezing goes away.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** You don't feel it.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:49]** In fact, your body also feels rejuvenated, and you stand up, and you look in the mirror.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:54]** Rick19 is standing next to you.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:56]** No, no, no, I don't want to see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:12]** So I think as you go to look in the mirror, Rick is finishing up his armor and stuff, and you see him kind of playing with his comm unit, and he says, here's... And he looks at you, and he squints, and he kind of like...

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** You see him do his memory thing.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:20]** His eyes kind of flicker because he's going back in his own memories.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:25]** And he says, is there something wrong with your antennae?

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** My antennae.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** Is there something wrong with his antennae?

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** I don't think so, right?

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:35]** Your right antennae is two inches shorter than it was before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:39]** Did it get cut, or is it just shrank?

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:43]** Can I do a medicine check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** Medicine check on him?

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** Yeah, I think I have medicine.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:45]** Let me double check that.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:50]** Medicine is probably like a plus two, maybe.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Medicine, plus six.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** Yay.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:55]** All right, let's see.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** Pretty good.

**[00:41:57 - 00:42:03]** And that's a seven total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:06]** You walk over and you critically failed.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:11]** You actually just pull it back and you're like, oh, no, it's the same length.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** It was just crooked.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:14]** Sorry.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:16]** You just crimped it in your sleeve.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:20]** No, I mean, you can tell pretty quickly that it has been sheared off.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** Sheared off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** Sheared off.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** That looks like what?

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** What happened while I was sleeping?

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** Did you see anything?

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:38]** No, as I tried to explain, I went out to watch the Protaris game, and something happened during that game, and then I came right back here.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** What happened?

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** The crew shamed...

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:50]** Was going to play a trick on the crew and blared loud rock music over the intercom.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:55]** I thought it was a joke as well until I noticed the drinks and the food were aged.

**[00:42:56 - 00:43:00]** And something I've just noticed, and he shows you his comm...

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:06]** He's got a data log of usage and power, and it skips.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** A day is missing.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:10]** A day.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:14]** It appears as if this has been a full day.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:21]** We've been on the Void Crier for at least 24 hours now, but it only feels like a few hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** We cannot catch a break.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** We should check on the others.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** I've already informed Bernice to wake them up.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** But yes, I think we should reconvene with them.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:34]** I guess here's we'll leave their room and make his way.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** Rick will follow.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:36]** He's already armored up.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** He's got all his weapons.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** He's ready for combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:43]** Here's opens the door to Dr. Okay.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:45]** And what the hell's with him?

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** Oh, Colin.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:46]** Here's.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:48]** I need to check out Colin, too.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** Hey, man.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** You doing all right?

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:55]** Where's that story coming from?

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:56]** Colin.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** I think Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:57]** Doctor.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:58]** Colin.

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** Hey.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** Colin, get up.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:01]** Get up.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:01]** Get up.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:02]** What happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:06]** Colin, you got all of your appendages in order?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:10]** Colin does a quick check to make sure everything is as it should be.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** Or to see if everything is as it should be.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:15]** He just checks them over there to make sure this is the case.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:17]** Is it, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:21]** How many HP did you have before you went to sleep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:26]** Before I went to sleep, I had 24 of 40 stamina and 29 of 34 HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** You were at full HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** I'm at full HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:37]** And as you sit up, bottom of your stomach, where it connects to your hip, feels a little sore.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:41]** You know, like when you sit up, you use your ab muscles.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:46]** It's like your lower abs got to work out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:46]** Yeah.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:49]** Just his lower abs though.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:49]** He's missing a kidney.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** He's waking up in a bathtub full of ice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** Ah, they took my kidney.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** They took my freaking kidney.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:59]** Candy Mountain, Candy Mountain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:02]** For some cheery ring up, step right on up to the Candy Mountain cave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** That's right, Candy Mountain.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:08]** It's a Neoplerodon, Charlie.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:12]** It's a magical Neoplerodon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:16]** Check out Charlie the Unicorn for all you kids who don't know what that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:23]** It's a magical Neoplerodon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** Kev, you're standing in the hall.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:31]** Yeah, I think before... Night, Rick.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** Thanks for coming by.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** Starts to walk into the elevator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:40]** And Rick's kind of going to glance at the others in the room.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:45]** And then he's going to step over Bernice to talk to Shay.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** Shay, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** I'm already in the elevator.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:48]** Goodbye.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:49]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** Oh, the door's closed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:56]** Hey, yeah.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** What's up?

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:00]** Puts a hand out to stop the elevator.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** What's up?

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Steps out to meet you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:05]** Have you noticed anything strange happening?

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:14]** I know that you planned the event with the rock music, and I'm sorry, that's one of the bands, Strawberry or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Strawberry Machine Cake.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:23]** Yes, and I did find that hilarious, but there's something... You don't know him, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:28]** There's... Have you noticed anything else around that time period?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:32]** Well, the TV went off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:32 - 00:47:01]** everything was a little warm I think maybe we were all just a little into our drinks trying to burn off some steam that's about it before I tell him my next thought oh no that's a natural one so I completely think he's talking straight and I'm gonna tell him I'm like can you please check your comm unit just verify the date for me yeah sure hang on pulls out little glasses put on their face

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:06]** And I'm assuming at least Dr. O can hear this because he's tied into Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:11]** And Bernice is going to roll a sense motive on Shay.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** Okay.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** What's your roll?

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:15]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:26]** Shay seems like you saying something is weird after the past day or two is like...

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:56]** sure maybe I mean I genuinely thought we were just watching a game it was odd that the TV went off and we lost it but you know you think weird stuff happens with the cast that you get when you're deep in the drift you get something from the info sphere could be weird do I have to roll another one for when he answers Kevin's sorry Rick's question about the time on the data pad the data

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** No, I'll just tell you.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** He overall seems honest.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:03]** There's not going to be a time where you have to keep rolling it.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:06]** It's like your roll will kind of stick through.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:08]** We'll stay through the whole course.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:10]** Yeah, it says 11.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:13]** How long does it take to don armor?

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:14]** Five minutes?

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** I think 10 rounds.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:17]** I forget.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:20]** I don't matter.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:22]** Yeah, it's like 1140.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:26]** Yes, but 1140 on what day?


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Hot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:52]** gives you a look and he i mean like rick blank stares at him what are you trying to say that's uh okay opens up the clock app you see their face look at the day you see them do the motion to refresh the app close the app try and open it back up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:56]** And Rick starts just nodding just a little bit at him.

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:00]** Like, you understand what I'm pointing at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:04]** Not that it matters.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** Light armor is four rounds.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** Heavy armor is 16 rounds.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** That's a lot.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** That's a lot of time.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:10]** Anyway, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** When you're in combat, at least.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** Yes.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** We are...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** 24 hours later than we should have been.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** Is that what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** It's only a minute and a half to say it.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:24]** 16 rounds is only a minute and a half.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:27]** No, that is exactly what I'm implying.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:37]** There is something off, and I want to make sure that... There hasn't been enough weird things going on in our world in the last...

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:41]** Is there anybody on board that you have no trust in?

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:44]** I want to start compiling a list immediately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** Yeah.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:47]** All right.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** Hold on, Investigator.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** I need to take stock of this.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** I got to talk about this with Darla.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Can you trust her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** Yeah, absolutely.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** With my life.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** Do I trust the Pykes Peritons?

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:03]** For the most part, they got us out of there.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** I trust them in that moment.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** They got us out of there.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:12]** I have some thoughts, and there's something that I want to check.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:16]** Narla, I think, went to the bridge.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** I'm going to go talk to her.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:23]** I will come find you, or if you have a question, just radio me on the comms.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:28]** But I want to confirm something, and I'm happy to help you with whatever.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:33]** Just before you start interrogating all the Pikes Peritons, just hang on a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:34]** Okay.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** You've been talking to Lozu?

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:50]** Look, my sister Lozu said... He's going to say... He's going to ask him, is this something that we should be concerned about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:53]** Yes, absolutely we should be concerned about this.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:56]** We are missing 24 hours.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:02]** Aboard the steward security vessel, the Voidcrier.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:04]** We should absolutely be concerned.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:09]** However, I'm going to ask that you keep this between you and your guests for just a moment.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** We are all trained professionals.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:16]** But please, let me talk to Narla.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** Are you sure you want to go alone?

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:23]** If it's something of concern, do you need us to join you?

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** Are you propositioning me?

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:29]** Depends on what you're... You're going to see him.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:38]** He's got his artillery rifle over his shoulder, and he just kind of pulls the strap a little bit and says, I am offering you protection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:42]** You are more than capable, as I've seen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** I'll be all right.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:50]** Clearly, whatever has happened in the next 24 hours, if there was something worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** Last 24 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** Sorry.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Yes.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:54]** I'm tired.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** I'm a little drunk.

**[00:51:56 - 00:52:01]** In the last 24 hours, then whatever happened, we're still here.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** Keep that head on a swivel.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:06]** I'll be back.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:06]** Copy.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** Walks into the elevator.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** What is he checking on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** He says he's going to go talk to Narla and check on something.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** I wasn't going to question that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** What is the something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Taking charge.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** That's what I wanted to know.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** What was the something that he's going to check on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** Do you want to roll a sense motive on him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:29]** It seemed like he had an idea.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:29]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** Oh, okay.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:34]** Yeah, I assume he's going to check logs or do something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** You don't need to re-roll a sense motive.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** Your 19 was good enough.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:47]** It seems like he's going to go, like, Rick 19 thinks, logically, going to talk to the captain, going to review ship logs and see what's going on.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** You could ask about that.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** You are more than welcome to follow up.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:56]** He said, radio me if you want to talk or ask about anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:03]** But I think just to rewind a little bit, like Dr. OK doesn't he might have heard that conversation, but he's not aware of the situation yet.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:09]** He just woke up and like so like Rick had like he was going to enter the room and talk to them and then saw Shay coming.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** So that's now Rick's returning.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** And I'm assuming Colin's awake.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:19]** So Rick is going to walk to the room and say like, are you all ready for another adventure?

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:22]** He kind of sighs like, ah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:28]** Here's like leaves against the wall, but face against the wall, slightly depressed.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:31]** And he's just going to like, he's going to roll detect magic.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** I don't know if this will do anything, but.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:34]** Yeah.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:35]** Yeah.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** Detect magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:40]** I think Rick's going to shut the door behind him as he comes in, leaving Bernice in the hallway.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** Oh, wait for Bernice.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:41]** She knows that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:45]** Poor Bernice.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** So Bernice comes into the hallway.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** She's our canary.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** Will, you can control Bernice, right?

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:52]** Yeah.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:54]** Can anyone really control Bernice?

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:56]** Okay.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:59]** Here we go.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:04]** So you come in and you shut the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** What are you all talking?

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:07]** What are you all doing?

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** I was rolling detect magic.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** That's right.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Thank you.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:09]** Apologies.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:14]** You don't detect any magic other than what you would normally detect on your person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:19]** Rick is going to start telling them what happened.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:22]** And he's going to inform them.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:25]** I went to join the Brutaris game.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:28]** Most of the crew and the Pykes were there.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** But something happened.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** Something strange.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** And I noticed that...

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:39]** The food and drinks seemed aged, for a better word.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:49]** Nobody else seemed to take note of that, except I will say that Torv, his eye had happened to change from orange to green.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:52]** I'm not sure what the settings are on his...

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:56]** optical nerve, but we can look into that later.

**[00:54:56 - 00:55:05]** One thing I am concerned about is I did notice on the comm unit that time has jumped at least 24 hours forward.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:07]** And I also have this.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** Dr. Roque, can you take a look?

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:20]** And he's going to pull off his armor from his forearm and slide up the mesh and reveal this.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** How did you describe it, John?

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:25]** It was like a blotch of skin bruised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:30]** And seems like it had been moved to express whatever is underneath your skin.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:34]** Whatever blood or biomatter you have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** Let me take a look, Rick.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:38]** I guess we're all medicine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:38]** Dr.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:57]** O.K., I think you can know without medicine that this is some sort of withdrawal via a needle device, probably several needles, very thin, meant to not leave that much of a scar.

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:04]** But it's clearly been done several times, and that's why the bruising is starting to really compound in Rick's skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:07]** Looks like... What's going on, Doctor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:11]** Someone's... What's this?

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:15]** Extracted fluid from you repeatedly, much like my arm.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:18]** And I show my arm, too.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:23]** Like, it's kind of... I don't know if it's withered or if it just looks like...

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** Like I'm peeling, like I got a sunburn or something.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:28]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:32]** Yeah, it looks really fine.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Looks totally fine.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** I feel like we're being experimented on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** Again.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:39]** Like grazing or something.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** It probably is what's happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:48]** So Colin lifts up his chest piece to try to inspect the area that's sore at the bottom of his abdominals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:51]** I feel like that's an anal probe that happened to Colin, unfortunately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:55]** You know, everyone else just got their arms like... How deep did they go, man?

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:58]** He's feeling it on his ass.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** GM, does he notice anything?

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** There are two things.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:03]** I never like it when John says, there are two things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:08]** Casually, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:10]** The first thing you notice...

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:13]** Well, let me just take a step back.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:15]** The first thing, let me just take a step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:17]** Let me just take a step back.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:19]** I'm going to need all of you guys to remove your headphones, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:24]** Colin, it feels stiff.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:26]** It feels like you've been using that muscle, right?

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:30]** Like it's been operated on.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** You just stand up.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:33]** You have to hobble a little bit.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** Maybe you pull down.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:35]** You pull up your shirt.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Pull down the top of your pants.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:42]** And there is a scar.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:52]** about two inches in length, running vertically from right at the bottom of your lower abs to the top of your pelvic area.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** Skin is tender.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** It's angry.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:56]** It's red.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** Your skin looks angry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** Oi.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** Shall we follow?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:03]** They took my freaking kidney.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:03]** Yeah, Colin.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** Well, that's the worst one so far.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:12]** It's like right on the front, right below your... It's almost centered with your navel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:15]** Well, looks like we're not to safety yet.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** All of you should suit up.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** You were talking to Shay, right?

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:22]** Yeah, let's get ready and let's follow him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:23]** I concur.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:25]** Shay said he was going to go check on something.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** I'm assuming he was going to speak with Narla as well.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:31]** He said to keep this between us, and he seemed authentic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** I don't know why he would want to keep it between us.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:39]** There's that mercenary group on board.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** That's the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:42]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** I think that's wise, what I was saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:49]** Okay, let's get to the bottom of this.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:51]** I guess we'll find out, right?

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:53]** Who's behind this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:59]** Colin, give me a mysticism check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:03]** Scrolling.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:04]** Mysticism.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:06]** 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:10]** 26, not bad, not bad.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:15]** You remember distinctly a hot day on Akiton.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:18]** You remember it was slow.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** Maybe you'd been there for a few weeks.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:23]** And you think,

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** That was a drag of a day.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** I didn't do anything.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:31]** I was not told to leave.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** There was no one to go see.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** There was no aid to administer.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:40]** So what do you do on a hot day in a place where maybe the AC was going in and out?

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** You put on the fan on the desk.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** You don't do much.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:49]** You put something on your data pad, connect to the Wi-Fi, watch some things.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:54]** One of the things you watched was a video clip.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** You just watch for fun.

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:00]** You're like, yeah, you're a trained medical professional.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** It's like Dr. Okay.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** Industry news.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** A little blurb.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:12]** You seem to remember that this idea has come to a resurgence.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:16]** New data has come to light, proving its effectiveness.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:22]** And you think to yourself, no, I'll watch it.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:28]** It's a silly thing, but I'll watch it because what else am I going to do?

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:37]** In the event of missing memories, you all don't know what happened in the past 24 hours.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:48]** The technique of hypnosis has been proven effective at recalling some of those memories.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:51]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:52]** Stop it!
