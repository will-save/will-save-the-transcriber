**[00:01:51 - 00:01:53]** It was so good that I don't remember.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** I can't speak to it.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:55]** It was so great.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** I don't remember exactly what happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:00]** What happens at Gen Con stays at Gen Con.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** And you all showed up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:05]** And then get stuffed into your luggage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** Games were played.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** Chaos was monkeyed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** Things were recorded.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:13]** Friends were made.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:13]** Yeah.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** Keep behind the scenes and we'll say we didn't go.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:18]** Yeah, we recorded it again.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** Kelly, how dare you?

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** I know.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:23]** I want them to listen to us and be like, wow, nothing happened apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:27]** We had such a good time with Adam and Emily and STF and all of those people.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:28]** We will be in general.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:30]** We drank many a hundred times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** By the time you listen to this, we will be gone.

**[00:02:32 - 00:03:01]** already and I hope it's a good time yeah I hope by now aren't we yeah it's gonna be a good time I guess we're gonna be hanging out with STF and Finder and maybe some other people we're gonna be living living together y'all will be living living yeah that's true I asked Finder but Will was like no I'm not gonna be at your Airbnb Will was like miss me with that shit I'm getting out of the room Will was like I wanna be able to leave I don't need to go home but I don't wanna stay here yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:08]** Will's out here trying to pitch a fraternity of actual play podcasters and yet he won't join the frat house.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** I'm too old for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** He's too cool for school.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:20]** I've rented a seven passenger van and there's nine people in the house so we're going to get creative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** It's going to be fun.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:24]** And not break any laws.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** No laws broken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:27]** I was able to fit federal or Indianapolis.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:30]** Federal or into Sudan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:41]** Kev's going to qualify our improvised seating arrangements for engineering inspection in case we ever get pulled over.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** It's more about hiding so you don't get pulled over in the first place.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** That's the key part of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:51]** So people are in the back.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** Don't you work on ball bearings?

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** Isn't that your thing?

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** I thought you had to go to a ball bearings convention one time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** Yeah, I go to a ball bearing conference.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** I thought that you went to a ball bearings meeting one time.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** No, I go twice a year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:04]** Kev is always talking about balls.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:09]** So then I was like, wouldn't you just throw ball bearings out so that they wouldn't get us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** I'm not going to throw ball bearing balls.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** Let's clarify that.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** Ball bearing balls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:22]** Kev, if we don't reenact a stunt from Fast and Furious while running away from a chase, did we go to Gen Con?

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** That's what Will would do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Yeah.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** That is what I would do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** I mean, that's what he does in D&D.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** The ball bearings.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** Yeah, it was great.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** Yeah, that's how he does.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:34]** If there were ball bearings in Starfinder, they would be out by now, rolling around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** Oh, yeah, totally.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** They'd be out.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:41]** There are no ball bearings in any machinery ever in Starfinder.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:43]** It's written on page one in the core rule.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:50]** To be fair, if you have the right ball bearing and you were to just throw the ball bearing, the whole assembly...

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:55]** It would probably disassemble and come like turn into like two rings and several balls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:58]** So this is not a ball bearings podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** It'd be a good way to hold your ball bearings.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:04]** And then you can just like fling a ball bearing or just put them in a leather pouch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:08]** Like, you know, normal people with ball bearings without the bearings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:08]** Yeah.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:11]** Like you just have balls.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** I always bring.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:13]** Yeah.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:16]** I always keep my ball sack with me at all times.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:16]** Yeah.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** They are always ready to go.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:19]** Just like whip it out and throw it at people.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:22]** Yeah, I'm just like, whoa, watch out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:27]** Listen, if you're on a narrow bridge with some wild wolves, nothing comes together in a pinch.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** Best way to do it.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** Like a ball sack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:33]** As long as you make sure that your ball is completely covered in oil, you're good to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** Lubricate it.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:41]** The thing you have to be careful of is you've got to make sure you trim the threads off of your ball sack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]** Otherwise... During the manufacturing process, yeah.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** The cage.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:49]** Or, you know, ongoing maintenance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:55]** Yeah, but some people when inspecting them do actually like to have them untrimmed.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:58]** So it just kind of depends on who your inspector is, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:03]** Yeah, if they prefer that more velour sensation or the burlap sort of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** It doesn't affect performance either way, right?

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** The balls will still bear.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** It's exclusively personal preference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** I'm not sure we're talking about the same balls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:14]** Between you and your ball sack inspector.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** So the balls can bear things.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:18]** Okay, cool.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** That's what Kev does.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** And with that, Gen Con was great.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** We had a great time.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:27]** Everyone asked to see Kev's tattoos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** All seven of them, I think I have them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** Kevin is going to show all of them.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** And where they're placed.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:38]** If you ever meet Kevin out in the wild, ask about his ball bearings and his tattoos.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:44]** With that, Kelly, you didn't say the sentence last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:45]** Oh, f*** me.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** I got you.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** I got you.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** All right.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:48]** You know what?

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** This is the episode.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** Third time.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** It's this episode.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:51]** The third episode.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** It's this episode or not at all.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** I'm going to do it.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:54]** I'm going to do it.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** And it's going to be great.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:58]** Can't wait.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:58]** Can't wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** Can you somehow?

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** I'm just going to keep typing sentence.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:02]** I'm just going to set a timer on myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:03]** I'm going to just.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:04]** I'm going to.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:04]** Yeah.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** I'm so excited.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** You're going to scream it.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Should I pretend like you've already said it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** It's going to be an audible timer.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:14]** It's going to be like, and then Kelly's going to be like, I like potatoes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:20]** I'm setting a timer right now for an indeterminate time.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** That's exactly what it's going to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:24]** Someone give me a number between 1 and 90.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** Actually, let's say 1 and 60.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:32]** I'm going to choose not that one so that no one knows when this is going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** So what was the purpose of that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:34]** I don't know.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** I changed my mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:38]** Just throw it in a random number generator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** Yeah.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** Roll a dice.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** Yeah, roll some of your sweet die.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** Alright, with that, I have it.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** Roll a d100 or something.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:48]** Let us play.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** Let's play.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:51]** Bang!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** You have that drop, right?

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Like the suspense drop.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** I don't know.

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:00]** Oh, that was a failure on my part.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** Yeah, there it is.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:01]** Thank you for that.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** That was good.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:03]** I really nailed that one.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** Good stuff.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:06]** Here we go!

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** Here we go, y'all.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** Because last time.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** Last time.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:14]** On we'll save.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:16]** Boy, you know, it's eerie in here.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** It is eerie indeed.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** Ah, Huel.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:23]** As you all, Huel always knows the right thing to say.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:28]** As you all are back behind the steward's lines in the restricted area.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:33]** You tried to, you left the party, made a splash, as Dr. O.K.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** said.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** Except for Rick.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** Rick didn't, but Dr. O.K.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:37]** did.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:42]** You all jammed the door going into the hallway.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:49]** You tried to charm Red, who was watching over the checkpoint.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** I thought it would work because he's kind of dumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** It didn't.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** But instead... He's not dumb.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** Instead, he did... He's really friendly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:01]** He has the will to be saved from the will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** Exactly.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** His mod fire is huge, isn't it, though, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:08]** Yeah, he has the biggest ball bearings that anyone does.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** That somehow add to his will.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:13]** That add to his will save.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:16]** Rick19 successfully, though, was like, hey, you know, I was going to the party, too.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** And Red's like, you know what?

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** That sounds all right.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:19]** I'll walk you back.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:21]** That's fine.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** Starts to go back.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** Says, hey, actually, party's that way.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:25]** There's an after party.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:28]** Maybe you'll see it later if you're cool enough.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:29]** If I see your tattoos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:34]** Actually, I don't have any tattoos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** No, he didn't say that.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:59]** then but you kind of got the sense that he no i mean like you truthfully got the sense that he was kind of like there's an after party like like like trying to be cool you know to be like i know something you don't and he's on the inside yeah and in that six minutes the entire party ended they took shots and then dissipated throughout the building

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:04]** Well, keep in mind, too, that you all went back to the room and talked for a little bit.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** At least 15 minutes to walk through stuff.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** I have an advanced time forward.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:11]** But you did talk through what you're going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** Confirm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:19]** I think overall it's about 15 minutes in general.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** Rick stayed at the party a little longer.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** Colin walked over, said hi to Red.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** Ben went back over.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** Then you went to look for Colin.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** Time passed.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** Not much.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:31]** About 15 minutes or so.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:37]** You all sneak into the command center as you all join up.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:43]** You see that in the command center as I bring you back to the map here.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:47]** You see in the command center that Dr. Okay.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:53]** And here's starting to look at the, at the computers that are behind the monitor screen.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** There's no one in there.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** There's a door in the back of the command center that Colin surmises.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** This is probably inspector Hurd's office.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:07]** Rick is standing point outside next to the training center, keeping an eye on everything that's happening.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:13]** And then the door opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** Close the control door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:20]** Maybe we'll just assume that that was close.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:20]** That's fine.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** Probably close by itself.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** It's okay.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:26]** Although they can see it because the windows, that's the thing.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:30]** So maybe it's better to have it open.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:30]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** Who knows?

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** Well, maybe we can open it up on our turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** Just tell me what I rolled for initiative.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Hang on.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:41]** Rick19, I'm moving you back where you were.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** Will, don't worry.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:42]** We're getting there.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** I purposely haven't said it on purpose.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** Don't worry.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** Gaslight.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** I'm not trying to gaslight you.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** I just haven't told you yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:48]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:58]** Yeah, Rick hears the door, and he's going to step forward, and then make clear eye contact with...

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:19]** whoever's inside the control room right now which is going to be here's and dr okay which one of them should look up and see rick and he's gonna just kind of look at him and then like do like two fingers or eyes over okay oh i'm gonna get set in the comms there's we got movement and then he's gonna just he did say that okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:30]** I was going to say you all have a chance to roll a stealth roll or move if you want to up to your speed in the time that the door opens and given Rick's saying, hey, we got movement.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** So Rick 19.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** Well, here, one sec, Rick, are you just going to step forward and stand in the open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:36 - 00:13:00]** yes okay he's he's gonna walk down to the to the door itself the first door it's okay right so there's two there's two doors on the warehouse there's the one door and then there's the double doors um below it yes and red told him to go through the top door so he's at that door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:00]** Okay.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** So you're not doing a stealth check, but you are moving?

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:03]** Yes.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:04]** Okay.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** Colin, here's Dr. Okay.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** What are you going to do?

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** Stealth, you said, Dr. Okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:10]** Okay.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:10]** Okay.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:13]** Is it here's or Rick that can turn invisible?

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Here's.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:15]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:22]** And he's going to do that, but I just don't want it to be a waste because it can make a person.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:22]** Question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:24]** Not a terrible roll, not a great one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** 23.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:26]** Rough.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** 23.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:29]** Here's is invisible, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** Here's goes invisible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:34]** Did here's get a full rest last night?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** Yes, it did.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** We clarified that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:55]** don't waste your spell bro this is meta as shit but like here's here's a reaction here's already went invisible dr k sorry what again was your roll 23 23 nice i'm gonna move down and hide behind the door okay what's your role i rolled a stealth and it was garbage rick so i have to do it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** Okay, that's fair-ish.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:59]** Thirteen to hide behind a door.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** Thirteen to hide behind a door.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** I don't tell you how to kill things.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** Stop telling me how to use my magic.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** That's because you don't know how to kill things.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** The door opens.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** Okay, here's how to kill things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:17]** The door opens and Shay Dysha is talking to somebody behind them and then turns and starts to walk down the hallway and goes, Oh, hey, Rick, hey.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** And behind Shay, you see Ezra.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** Walk in.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:22]** Kev.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** And Ezra's like... Ezra's one of the paratons.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** Yeah, he's like... Who the fuck is Ezra again?

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:26]** How's it going?

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:27]** Kasathan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:28]** Hey.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** How's it going?

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** Yeah.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:31]** Oh, hey, guys.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** Are you headed to the after party?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** Yeah.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:37]** Rick, what are you doing back here, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:40]** I was just heading to the after party.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:45]** I was told the after party is in Dr. Nodin's office.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:46]** No.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:49]** No, it's actually in the training center behind you.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** You coming?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:56]** But Red told me that Dr. Nodens was hosting the party.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** Did Red lie to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** Red is an idiot.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** Why don't you just go ahead and go back to the party right now?

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Yes, I did.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:04]** And I'll invite you later, okay?

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:09]** And here he goes and pushes open the door that is to the left.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** To your left, so that way you can go through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:13]** You know what?

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** Keniko was right about all of them.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:15]** She really was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:44]** where yeah rick steps into the into the warehouse okay and shay keeps walking and they walk over door shuts behind you rick i guess uh no he's gonna put his hand and just hit and just kind of hold it so it doesn't slam shut okay and let it go slow ezra and shay walk into the train and the door shuts then rick reopens the the warehouse door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:48]** Shay rolled really poorly on the perception check.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** That's good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** Maybe a few too many.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** Everything's quiet for a sec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** What does the computer do?

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:56]** It's actually a training center and not a portal to another dimension.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** I'm so sad about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:02]** You all, I assume, go back to your operations, to where you were?

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:03]** Yeah.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Dr.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:13]** O.K., you are able to look into the computer.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:16]** You see that it's a Tier 3 computer with a Security 2 upgrade.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** You needed a DC-27 to hack it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** Sorry, can we pause for just a half a second?

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:27]** It was Shay and Ezra the Periton.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** What did Kaniko say about Ezra?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:38]** Kaniko said that Svetch, who is Sparkles, and a few others went back.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:43]** And you think, Rick, maybe that was the door that you heard when you first were walking through with Red.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:48]** But did Ezra seem like he wanted to go back there?

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:51]** Ezra seemed really compliant.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:57]** Can I do... I mean, like, it moves so fast, but like... I know it moves fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** He seemed really like... He was like, hey, Rick.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** He was like really happy.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** Definitely feeling it.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:04]** Really feeling the party, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** I don't like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** Really feeling the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** They're all great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:18]** And here's... Computer comes up.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** You see five things.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:32]** There's an alarm that you can select, turn on or off, that will alert the base personnel via their comm units that can be started or shut down here.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** So it's an all-call alarm, right?

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** That's one thing.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:44]** You notice that the computer has base schematics, which you already have, right?

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:52]** And you see that there is a hard wire to the control module for the hanger doors and the garage doors, just like you were told.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:59]** Though that could be acted by like anybody who manual actuation.

**[00:17:59 - 00:17:59]** Yeah.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:02]** So like you can just, you can hit it and it can go.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:13]** You notice that there is a connection to, this is the third thing that there's a connection to another terminal that

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:22]** And with your understanding, you think this is probably the terminal in the room behind me, which is probably Inspector Heard's private offices.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:27]** So you have a connection there if you want to try and get into that terminal.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:30]** Conversely, that terminal could get into this terminal.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:40]** Fourth, you're able to pull up a couple files, see very clearly the surveillance footage.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:44]** that they have in both of your rooms.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:55]** You can see that there's a set of logs that right now it's currently showing the one room that was here's and Rick's.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:59]** And then the other one that you have playing you playing Akita, right?

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Terraforming Akita.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:05]** You can see that there's a set of logs, um,

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:36]** that show when something happened they note when you woke up they note when you went to sleep there's a note saying that inspector heard is undecided on any other means of surveillance you also notice that there's a communications module that is behind a firewall that you would need to hack into if you want to get it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:40]** I missed all of that because you came in garbled for a moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:43]** The last thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:50]** Probably from the fourth thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:51 - 00:20:20]** screens tracking us so the fourth thing is the feed of the video and the audio coming in from both your rooms and the logs that show what you're doing and that they have decided they have not decided what to do with that information yet or nor have they decided to try any other means of surveillance yet on you and the fifth thing the fifth thing is that there is a communication control module behind a firewall

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:26]** While, while let's just put a pin in that for a second, Rick and Colin, let's come back to you.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:28]** What are the two of you doing while he is a doctor?

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:28]** Okay.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** Are going through this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:37]** I think Rick is standing in that, in the open door of the warehouse and just perceiving everything.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:42]** And I think he, he's just, he feels comfortable where he's at, that he can play dumb.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:43]** Yeah.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:46]** Play dumb and work in and out of this room.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** Be like, Oh, I'm heading here.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** I'm heading back.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** Blah, blah, blah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:49 - 00:21:12]** okay okay um colin is going to step to the door and listen to see here if there's anybody in there give me a perception check colin so sorry i can't see but is colin colin is in dr herds no he's in the command center right now okay uh that's a 19 you don't hear anything back there

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:35]** do you want to do anything i want to webcam i really want to open the door but i don't know if it's alarmed i want to check to see if it's alarmed first you want to check to see if the door is alarmed okay i don't know if i can do that do you have computers or engineering nope okay cool colin colin's gonna colin's gonna open it

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** Colin opens the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:41]** Dr. OK, and here's you.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:43]** Maybe here, Colin, open the door.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** But what are you trying to do right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:49]** I'm going to disable the all call module.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:54]** And I'm assuming I'll try to help you with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** So that way no one can disable the all call.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:01]** They would have to come here and start the all call.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** And you're trying to disable that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** Sorry, what's the all call?

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** I missed that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:09]** The all call is an alarm to say, hey, there's an alarm.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** Like, it's just an all base alarm.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:13]** It goes to all personnel's comm units.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** Got it.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:18]** Yeah, I want to disable with, I don't have root access, right?

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** You said this was a tier three computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:22]** Tier three computer with a security two upgrade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** Oh, so it's only security two?

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:25]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** Oh, wow.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** And how come the DC to hack was 27?

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** What are you asking?

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:40]** Well, okay, so I want to know if I can even get root access on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:46]** You would need to... It's like 41, right?

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:49]** Yeah, it's 20 higher than the DC for the computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:50 - 00:23:13]** okay um so it need to be 47 yeah so i'll just try to disable the all call alarm module and then i'll try to do the um communications module okay the communications module is behind a firewall so you can hack the firewall to see what's behind the communications module just want to make that clear okay i'll try to do that okay

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:16]** Go ahead and give me a computer's check.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:23]** There is... And here's a... And Bernice, I'm assuming, are still helping out.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:26]** I rolled... Yeah, I've already rolled two assists.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:33]** I rolled a 26, uh, plus... Uh, here's... And...

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** Okay.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** Bernice, however, does not.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** So it's 28.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** Okay.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** So it's a 28.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** You are not able to get in.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:51]** You're very close, but you are not able to get in to the communications module and breach the firewall to get into the communications module.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:53]** Okay, here's try separately or after you assist it, you can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:54 - 00:24:06]** I think that you maybe have one more check that you could do here, but then we're starting to get into the, like, take 10, take 20 territory, which is a little... Yeah, should I disable the alarm, or do we care about the... But there's nothing on that computer to...

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:15]** So there's the alarm, there's the surveillance logs, there's the hangar doors and the garage doors, and then there's the connection to the terminal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:18]** I thought the hangar doors and the garage doors I could just do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:19]** Okay.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:23]** You don't need to roll a check for the doors.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** You don't need to roll a check for the all call.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** You don't need to roll a check for the surveillance.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:31]** You would need to roll a check to hack into the computer that is in the office behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** So that's the only thing we're rolling for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** Or rolling to access the communications module.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:36]** That's it.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** So there's only two things that you would need to roll for.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:44]** Get through the firewall into the communications module or hack the computer behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:50]** We probably have time for one more thing before I disable some of this stuff and open the doors.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** What do you guys think?

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:55]** Should I try to get Heard's information or try the communications again?

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:59]** Or Heard's, do you want to try?

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:01]** I think your computer is actually slightly better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** I have the signal jammer.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** Is the all comms necessary?

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** Let's find out more on H.E.R.D.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:06]** Okay.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** Colin, you open the door.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** If it's not necessary, then.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** You open the door.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** It's a square office.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Super steward office.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** Clearly official steward office.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:21]** There's an air of authority, a wide desk with blue, dark wood.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:26]** And then which behind there's a single tall matching chair with gold accents.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:29]** There's a holographic terminal in the desk.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:31]** It's pretty clear two chairs in front of it.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:38]** A small round table with a few chairs provides kind of a formal, like a, like a less formal meeting spot in the corner.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:42]** Um, there are framed pictures that dot the sky blue walls.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** Some are documents.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** Some are diplomas.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:49]** Others are pictures of starships from versus or of steward origin, um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:49 - 00:26:10]** couple displays of commendations and medals all around the room any papers or things around that i could does he have his password on a post-it note he doesn't know all right there's there's there's another computer in here but i'm i've got no idea how to use it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:17]** The room feels stuffy, and there's a door, you realize, off to your left in the top northeast corner.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:19]** There's a door that probably goes into private offices.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Or, sorry, like private quarters.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:23]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** I'm going to move the time forward another 15 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:28]** Cool.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** I want to listen at that door to see if anybody's inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:40]** And while we do that, all of you get a quick ping from Koneko saying, status, question mark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:46]** Uh, I'm going to say like T minus what?

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** Four or five minutes.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:54]** I mean, we're going to try and hack and get, um, what's his name's files, right?

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Okay.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:55]** Jock's heard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** I think that's the way forward.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** I saw Ezra.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:01]** He was heading into the training room with Shay.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:03]** That is where they are holding their after party.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:06]** Have you seen Inspector Hurd?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:09]** He was in the hangar still, presumably.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** Unless he left.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** We could ask Nico.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** Why don't I message her real quick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** We're talking to her.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:15]** She just pinged us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** I know, but she's there.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** Oh, is that what you were just saying?

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** She's on comms, isn't she?

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:20]** Were you just talking to her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:21]** Yeah.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** Well, she sent you a text.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** Oh, okay.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** Well, then he's texting back then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** Saying what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** What I just said.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Okay.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** Saw Ezra period.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:34]** Uh, here's in Dr. Okay.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** If you wanted to, you could also try and like split up.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:49]** Like, I don't want to, I don't know that you can take 10 or 20 and do a million computer checks, but if you wanted to like still try and get behind the communications module and go into hers computer, like I'll give you that opportunity to try and do both if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:49]** Yeah.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:52]** I just don't know that we'll roll high enough on our own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:54]** Okay.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** That's a 19 perception.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:56]** 19 perception.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** You don't hear anything back there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:03]** I say to here, it's like, hey, you want to give a crack at this real quick?

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:05]** I'll assist and Bernice will help out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:08]** The comms module or the Hertz computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:12]** Because Rick assures us that we don't need to do the comms module thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** So if that's true, then we can just... Well, we don't know what's behind it.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:19]** It might be like a filter, a data filter or something, I'm guessing, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:35]** there's a firewall that's preventing you from getting inside to see what is being sent to where right that's a little point yeah oh well then i can write okay so it's herds or like firewall to see all the messages that everyone's you could do both you could do one of each if you want


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:38]** Alright, uh, well, here's rolls.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** See, I don't know, like, it's a 26.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:47]** I guess, let's start with Herd, because that's a lower one, and I'm guessing, and then, uh, that's what Dr. Okay rolls.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:50]** Dr. Okay assists, and Bernice assists.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:55]** Alright, so for Herd's whatever, we have a 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:55]** 30, okay.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** And...

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:06]** I imagine in this moment, there must be a lot of adrenaline that's starting to also leave your body, but maybe some of you are staying calm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** Chris is hungry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** He's like, I'm so hungry, I could go for some chicken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:18]** I almost stole some hors d'oeuvres to go, but I, alas, forgot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:22]** I can get you some of those kafok larvae, if you'd like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:25]** Hey, there's a door over here.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** There might be some snacks behind it.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:29]** Colin, do you open the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:36]** God, he's going to do a will save and intelligence check.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** He's not Chuck, man.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:38]** Yes, he is.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:43]** He's the opposite of Chuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Clicked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:46]** Where's my level-headed boy, Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** Clicked, meaning you opened the door?

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:47]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:50]** Being in love has turned against me.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** A foolhardy gunslinger, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:56]** Let me read what you see in Jock's Herds.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** One of Jock's Herds' rooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Hanging from the ceiling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:06]** And then I'll say... It's Captain Rameem from the Chimera.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** Oh my god.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:18]** And then I will say what Dr. O'K and hears find as they pass their computer check to get into Jock's Herds' computer.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:23]** Colin, you open the door and you see again another austere room.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** It's cold.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:27]** It feels cold, looks cold.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:36]** There's a glass table that kind of stands at attention, we'll say, in the center surrounded by two chairs and a couch upholstered with more blue.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:40]** A bookcase holds some more memorabilia related to the stewards.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** There's a reading chair beside it.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:51]** There's an animated digital painting of Versys and a blue rug that, again, ties the room together with the strong Stuart symbol.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:55]** The corner of the rug kind of touches a little kitchenette.

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:04]** You see in the memorabilia a complete set of Stuart's legal cases dating back to the formation of the pact.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:08]** Historical texts of famous battles with Vesk and the Swarm.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:18]** You see a photo of Hurd shaking hands with the Stuart Director General Lynn Camulon and being awarded a Medal of Valor.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:22]** You see a model of a famous ship.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** From history.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:27]** There's a door to your far left and a door right in front of you.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:34]** You think the door to your far left, if you know your geography of the space, that probably leads back out to the hallway.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:38]** The one in front of you probably goes to... Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:45]** Here's... You open up.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:49]** The computer...

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** has a couple of things.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:59]** One, you can see that it is a, that it has a connection to the one that you're in, right?

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:02]** You can see that architecture.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:11]** You mostly just see mundane stewards records, personnel files, command logs.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:18]** You see a log saying that you would like to

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:22]** seal the chapel because of an unnerving presence.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:32]** You see inventories and lists of the Larvoca Fox and other, again, the luxury items that you saw in the warehouse that you thought were kind of weird.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:38]** You see the general layout of operations and SOPs.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:58]** This is a base meant to keep an eye out for escapees from the prisons here, miners, travelers who need rescue, who are near the moon or on this moon, and occasionally a staging point for stewards, ops, missions.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:00]** And you see another secure data module.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** Another secure data module.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** Yeah.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:03]** Okay.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:05]** Well, here's is going to try to get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:10]** Canico responds back to you and says, Roger ping me with a countdown.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Who is Roger?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** I didn't know Roger was a part of your team.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** You don't know Roger.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:18]** No, no way.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:19]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:25]** Roger's in the room with you right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:28]** Is that, is that, is that the guy you told me not to worry about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:32]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** Rough, rough, rough, rough.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** Okay.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** Here's roll to 25.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** Here's roll to 25.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** Could I get some Aussies?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:40]** Yes.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:43]** Dr. Okay, assist.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:47]** And Bernice nails it with a 20 to assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:48]** 29.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** The DC was 29.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:53]** Woo!

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** All right.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Better be juicy.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:02]** Not his wishes and hopes and dreams.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:03]** His private journal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:04]** It's her dick pics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:11]** Dear diary, today, the team from Outpost Omicron got mad at me.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:17]** I sobbed for hours in the training room next to a waterfall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** I don't know how to keep them happy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** I don't know.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:22]** How do I, does my team like me?

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** I don't know.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:32]** So Canico has pinged you asking for a countdown to when you're going to open the hangar doors.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:36]** Rick 19 is in the warehouse waiting, probably listening on comms as people are talking.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:41]** Colin, I'm assuming that you're relaying all this information on the rug.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:45]** He's taking a piss on the Stewart symbol.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** Here's in Dr. Okay.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:49]** You are, you're, you're talking, you're probably narrating.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** This is kind of what I'm thinking.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:53]** You're narrating what you're reading, what you're seeing.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** There's just inventories.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:57]** There's just senior personnel's files.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:58]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** There's this other module.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:02]** Let me see if I can just see what's there.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** And you're talking.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:13]** You're trying to go through and just see like, what is this?

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** You're trying password.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** Have a workaround.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:19]** You get in and you're like, oh, yeah, got it.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** I'm assuming...

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:32]** that is, hears in Dr. Okay start reading that you you stop talking.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:50]** You see that all the files of all the stewards on the base save for

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** One of them.

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:10]** You see confirmed that all the stewards, all the workers, the inspector general and over your pike are all reptoids.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:21]** They have recently replaced the previous leader of the Pyke's Paratroops, Orvier Pyke.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** They've replaced some Knights of Galarian.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:30]** They have replaced all except for one steward, Silverton.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:34]** F***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:34]** F***.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:40]** Koneko is next on the list to take out.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:58]** But the note from Dr. Nodens contemptuously says that she displays a genuine compassion and a sense of justice that a replacement must train to replicate, lest the change in her demeanor is too drastic to go unnoticed in the short term.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:07]** Also contains records of communications, bundled packages of

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:22]** You see the logs of them being sent through Terrapin Station, through the communication module, to, let's say, Reptoid Masters on Roselight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** Invasion of the freaking Body Snatchers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** What do Reptoids have to do with greys, man?

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Is this the third fold?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:35]** Within the past six months, you think.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** They have taken over.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** Started about a year ago.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:42]** And for about six months, they've been mostly entirely in control of the base.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:48]** Does everyone know what a Reptoid is in Starfinder terms?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** Starfinder story time!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:50 - 00:38:15]** creepy star finder story time they are also want to know how they take control masters of disguise and deception don't read too much will don't go too deep but yes i'm just let john explain it okay i will truthfully probably just check i just haven't checked to see what site you're at so i don't know if they're gonna say something archives in net that's probably fine it's probably fine they are


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:43]** alien archive page 92 evil shapeshifters yeah that's fine cruel insidious and i like this inimical to sapient life absolutely conspiracy fodder that many many stories saying that they have found a reptoid hand saying that someone they know started acting differently

**[00:38:45 - 00:39:09]** they are from what you know at your base level now reading this word hairless green-skinned humanoids reptilian features claws incredibly powerful claws you know that they have a love for power a love for an unquenchable thirst for power

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:32]** an unquenchable thirst for power uh a a a love for like mind control psychic abilities enhancing their psychic abilities taking over that's what you find um so i guess can we download this like uh evidence for later sure so so does the list have the peritons on there too no

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:39]** It is all of the Stewart's base, except for Silverton, the only one that was not.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:43]** And Orvier Pike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:46]** And Canico's on the list to be replaced next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** Canico is next on the list.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** Sorry, say that again about Orvier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:54]** Orvier Pike is on the list as somebody who has been replaced.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** Okay.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** But Silverton is not.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** Silverton is not.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** And Koneko is next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Koneko is next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:00]** Yes.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:03]** Here's tells everyone this.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** All right.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:12]** Guys, long story short, everyone here besides Koneko, thankfully, and Silverton, annoyingly, are Reptoids.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Even Red?

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** You're familiar with this, right?

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** You know what Reptoids are?

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:37]** uh i don't know should we do a culture check each of us to know how far they're body snatchers they're not they're not who they're evil body snatchers basically everyone here and a terrapin station they've been replaced and at rosebud there's some of them rosebud conspiracy going rose light


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:39]** They have sent data.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** They have sent things.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:45]** You just see logs of the transaction of something being sent.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:48]** In order to find out more, we'll have to see.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** But they've sent it to people at Roselight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** On Roselight.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** Did you hear what I said?

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:58]** I'll send her the file through the comms, probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:01]** We'll have evidence for you later, Doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** Sorry.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:08]** Wait, can you... They're reptoids, Kaniko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Everyone is.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** You were right about Orvier.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:13]** They've been body-snatched.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:15]** They're not who they say they are, except for Silverton.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** Wait a minute.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Don't trust anyone.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:20]** All of the Peritons, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:23]** No, just Orvier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:23]** Okay.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** Oh, my bad.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** Okay.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:25]** All the other parents.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** I need to.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** Okay.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:28]** It's an important distinction.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:28]** I need to tell them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** Just can we open the fucking hangar doors and go?

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:33]** I need to tell my crew right now, guys.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:39]** And then she cuts out as she's trying to start to send fucking text to her entire team.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** Yeah.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:42]** She's trying to send an entire team.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:46]** Do we want to try and do the communications thing real quick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:52]** Rick changes his gun back to his artillery laser, like his lethal weapon.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:59]** And then you see in his hand a signal jammer, and he just says, open the doors and let's go.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:04]** And you see him cocking his giant rifle over his shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:05]** All right.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** I guess I do concur with Rick.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** All right.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:12]** Do we have to roll for that, or is that just a simple press a button?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:14]** You want to open the hangar doors?

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** Yeah, we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:17]** I mean, do we want to try and get the communication?

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:21]** Are you telling us, John, to get the communications also or try to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:27]** You feel like you've gotten some understanding that communications roughly go to Terrapin.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:36]** You are not sure of the information that was sent through Terrapin, but all communication here, and this is not abnormal, is like kind of under a dome, right?

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:41]** Like this is a planet wide comm unit because all the comm unit here is sending directly to Terrapin.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** It is strictly controlled.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:44]** Everything goes in and out of Terrapin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:48]** I kind of want to see where this evil goes, but... All right, I'm doing it.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:51]** Hang on, that's the last thing we're doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** Do I hear anything at this door?

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** You don't hear anything at the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** Cool.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** Dr. Okay and Bernice assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** Colin opens the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** Colin opens the door.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** Fuck it.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:03]** It's only a... It's only a 21.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** 21.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:04]** Yeah.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Colin opens the door.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** And then an assist of both.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** It's like 25, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:09]** 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:12]** Let's blow the... Let's just...

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** Let's just get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** It's not enough to get in.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** Colin, you walk in.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** It didn't work.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** We don't have time to try again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:22]** I say we blow this popsicle stand while we still can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** There is a bed.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:26]** There is a nightstand.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** It looks like it is barely used.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:33]** You think that you see a Mark II culinary synthesizer.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:39]** You see in the bedroom, though, very quickly, you see kind of just shoved into a corner a

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:44]** A gold and a gold and silver holy symbol of Yomadai.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** All the silver parts are tarnished.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** It's all scratched.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:51]** It is worth 250 credits.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:55]** And you think to yourself, you're like, I just heard that they're reptoids.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:55]** Like, what is this?

**[00:43:55 - 00:44:02]** And then you think you think about how there's that unnerving, settling, like unsettling feeling when they go into the chapel.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:12]** And then you realize that like the evil alignment of the Reptoids when entering into the chapel, Yomide, like her symbol, her presence there made them feel on nerves.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** That's why they put the shroud over Yomide.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** That's why they have otherwise shut down the chapel.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** They've sealed it.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:22]** The only person who can go in is Joxer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** Okay.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:27]** He grabs all of that and brings it back with him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** Grab the Yomide symbol.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** They don't like it.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:37]** You said Herd and Astera are both Reptoids?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:41]** Everyone here is a Reptoid except for Silverton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:47]** So why would Astera smell like incense of Yomida?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:49]** Because I don't think Astera was a Reptoid at that point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:56]** Because, or, I'll just say, because, like, he wasn't the only person to go in there, maybe.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:59]** Maybe she was also part of the, one of the people there to help shut it down.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** Help, like, blow out the candles, take shit out.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** Because they were moving the stuff.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:06]** Right, because they were, like, getting rid of all that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:11]** Let's blow all the doors and, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Can he go blowing doors now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:45]** yeah I want to as I see them start to come out the control room you're gonna open the doors yeah Rick is gonna move up and to the door of the training center and try to put his binders he's got a set of binders and he's gonna try to lock the door manually manually lock the door like yeah with binders like put a bike on it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:45 - 00:46:14]** interesting okay yeah go ahead and give me a yeah give me an engineering chart or physical science 15 15 okay you put it on there and it's really it's really flimsy it really doesn't stay you think this is like this is not really going to work


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:19]** And then he's going to step back and raise his gun at the door, knowing that there's people back there.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:22]** He's just got his artillery laser up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:51]** shoot if anything moves okay dr okay i see you moving across the way colin i see you moving stepping out so who is the person pushing the open door symbol i guess here is yes well yeah because dr okay left so just want to make sure that we're capturing that so colin left dr okay left just push it just just write a little cron script and have it have a do it 30 seconds after we we all leave


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:59]** I'm like, the intrusive thoughts are like, should I just toss this symbol into the training room and see what happens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** No more random things from you.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:05]** No more random things from you.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:09]** Although they paid off this episode, but you scare me sometimes.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:11]** You press go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:26]** And there is a... As Rick is watching him press go, and as soon as he hears the doors start to move, because I'm pretty sure it's loud, he triggers the signal jammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:28]** You trigger the signal jammer.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:35]** Before we tell, I mean, Kinko's going to know because the doors are open.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:38]** Yeah, you've already said that they are going to be open.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:39]** Okay.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** Going dark.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** You press the door.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:46]** Maybe... Bernice has got her pistol.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** Gun out?

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:47]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:57]** Maybe, very, very, very briefly, you feel the low frequency vibration of these doors coming up.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:00]** Terrible sound dampening in this...

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:27]** horrible it's not structurally isolated at all they don't care it's a f***ing lava planet I mean their hangar doors are huge yeah they're f***ing huge there's a moment nothing happens great let's leave and then Rick19 you think for a second that you like hear something from behind the door you think you hear like a cry like really coming from behind the training center

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:30]** And then over the comms and all of your ears is just this.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:33]** It's Koneka.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:40]** Okay, I am locked aboard the bridge of the Periton.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:45]** And I can see that Orvier and Dr. Get the f***.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** Get here right now.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:50]** I can see that Orphea and Dr. Nodens are in the Void Crier.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:54]** There is fighting happening in the ship right now.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** Some of the Peritons, I can see them.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:58]** I'm starting to fucking start the engines right now.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** And then you hear clicks and clacks.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:04]** And she's like, Peritons are currently fighting the stewards on the ship.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:07]** There are more stewards that are starting to run into the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** Okay, shields, shields.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** We need shields right f***ing now.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:11]** F***, f***, f***.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Wait, okay.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** No.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** F***, f***, f***.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** No.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** No.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** The Voight-Crier.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** F***.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** Where?

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:18]** Put on the f***ing shields.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:28]** They're pointing their weapons at the... And there's this massive rumble that occurs throughout the entire base and the line of communication.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** There goes our backup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:35]** Just goes dead.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:37]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:43]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:49]** Well, at least we know.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:53]** John kills another beloved NPC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:56]** So he doesn't have to die anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03
