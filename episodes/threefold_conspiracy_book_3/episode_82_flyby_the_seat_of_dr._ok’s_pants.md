## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:14]** Hello friends.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:22]** Welcome to my channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:23]** You have come to the right place at the right time.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:25]** Welcome to We'll Save.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:29]** We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:32]** I am your cloaked GM, John Swan.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** And I have a question.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** Where's your cloak?

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** I don't see your cloak.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:35]** Hang on.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:36]** Hang on.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:36]** I'm cloaked.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:37]** Hang on.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:37]** Hang on.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** Cut me out of the video.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** You can't, like, what?

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** Wipe me from the video.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:41]** Hey, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:44]** I'm an Oliver Jeffers painting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** Ooh, like an Oliver Jeffers painting.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** Dude, those are so rad.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** Look those up.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:56]** Benny, if you have been listening, I don't think that you listen to the show, Benny, because I've been putting in a different adjective every time.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** We'll say the podcast.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:57]** This is a show.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:58]** Yeah.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Why are you breaking the fourth wall, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:01]** Right?

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** Yeah.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** Look, question.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:11]** If you could take a class again, high school, elementary school, college, whatever, what would you take?

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** That's what I want to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:13]** I'll go first.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** Linear algebra.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** Wow.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:17]** Okay.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:17]** Alright.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:19]** And why is that?

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:23]** I would go back and I would retake it.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** I forget the professor's name.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:28]** I'd definitely look it up though at Pasadena City College.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:40]** But I took linear algebra with him the first semester and I bombed the first test and I was lazy because the homework was voluntary and I was like, I'm not going to do this shit.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** So I didn't do the homework.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** Sounds like night and

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:47]** I failed that test, and I was like, man, I dropped the class.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:50]** I was like, this is the first time I've ever failed a test.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** I'm not going to do it.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:57]** And I've never taken a linear algebra class that was anywhere compared to the level that he taught that.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** It was mind-boggling and amazing.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** He broke it down all the way back to the axioms.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** Like, what is the number one?

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** What are we talking about there?

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** And how do you get from one to two?

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:10]** And what is one plus one?

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:12]** And you had to actually break those down.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:15]** But the way he taught it was just phenomenal.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:37]** and you squandered it so i would go back but then you failed the test and you yeah apparently everybody failed it and i was just like i caught up in my head about it and i asked him and the professor even told me like oh don't worry about it and i was like no you don't think you understand man i have a 4.0 i can't i can't risk that and then i changed to a 3.3 student


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:58]** i like this redemption arc for you dude yeah i like this arc linear algebra when i retire yeah that sounds nice hopefully at his level yeah are you rolling some sort of device yeah i'm playing with what you're doing there kev i don't know you got okay um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:02]** This is not an advertisement for them, but Yarrow Studios makes flip die.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** And I just got mine.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:04]** It was a Kickstarter.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** And I got my flip die.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** These are the die.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** They are coins.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:12]** And there's a coin for, there's a D4 and a D10.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:15]** And they have little notches with ball bearings inside.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Ball bearing balls.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** Correction.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** Ball bearing balls.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:19]** Inside.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** And when you flip them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:25]** An important distinction for any mechanical engineering folk out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:28]** Well, on the box, they call them ball bearings, which is why I said that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** Which is wrong.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:35]** Kev, you only have 15 seconds left in your spot, so what else do you want to say before we cut it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** Yeah, they're not loud at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** Nope.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:41]** You flip them, and then you slam them down, and then you get a number like that.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:43]** I got a four on my D6.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** That's pretty good.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** That's like a pop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:47 - 00:05:04]** it is like it looks like a slammer intense slammer yep dude if you had that as a slammer you could like throw it slam it and then whatever it hits is your extra that you get to steal


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** Ooh, yeah.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** Yeah, they should add that in.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** Shout out to Pogs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:22]** My next-door neighbor, actually, he worked in some place that manufactured stuff, and so he actually cut these steel... I had a half-inch thick steel slammer.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** You were dirty.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:23]** Wow.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:24]** Yeah.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:26]** I want so many Pogs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** You want a third-party Pog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:33]** You got all my paper, cardboard, compressed things.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:36]** Anyways.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:37]** All right.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** Well, that's cool.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** What other classes do you guys want to talk about?

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** Nerds?

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** I'm still angry at Windows.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:49]** Well, I'll segue into that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** I would retake...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:54]** I would retake advanced computer science AP.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:59]** Not because I did bad or didn't learn anything.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** I was just an asshole back then.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:08]** And I could have gone further and farther if I had not been in such a prickly dude.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:20]** But yeah, I think I missed out on an opportunity to work on a laser interferometry project at JPL because of that.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:28]** So I would go back and I would kick all the same, but I would have a nice kinder attitude and not so cocksure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:32]** That's a good word.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:35]** Also, yet another kind of redemption arc, Ethan.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** You're like, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:40]** You literally asked a redemption arc question, John.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** It begs of redemption arc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** It begs of one.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:48]** Who would retake a class just to retake it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:48]** Yeah, I would.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** That was going to be my answer, but we'll get there.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:51]** It's fine.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** Did you enjoy it?

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** I did.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:57]** Are you talking about enjoyment classes?

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:27]** pottery I liked like yeah like I liked my geology class I also liked all my like like the theater class was really good my like senior uh high school senior theater time was just incredible theater class was fun I'll agree yeah film symposium at USC if you're a USC student it fills up quick in a public high school and it's all politics let me tell you boys hey man if you get cast in the play you get cast in the play you know what I'm saying


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:29]** No, it's whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:29]** In the musical?

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:30]** Yeah.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** Your classes are really fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** Yeah, they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:34]** They're full of the weirdest, fun people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:37]** I would probably go back.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** I'm torn between two classes.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:43]** One is a redemption arc.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** Audio recording techniques.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:51]** I rolled in and I was kind of a headstrong at the time.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:55]** And I had been working in production for a few years.

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:01]** Because I worked at this one non-profit for those few years, I knew everything there was to know.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:04]** And there wasn't anything this professor was going to teach me.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:26]** and so i had a really attitude and it was a saturday morning class and so i think i showed up to the first two who decided i wasn't gonna learn anything and never showed up to the rest of them in those two saturdays i did rewire the studio so they could track all 24 channels instead of just like four and your professor didn't do that so no he didn't he can yeah

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:46]** yeah dude it sounds like you were too good for that class man i think you're fine i certainly thought i was that's for sure um but no the class i would just go back to because i enjoyed it was combo um so yeah i played a lot of jazz in college and so like for a few hours every week it was just five guys in a room jamming good times

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:54]** And like, those were, those were such good times where it's just, it's, it's improv, but it's musical improv.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:56]** And so you've got a real loose framework and everybody's just grew.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** Yeah.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:02]** You, you, you got the professor there being like, Hey, that was good.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Or Hey, why don't you try this?

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:03]** And you're like,

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** yeah, that's cool.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** I didn't think of that either.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** Let's take it again.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Three, two, three, four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:10]** You know, it's like, yeah, you're working on it real time.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:10]** Indeed.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:11]** Such a good time.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:13]** I mean, most times the professor isn't even there.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** It's just the mindless cutting up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:15]** Oh, wow.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** He was hammering over.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:20]** Yeah, that or he was rewiring the studio.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** Right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:27]** I, you know, now that reminds me that I would probably go take, I didn't take this class.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:32]** And that's why I would go back is I would take a songwriting class at USC.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** I just thought that I was busy.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:38]** I thought that I should like focus on like instrument and jazz stuff.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:42]** And there were a few times where somebody was taking it and I would learn their song and play it with them.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** And I just wish that I had done that.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:46]** Cause over the course of, you know, what, what was it?

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:57]** 14, six, like however many weeks you write like a song every two weeks, man, that's just like, and then you play it in front of everybody and then they give you feedback.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:00]** It's like, that's like the best, best way to learn, man.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** So I would, I would do that again.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:11]** Kelly, would you take your basic computers class where you learn about Windows for the first time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:14]** When you had Windows 3.1.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** Really digging in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Yeah.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:27]** I'm still... I'm still negative about...

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:31]** the experience of trying to get Windows to work with all of our recording stuff on my end.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:34]** So I'm just going to throw negative things out.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:36]** In actual fact, I liked my programming classes.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:36]** They were really fun.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:39]** But I never took an actual computers class proper.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** But fuck Windows.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:46]** And then also, since I'm so negative, there was one time where I flirted.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** I'm sorry with those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:48]** I don't like you.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:51]** Thank you, Microsoft, for all the work you don't do.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** Yes.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:53]** And just bye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** I'm just such a mess.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:58]** I'm just saying, four of the five of us are on Macs, and we don't seem to have these problems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** I have a Mac.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** I could do it on the Mac.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** I guess I just need to do that from now on.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:07]** Yeah, because Kev always...

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:11]** Kev's not a Luddite, but he's just like, I just want to live 15 years in the past.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:15]** So then, like, I think that this computer is, like, the oldest.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** Man, this all runs really well on Snow Leopard.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:21]** I can run it down.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** Kev's not a Luddite, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:27]** He just likes to stay a little bit in the past.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** He stays one step behind.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:33]** He's like an Amish person that's just now getting a Model T Ford.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** And he's just like, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** Model T is one of my favorite cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** No, stop it.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:41]** Sure, but you don't drive it to work every day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:45]** I drove a 67 Mustang to work every day for about a year.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:48]** Dang it, hold on.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** I gotta redo my video.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:53]** Ah, Windows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:55 - 00:12:00]** Can I just say, in high school, I went to a magnet school for like a year.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:05]** And it was science and technology magnet.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:08]** And, uh...

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:10]** I was into computers, right?

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** A theme.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:19]** And so I signed up to take extra courses in computers as elective.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:27]** And it turns out, like, there's a required, like, minimum class that you have to take.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** Like, you know, like, your orientation.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:32]** Like, computer literacy is what they literally called it.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** They called it tech literacy.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** And they had another one called computer applications.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:39]** And they were the same class.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:43]** And I was so pissed.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** And they were like, well, you're stuck.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:46]** Like...

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** kidding me?

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** Such a waste.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:52]** You had to do the same project over and over again.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** Yep.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:55]** It was a slightly different order.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:57]** Some of the things were slightly tweaked.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:59]** But it was literally the same class.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:04]** Like, you learn Microsoft's suite of applications, and that's, like, technical literacy, I guess.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:05]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** Come on, guys.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:12]** I remember when, in Navy Nuke School, they were like, hey, next week we're going to be doing calculus.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:15]** And I've already taken calculus at this point, and I was like, yes, finally some real math.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:19]** And then we got into that class, and they were like, so you have this line.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:25]** We're going to draw boxes up to the line and shade those in and count the squares.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** And I was like, oh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** This is fake calculus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:34]** That's as far as we got because we didn't need to do anything higher than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** They weren't like, so here's an integral.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** Here's a derivative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:39]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** Wow.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:47]** My actual answer to the question is like, it's more of a revenge thing.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:49]** It's a theme.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:53]** I once took a different type of redemptive arc and

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:55]** Yeah, an interior design class.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Just hell of it.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** I thought it would be like really fun.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:01]** And I almost flirted with the idea of like doing that, doing that just to see.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** But like it was so boring and lame.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:12]** And then like the professor was like, cool, I want you to instead of doing anything awesome, I want you to go and like cut out a bunch of pictures of various like.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:16]** I don't even know styles of design, but she's like, it can't be from the internet.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:18]** And it has to be.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:18]** Yeah.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** But I, I wish I could do that.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:23]** But then she was like, no, you have to go and find magazines.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:27]** Like the only magazines I had and could find were like country.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:31]** You know, those like things that are like, Ooh, here's our like, you know, like country home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:34]** I can't only find magazines and cut them.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** What kind of crazy is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** It's so ridiculous.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:39]** Yeah, I couldn't.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:43]** And then I had like Dwell as like my modern example, but that was all I could do.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:45]** She wanted the most ridiculous, absurd things.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** I rage quit the next day.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:50]** And then I was just like, I wish I could just tell her that she shouldn't do it.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:52]** That's the only reason why I want to take that class again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** To tell her that and then quit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:55 - 00:15:19]** that's what i would say i it's it reminds me a whole lot of my um operating systems professor who like was a genius like tortured genius but a genius nonetheless and would make us write out code c++ code oh yeah with a pencil and paper that i mean on a test maybe

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** Was it, like, for homework?

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:25]** For assignments, for quizzes, for tests, for all that.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** Yeah.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:26]** Wow.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:29]** That could be... He did not.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:32]** Also, like, you knowing syntax does not make you a good programmer.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:33]** That's, like, really dumb.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:34]** It is.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:34]** In my opinion.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** You're so linter, everyone.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** Well, that's the thing.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:41]** If you're programming, use a linter and an IDE.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** Don't use notepad.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** You're not cool.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:48]** It's going to offer suggestions and autocomplete and color correction and all that stuff.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:53]** No, we're not programming anything in assembly here.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:54]** Please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:59]** Even if I was using assembly, I would still use an IDE.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:01]** I would never...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:29]** right why yeah legend has it and if some of the some of you uh people that have been around for a while longer know this uh that are listening or not i don't know but like in the old days you used to like have punch cards right and then you wait in a long long line and then you would hope that your code would compile like there was you had to get it right the first time or second time so you didn't go insane uh that's what they say this was this was the time this was the way but i


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:57]** I wanted to add John even those punch cards had like you couldn't just show up with your random punch card like you're not like you would you would literally like punch like a form out like that's how you wrote your code it wasn't like you handwriting code I forgot that Will was there bad handwriting I invented Fortran bro yeah come on dude Kelly what did you want to shout out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:00]** Well, I should have maybe waited for a natural lull, but here we go.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:19]** So I wanted to... What we like to do in the Discord is in the Rules and Mistakes channel, when you start to make contributions to the rules and let us know about our mistakes, of which there are many, we like to dub you a rules lawyer, a rules paralegal, excuse me, and give you that role and assign it to you.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** So today...

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:22]** Hercon or Hirsan, I don't know.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:28]** Your icon, I think we mentioned you before on the pod, but your icon is like a frog that's just like pointing into the abyss.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:28]** I really like it.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:33]** It's funny and it's exactly the kind of frog picture I would like.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:39]** But thank you for contributing to the Rules and Mistakes channel and talking about how we basically screwed up grenades.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** So here we go.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:47]** I officially dubbed the rules paralegal, which means that you'll get annoyed whenever we like ping the rules paralegals.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:49]** So here you go.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** Yeah, save...

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** Congratulations.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:56]** I'll officially let you know in the Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:05]** And if you or anybody you know likes to debate Starship or Starfinder rules or wants to contribute, jump in at discord.willsaythepodcast.com.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:05]** Is that the right URL?

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:08]** Even if you're not a rules paralegal.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:10]** Even if you're not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:30]** yeah if you want to up your chances of getting shouted out on the podcast being a rules paralegal is the right way to do it because uh we always mention like the other way i mean there's other ways but it's the best way yeah yeah that is one way there are other ways there might be even more ways because there's no nose but don't don't turn into a kevin where you're constantly constantly being like but actually like you know you got to like balance it out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:33]** Maybe if you just follow the rules, Kelly.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:33]** All right.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:38]** So, let's get into a recap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** Can I ask one question first?

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** My finger is twitching.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** I'm so sorry, John.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** So, like...

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:47]** I've got about one glass left in the bottle.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:53]** And I don't want to dirty a glass, but I also feel weird drinking scotch right out of the bottle.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** Do it.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:55]** Is that?

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:59]** As long as you sniff it and then swirl it.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** Sniff, swirl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Okay, cool.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:01]** Done.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:03]** Colin, that's what we do with space rum.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:09]** You know, just down it right out of the bottle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** Cheers.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** Cheers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:14]** To rules.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** To rules and beverages.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** Kev is the only one who's like, to rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** I like rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** To the letter of the law.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:31]** Let's jump in.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:41]** You four and Kaniko Breeze are at the helm of the Stewards Banshee Special Ops Edition starship.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:45]** On the eve of battle.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:47]** By eve, I mean you had a moment.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** There's a pause.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:57]** Because after nearly all of Pike's paratons, not the stewards, have attacked you...

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:08]** due to mental conditioning from the greys, you have made your way to the bridge to take on... Take it to the bridge.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** Take it to the bridge, everybody.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:20]** Take on this grey ship that's holding you in place due to the drift shadow projector.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** Question, why are they still here?

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** What could they be thinking?

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:30]** Why did they twist the minds of your shipmates to plot against you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Because they were never there.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** They're robots.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:33]** This is a ruse.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** This all is a simulation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:38]** Oh, like the greys are not even real?

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:40]** So there's something behind even the greys, potentially?

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** Yes.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** These thoughts!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:44]** And more!

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** Well, the greys are just a second fold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:51]** Must be racing through each of your minds.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:53]** What if we're still in the first fold?

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** We could still be on the first fold.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** We're like on the verge of the second fold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:01]** I can sense this nervous energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** We really don't know where we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** You know why we're nervous?

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:07]** Because we're about to do Starship Combat.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:13]** I can only speak for myself, but I don't know what I'm doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:16]** It's going to be a good time.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** We tried.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:22]** I've done it before, but I feel like the pressure is now a little bit heightened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** You know what the pressure is?

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:29]** The pressure is to just have a good time and be the awesome players that you guys are.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:56]** forward so as we get back into it oh shit let's recall that dr okay but let's recall that dr okay uh piloted the ship to turn around that was the start of star ship combat as dr okay pull the ue as they say in the business i'm not trying to in order to

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:09]** get one on this vehicle which again or the starship which we know was in the aft portion of the ship before dr okay moved it and it was showing up on scans but you can't see anything there

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:14]** So, as we enter in, in Foundry, Dr. O.K.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** is our pilot.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:18]** Colin Edenbrand is one of our gunners.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** Hears is a science officer.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:23]** Rick19 is the second gunner at this first round.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** And Kaniko Breeze.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** I would say that I'm the primary gunner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:29]** I mean, he does shoot the most.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:32]** Are you on the turret or are you on the switching around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:34]** I'm on the gunner's council.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** The gunner's council.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** Yeah, the council and council.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** The council.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:43]** I am the council again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** Keniko is our captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:48]** Kevin's like, oh, yeah.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** What did we call captain?

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** Did we call captain something else?

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** The morale officer.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Morale officer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** Confidence officer.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** So here's the thing.

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:06]** I'm going to let you all not only control Kaniko, like decide what she does, you will also role play as Kaniko.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:12]** I think it just makes sense to have that all on your side of the chessboard here.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** So, who wants to do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:14]** To do what?

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:19]** To roleplay as Kaniko.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:20]** K-A-N-I-K-O.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:25]** Do we get her character sheet to reference?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:31]** So, I did put up her stats in our internal server.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** I will copy them again.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:35]** Me copy this again.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:38]** And I will put it into our chat here on...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** Video client?

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** Unnamed video client.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:45]** Unnamed video client.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:49]** Yeah, it didn't do that, so I'm just going to resend it because it won't go.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** So I'm going to resend it in Starfinder.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:54]** You can see her stuff, which should be relevant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:56]** Just make sure you send it to his hotmail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:03]** Also, thank you, Foundry, for adding in a cool... He'll get it whenever he connects to the dial-up.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:16]** So, Earth, thank you, Foundry, for allowing this cool thing in Foundry where you can add in your crew members to roles in your starship when you designate a token as starship.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** It's really, really neat.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:18]** Really cool.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:19]** Really cool.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:19]** Really cool.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** Yes.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** Yes.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:21]** Yes.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** All right.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** Any questions before we begin?

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:31]** Don't forget that you've got this green orb in your corner that allows you to turn on and off the firing arc.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:37]** Right now, the Voidcrier has moved, I think, roughly eight or ten hexes back and done a Yui.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** As we said, facing the opposite direction.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:42]** The forward arc is to the right.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** Tensions, are they high on the ship?

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:46]** What's going on?

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** Yes, absolutely.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** Absolutely.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** Okay.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:50]** Okay.

**[00:24:51 - 00:25:00]** I'm going to add you guys into the combat encounter here, and we are going to begin Starship Combat.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:08]** All right.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:15]** First things first, we're going to start with everybody's in their roles, where they're going to be, right?

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** First round starts.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:25]** Who wants to go in the engineering phase of round one?

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:28]** What is... There's no one in the engineer seat.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:33]** So is there any... Question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:38]** Can I act in the, like, as magic officer and gunner?

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** I think I have to choose one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:41]** You have to choose for this round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** Okay.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** Yep.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:45]** You're supposed to choose at the top of the round, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:45]** Top of the round.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:46]** Cool.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:51]** I'm actually going to slide into the magic officer role.

**[00:25:53 - 00:26:05]** And I'm going to look... Colin's going to look very closely at the coolant tubes and how the bubbles are rising and falling and divinate from how those are moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** Departure from nuclear boiling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:09]** Yes, that.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** Thank you, Kevin.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** Whatever those words are.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** Was that a subway thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** I mean, a submarine thing.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** Is that a subway thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** No, it's definitely a subway thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** It's actually more of a heat exchanger.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:29]** That's how they make the sandwiches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:55]** that's how they make the sandwiches out of rubber all right so sorry so uh you might be able to drag yourself in the void crier if you want to switch over in crew but you are now sorry you went into the magic offers magic officers role yes i'm trying to figure out how do i get to the void crier oh there we go crew bingo bingo so i can drag me from gunners to magic magic officer dope


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:55 - 00:27:20]** cool and i'm going to use scrying to basically scan for the gray starship what is scrying is that scream yeah is that tell me more about that scrying is is divination so sort of what i described him watching the bubbles and the particulates and the in the holiday who be what he's going up and down is how he's gonna use a crooked stick and a rod

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** Yeah, basically.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:36]** To figure out, according to what Sarenrae might bestow, what wisdom Sarenrae might bestow upon him, to figure out something about our ward.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:42]** I'm trying to figure something out about this ship that's got us stalled.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:43]** So here we go.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:49]** I get to use my mysticism instead of engineering because he's a mystic and he's got lots of mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:57]** Well, fun fact, scry actually means to foretell the future using a crystal ball or reflective object or surface.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** Awesome.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:58]** It's a real word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:04]** IRL, in real life, people will paint a mirror black and then kind of look into it.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** It's like a dull reflection.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** It's supposed to freak you out.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** It's kind of cool.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:10]** Question.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** Yes, sir.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** No, no, no.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:13]** Sorry.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** Kind of retract that question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** What did you roll?

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:20]** I rolled a 10 plus my mysticism, which is 15.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** So 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:31]** And the DC is five plus one and a half times the tier of the starship being scanned, which we do not know yet.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:32]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** So you don't know what's going on with that.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** And you find out the information.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:37]** Yeah.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:38]** Good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** Yeah, basically, plus it's bonus.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:46]** If I succeed, I learn the first unknown piece on the following list.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:51]** For every five with which I exceed, I learn another unknown piece of information.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:53]** This is cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** You succeeded.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** Thank you.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:02]** I like this a lot.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:04]** I am going to go look and see what that list is.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:09]** I believe it's the same as scam, right?

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** So.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** I'm nodding because my mouth is full.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:15]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Got it.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:17]** Got it.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** So you got a 25, right?

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:21]** Yes.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:23]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** That's dope.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** As the kids would say, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:32]** And on this list, on page 325 in the Core Rulebook, there are five.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:35]** There's basic information, defenses, weapon, load, and other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:40]** I can't help but notice there's a glaring omission in this list.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:41]** Of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:42]** Location.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:45]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:50]** Do you want to know the location?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:53]** And I think the assumption is that you've already spotted.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:59]** I would like to... I don't know if John could be convinced to add that to the list.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:01]** But... Maybe.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** I'm going to make the pitch.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** I feel like location should be zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** So...

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** I'm going to let you choose.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:15]** You can either, because you succeeded so well, you technically get more than just the one.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:19]** There's something about the connection that you have.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:31]** It feels a little too easy for you to just feel like you are, again, you are abducted, but then also we don't know why you were in those bushes on Outpost Omicron.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** We don't know what happened before.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:41]** And there's something about this that you tap in and you're like, I can feel the presence of them.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** So I'm going to let you decide.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:51]** You can either try and extend it and learn as the letter of the law, learn more than one, or you can know about their location.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** Because you did really well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:55 - 00:31:04]** So what you're saying is I can either get the location of the ship exactly, presumably, like know which hex the ship is in.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:05]** Right.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:10]** Or I can get any number of these items, but I don't know how many.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:11]** No, you know.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:15]** I mean, I'll tell you, you could get one and two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Yeah, screw that.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** Give me the location.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:44]** okay i want to know exactly actually you get one two and three because you succeeded twice bargain you learn another unknown piece of information which by the way location or the location yeah that is this is a lot of information i like that seems crazy that you just give all of this right away but i mean that's the book

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:48]** Is scrying different than scan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:48]** No.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:58]** The magic officer is like you, the way it's written, it's like you scan, but with your mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:58]** All right.

**[00:31:59 - 00:31:59]** Location.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:01]** I'm still recording.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** I'll take location.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** Final answer.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:07]** They are one hex away.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** I don't believe it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:10]** Really?

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:15]** In your starboard firing arc.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:18]** As of right now, the start of this combat.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:18]** Wow.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:20]** But you can't see them.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** You cannot see them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:25]** You're not going to believe this.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:27]** We're right on top of them?

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:33]** The bubbles are saying that the gray ship that we're looking for is...

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:39]** If you look out the starboard window, you should be able to see them, but they're not there.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:41]** But they are there, but they're not there.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:43]** And you can't see them, but they're there.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:43]** I promise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:47]** I'm not picking them up on my weapons scan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** I'm going to throw them.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:53]** I'll put a little circle on your map so you know where to aim.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:56]** So we can hit them with that information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:01]** We can't hit them with that information, I think, based on my years of experience.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** Mr. GM dude?

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** So technically, you cannot.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:14]** But given your success with the scrying and knowing where it is, I think you would, but you would get a minus because it's not going to show up on your targeting computer.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** So you're going to have to use the force.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:17]** That's it.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:22]** If I do another scan, can I help further narrow down?

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:23]** No, it's not.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** No.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** Got it.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** Well, great.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** You know the hex that they are in.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** That does not necessarily.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:30]** Well, one, I mean, we're just in the engineering phase.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:32]** We're not even in the pilot phase.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** So let's see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** Oh, because they can move.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** And we don't know where we are in initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:43]** We don't have breaching pods, do we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** Do we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:45]** We do not have breaching pods.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** No.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:50]** Okay, is there anything else we're going to do on the engineering phase?

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:52]** I don't think so.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** I can do some stuff, right?

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** I mean, I think we all have turns.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** Is that right?

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Well, depending on our role.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:58]** You can act in it.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** You can act.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:05]** Last episode, I helped narrow, I helped, I buffed Kevin's weapon, basically.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:09]** With, I believe it was ready weapon system.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:13]** There's another one called range finding, which basically does the same thing.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:40]** oh no it's a bonus to one attack roll or skill check uh i'd like to do that too because there's nothing really in engineering proper that i can do that's interesting okay yeah what i intend to do one of damage because um the other one helps you plus one to attack yeah all right so uh here's never left and he's just he was just under colin's like gun the entire time like doing his mechanical computer stuff he's just like i have one more thing to give you rick let me see here bloop bloop

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:45]** And then he's like, all right, so this will make it easier for you to hit.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:50]** I mean, with that new information that we found that they're kind of invisible, this might be helpful for you.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:51]** All right.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:55]** It gives you a pat on the back and like looks over your shoulder.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** I'm ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** You got this.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** Okay.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** He puts his hand up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** That's the engineering phase.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:03]** Let's do some piling rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:07]** I love you too, Rick.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** You're a good friend, though.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** I love you.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Love you, buddy.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:16]** I don't... Anyway, let's move on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:19]** All righty.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:28]** Dr. OK, what did you get on your piling roll?

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** Let me... Remember that you get a plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:33]** Yes, of course.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** My gosh.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:38]** Why can't I find my sheet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:58]** here we go uh piloting oh this is dr okay talking to himself i can pilot this with a 24 wow okay oh good good move 24 okay they got higher than you of course they did very well

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:02]** I will say they did very well.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:05]** But they got higher than you for this turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** So they're going to move first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:09]** You move first.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** Oh, we move first?

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** Okay.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** Yeah, the lower roll moves first.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:26]** Given our situation, we either try to ram them or we try to keep them at arm's length in front of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** What say you all?

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:34]** I just buffed Rick up pretty well, and I feel like he's not going to do what he did with the supercharged weapon.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:37]** I think he's going to use it, so whatever allows him to actually shoot would be good.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:44]** If he can get right up next to him and still shoot, I'm fine with that because I'm pretty experienced with boarding, if that's something you wanted to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:50]** We don't have any breaching pods, but ramming we could do.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** I just realized.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** That's true.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:53]** Question for John.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** I know where they are.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** Do I know what way they're facing?

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:58]** No.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** Okay.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:03]** We know where they are, but we don't know where they're going.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** What are you going to do?

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:07]** This is a bit of a pickle.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** I think we try to get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:10]** This is a pickle?

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** What do you mean, out of here?

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** Like, run away?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:25]** I mean, the shadow projector has a range of about six axes, and so if we can get outside of that, we could jump back into the drift, get to where we're going.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** You're already in the drift.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Just saying, run out?

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:33]** Without knowing what they're facing, I think that's not a run they play.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:43]** Is it possible that if we were outside of this shroud that you were referring to, that we would be able to see them on targeting systems?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:44]** Potentially.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:45]** I don't know.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:48]** Is there something I can roll to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** Give me an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** Uh, I... No.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** Can I... I can't roll engineering on train.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** Kev, yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** You do that, I'll help.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** I'll do engineering, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** We'll all help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** You are all hearing this conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:08]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:11]** I mean, engineering, what'd you get?

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** A 33.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Very nice.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** I assist with a 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:21]** Is that two natural 20s?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** Wow.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:26]** But it's only a 24 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** It's still very impressive.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** You know that they are cloaked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:34]** My first roll on my flip die was a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** Definitely worth the money.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:36]** Omens.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** They are cloaked.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:44]** Getting outside of a range would not change the fact that they will be seen or not.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:50]** Getting outside will allow you to actually start to move through the drift in any sort of meaningful fashion.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:54]** You will actually be able to get back on the way that you need to go.

**[00:38:54 - 00:39:01]** So if you wanted to get out of 10 hexes and just book it, you can book it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** So when you were talking about being cloaked in the opening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** In real life, that would be the wise thing to do.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:10]** But from a podcast perspective, I feel like you should probably try to actually do this justice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** I don't know, man.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** You can do whatever you want, man.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:15]** Do it from whatever perspective.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:18]** They did abduct you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** Shoot him out of the sky.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:22]** I'm still mad what happened to Nico and everyone else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** Okay, what is the pilot doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:36]** The pilot's going to try... I'm just going to move my full speed, try to get us in position to get them in our sights, maybe.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** But here's the thing.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:46]** We won't know where they are after they've moved, so we have to do another scan, like a scry, to locate them, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:50]** I'll tell you that with your super successes... Again, this is because you guys are killing it today.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** With your super success...

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:59]** You venture that once they start firing, they will be uncloaked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Oh, okay.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:04]** So it's sort of like the invisibility spell.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** It's like Klingon cloaking.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** That's a good comparison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:13]** In the first four iterations of the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:15]** Cool.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Okay.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:23]** So maybe then what I will do is... Broadside them.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** I mean, can we?

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:30]** Can we ram them?

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:34]** If you can rotate in place, I could shoot them in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Yeah, it's a gunner.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:38]** It's level 6, so you can't do it.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** I just don't know if you can rotate in place.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** You don't have to move.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:45]** To rotate, I think you can just do whatever you want.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:49]** You don't need to roll, I believe.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:53]** You're going to just rotate.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** But that counts as one move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:59]** I feel like that goes into maneuverability of the craft.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:01]** You have to move forward in order to rotate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:08]** No, I'm fairly certain that I just read that if you're just going to turn...

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:11]** If you just turn without doing anything, it's fine.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** I could be wrong.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** No.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** That's not right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** Turn without moving.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** No movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Yeah.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** There's rules for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:24]** There's rules for it, but I'm saying that it's... Yeah, you lose AC and TL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** Yeah, I'm not doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** Is that a stunt?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** Trying to bait me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** Yeah, it's a stunt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:33]** Trying to bait me, GM, who doesn't exist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:35]** That's a stunt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** It's just there, the void.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** That's where it is.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:38]** No movement.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:40]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** Okay, what is your maneuverability?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** I thought it was moderate.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** What does it say on the handout?

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:47]** I'm looking.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** Good.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:50]** One turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:55]** You would not take any AC or TL changes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:58]** If you have poor maneuverability, then you lose AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** That's why I was saying.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:03]** So it wouldn't harm you to just turn.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:07]** You can just face any direction and stay in the same hex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** I'm going to move one hex.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** No, I'm just going to rotate.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** I'm just going to rotate in place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:17]** Just a reminder, we do not have any weapons on the aft section of the ship.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:21]** We do have the turret, however.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:25]** You have a heavy net on the front, on the forward, right?

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:28]** Light particle beams on the starboard and port.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:33]** Do I need to do a skill check for rotate, turn, and place?


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:34]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** We have a heavy laser cannon in the front.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:41]** We have light particle beams on each side.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:45]** And then we have the heavy laser net on the turret.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:49]** OK, no, you don't need to do anything, I think, to turn in place.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:52]** I'm not seeing a DC to stunt.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** So is that what you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:59]** Putting that hex in the.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** Because he's got a movement still, right?

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:07]** And presume he's seen us move ahead of this, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:10]** Yeah, that's what started Starship Combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:20]** I think it's wise to try and get a little distance so we increase the amount of real estate our forward firing arc will have.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:26]** So I'm going to rotate.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:31]** I'm going to travel 10 hexes and rotate to face them like this.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** A couple of hexes away.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:37]** A couple of hexes away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:39]** Couple hexes away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** And yet you're still so far away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** All right, so you are now three hexes away.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:47]** You've done a U-turn.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** But I can't.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:57]** I like this idea that you flew in and came into this square and Colin was like...

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:22]** oh they're right here we did really well and and you're like i got this after thinking about it you're like let's line them up dead in the sights dr okay pulls the handbrake and just like rick can you uh you know where they are roughly he's still he's still above your shoulder he's whispering into your ear hey rick yes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:45]** you know where they are roughly you're gonna shoot them or do you need uh yeah i mean they they are moving i have no idea where they're going to they're close all right yeah i i thought that yeah that's right okay all right cool rick good call good call well when you know where they are give them hell all righty so they move


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** It is now.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** Why does it reset initiative?

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** Question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:58]** If we would have done a flyby, how does that work if we lose the initiative?

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:58]** Wait, what?

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:08]** So a flyby, you fly through their hex, and then you're able to take an attack at close range from any arc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:08]** Right.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:13]** And they would have been able to take an attack on you, I think, because you moved...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:36]** that's if you fail if you fail your structure moves as described but you follow normal rules and the mode yeah yeah so if you had wanted to try and go under that and do a flyby and do an attack you could have done it as long as you meet the dc uh that might have been right path because then we would have at least gotten to target them without knowing where they were i don't think we would have been able to though because we didn't have the maneuverability


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** based on where we were facing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:46]** Ship moves as normal, so he could have done a U-turn and then flown through that hex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:50]** It's not a, you can't do a U-turn and then fly through.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** It's a move and then U-turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** Right.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:58]** He would have to do like, he'd have to move and turn, move and turn until he made a U-shape and then come back through the hex.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Oh yeah, I guess.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:02]** And you could probably do that in 10 seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** Cool.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:11]** So you spin around, you spin around and I believe we do the gunnery check in the order that the piloting check was.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:13]** So what are you all going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** Wait, where'd you move to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:26]** I'm just going to call in some pirate friends and they'll just help out.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:27]** Maybe.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** Need some other ships here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** I don't exactly know what to do here.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** What is Rick19 saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** Yeah, what does Rick say?

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:43]** I am just going to target where I believe they are going.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** That's the best I can do at this point.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:48]** And he's going to just lock on to empty space.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** That's a 17 on my flip die.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** Don't forget you have a plus one or whatever.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** Plus one plus my nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** You don't have a plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:01]** No, I got one from... Sorry, sorry, sorry.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:02]** My bad.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** So that is a 27 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:08]** Okay, and where did you fire on Foundry?

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** What gun and what arc?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** What do you fire on?

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:18]** I'm going to say I fired on the... What's the yellow one?

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** Port side.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:25]** So that would be my light particle beam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:27]** Light particle beam.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** Light particle beam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:32]** Targeting the port side with light particle beam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** flies out.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:37]** Enhance.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:38]** Enhance.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:43]** This sweet light laser, white laser, just shoots off.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:48]** Let's see what happens when they attack.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:52]** What is your AC, before we cry?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** It's 18.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:58]** Can we have Canico buff us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:02]** You are controlling Kaniko, so yeah, you can do that.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:05]** Before we do, I guess it's too late now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:10]** I was going to say, I think we could have done that in the engineering phase, but not in the gunnery phase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** Yeah.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:12]** Okay.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** All right.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** Missed opportunity.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:16]** It's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:18]** That's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** Okay.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:25]** You fire off into the port.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:27]** Off into the port arc.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** And you hit.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:36]** That white laser shoots through space and just keeps going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** I don't appear to have hit anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:44]** And then a white laser comes in from your starboard.

**[00:48:46 - 00:49:11]** arc as the gray capsule right next to where materializes actually dealing 12 points of damage to the void crier yikes the port side shields to the starboard shields starboard shields yeah they're on the starboard side yeah i can see them on my targeting scans now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** Okay.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:19]** How do we apply the... Well, it's probably a bad time to... Oh, wait, here it is.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:22]** And there was 12 points, you said?

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** 12 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:26]** Does that meet a critical threshold?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** What is the critical threshold?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:34]** It's your CT on the 13th.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** CT is 13th.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:38]** No, that would be 13.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** It was only 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:39]** 13.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:40]** Ooh, okay.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:49]** So your systems are intact, but you get rocked on the starboard shields with 12 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:49]** Yeah.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:54]** Since I rolled so high, if I would have said starboard, would you at least give me a hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:59]** I think to shoot, you have to know the hex that they're going to be in.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** Are they facing forward?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:05]** I don't know if it says that in the rules, but I'm just curious.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:08]** I mean, I hold pretty damn good.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** It's a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** So wait, it's not start forward?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** No, it was a 17.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** I forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** It is forward.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:21]** I have my alternative rotation not set to the front arc because I had to do something special to get yours set.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Do you see my color rays now?

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:23]** Yes.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:25]** My firing arc?

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** Yeah, cool.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:29]** So I had to do something special to get yours to face forward.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:31]** I just was lazy and didn't do that for mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:33]** I thought that you couldn't target a corner.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:40]** And your center line for your forward firing arc is a corner of a hex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:41]** Right.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:44]** What you do is you decide which arc it's in.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:48]** So if you are on a corner, you decide which arc it's in.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** You are in the purple forward arc.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:50]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:58]** No, I mean, if you look right now... You're saying that your arc isn't aligned on a hex, is what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:04]** Right, so just to agree, the left corner of their ship is what we are calling the front, which is what... That's fine.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** That's what I was calling the front.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:08]** I'm just looking at the pink ship.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:12]** Yeah, so you are in that...

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:15]** is it just a UFO?

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:42]** like a classic UFO it's a classic UFO it looks like it's on the cover of an X-Files it is a circular gray disc that materializes out of space with a black dome at the top and there are like light blue lights that are running around the ship around the black dome and around the saucer side of the ship a gray saucer capsule has materialized in front of you

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:45]** And hit you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** Oh, she is.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:49]** Kaniko, can you do it?

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** There she is.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** Can you shoot him?

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** Is Kaniko free to shoot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Who is playing Kaniko?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:56 - 00:52:00]** Not I. She would have had to declare prior to the round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:02]** And she was a gunner, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:04]** Yep.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** I can't do it now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** But maybe I will later.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:09]** Why?

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** There it is.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:12]** Will is playing Koneko.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:13]** I like it.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** I like it.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:16]** Okay.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** All right.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** That's the end of round one.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Round two.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:20]** You all changing any roles?

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** What's happening here?

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** This is your time to swap roles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** If you can get us within five hexes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** I'm going to try and get us in.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** I'll try my best.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** Uh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** Is somebody going to take the turret, or shall I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:38]** It's been a while since I've driven stick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** It should be you, Rick.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** Let's be real.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** It should be you.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:47]** I can help buff your weapon again, and hopefully this time we can actually... Actually, I think this should be me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** This being a magic weapon and all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** Alright, fair enough.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** I'm with you.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** I don't know what that means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** I'll explain it later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:59]** Can you do something this round?

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:04]** Not just stand on your... Stand around looking like nothing's happening.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** This ship's about to fall apart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** Rick, can you take the other gun?

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** I will man the gunner's station.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:17]** And then Colin's doing the magic net, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:17]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** On the turret, yeah.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** All right, awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:27]** Yeah, so it's a weapon with a mystic property, meaning I get to use my mysticism modifier instead of, like, anything else.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** Yeah, makes sense.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Which is silly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:38]** Am I correct that Kaniko's diplomacy is plus 15 modifier?

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** You are correct, sir.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** F***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:42]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** Maybe she could just get us out of this by talking to them.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** Sounds like she's the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** I mean, morale officer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** Morale officer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Morale officer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:56]** Can you give us some morale?

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:58]** Could you maybe offer some?

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:00]** Yes, I will give you morale.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** If you just hang on a moment.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** That was pretty good, Kanika.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:09]** Kanika, maybe have a word with Dr. O.K.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:15]** to get us a little better in position to maybe disable this gray sheep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:22]** Because I could have done that last turn not knowing where they were, but okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** But you didn't know where they were?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** And also, I moved last.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:27]** Not an indictment on Dr.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:30]** O.K., but improving our initiative is going to put us in position.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:38]** Yes, I get that we need to get... Like I said, it's been a while since I've driven a stick, okay?

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:43]** I think you're doing a great job, Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:47]** Only if I could just get the rotation, I would have piloted it better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:54]** If this were a slot car, it would be going much better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:58]** Wasn't Melted Man completely useless during our last combat?

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** He didn't do anything.

**[00:54:59 - 00:54:59]** 100% useless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:04]** I feel like you're editorializing the combat because you couldn't talk to them and get them to quite do what you wanted.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:08]** So, no, I think they were very helpful if you wanted them to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** I have a, I have a question.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** So, so the, the grays have revealed themselves.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:15]** So now are they going to cloak again before they fire again?

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** Is there a timeout for this?

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** That kind of thing?

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** Or, uh, all right.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:18]** We don't know.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:19]** All right.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:22]** If that's the case, like, uh, Colin, you think you're going to be able to hit on this round?

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:25]** You're going to try to, yeah.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:25]** All right, cool.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** Colin, I'm going to buff your gun.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:27]** All right.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:29]** Welcome to the gunners like pod, which I never leave.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:33]** So, uh, all right, cool.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:34]** We lost the, okay.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:35]** Yeah.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:40]** So, uh, there, you got a plus one to, uh, to, uh, to, you know, damage.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:41]** All right.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:41]** Nice.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** So enjoy.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:42]** All right.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Which, which thing is that?

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:47]** Oh, wait, what tier is the starship that we're fighting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:49]** You don't know yet.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** You have to scan or scry again.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** Also, what action did you take?

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** It's called Ready Weapon System.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** Ready Weapon System.

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:59]** It's an open action.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** Okay, cool.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:03]** Science things aren't really helpful right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:20]** love it yeah yeah it's fine cool uh so just just so you know john if they're a tier if they're greater than tier five it's a plus two instead of a plus one so sounds good it's a plus one all right well that's good probably so

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:24]** All right, so you are in the roles that you want to be in.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:27]** Pretty much the same, just you're saying which weapons you're at.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:30]** It is the engineering phase of round two.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** What are you doing while I do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:36]** Doesn't the captain's phase go for... Captain can go anytime.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:40]** It's engineering, piloting, go.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** Okay, well...

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:45]** Um, I'm going to, you guys can do it this round.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:51]** And she's going to roll for, uh, to encourage nice on a diplomacy.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:54]** And, uh, that's at any time.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:54]** Right.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** And that's for the whole round.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:59]** Or is it one crew member?

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** Crew member gains two.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:01]** Is it one crew member?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** Yeah, it's one crew member.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** It's one crew member.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** Targeted crew member for the whole round.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** For their action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:09]** And we're doing engineering to stabilize the shields?

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** Is that correct?

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:10]** I don't think so.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:11]** This round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:16]** I don't think anyone has done anything to stabilize the shields this round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:16]** No.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:16]** Hello.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** Hi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:20]** Crew, who needs help?

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:23]** I thought that you were going to bump Dr. Okay.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** Yeah, sure, I'll do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** I'm just saying what I remember you guys talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** That's just like the single most important thing.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:31]** I don't remember that, but that's fine.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** Ooh, yeah.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:36]** So you already have a plus 15, so you're automatically going to give it.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:41]** You're just rolling to see if you get a success, a natural 20, which would increase the bonus.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** And I got a one.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:46]** Wow, you got a one.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** I mean... But it's a 16.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:52]** Yeah, I don't think that that is the...

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:55]** You're encouraging.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** I don't think that natural one for there would count.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** What would that even be like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:02]** You just say something accidentally, incredibly insulting and discouraging.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** Yeah, what did she say?

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** What did she say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** To Dr. O'Kane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:09]** Why don't we let Dr. O'Kane decide?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:13]** You've probably been doing this so long that you're just an expert.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:15]** Don't sweat it, okay?

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** Well...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** Thanks.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:21]** Does Dr. K feel better with that or feel worse?

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:25]** Because that would tell you whether we fail or whether you actually fail or succeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Well...

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:30]** Thank you for your vote of confidence, Kaniko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:34]** Awesome.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** All right.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** So plus two.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:40]** I'm assuming Dr. K was cool with that weird compliment.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:40]** Yes.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** Okay.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** All right.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:43]** Okay.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** I like it.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:44]** Okay.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:48]** So Dr. K has a plus two from Kaniko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** Sorry, I didn't mean to interject on the engineering.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:53]** I thought we were going to buff engineering, but I don't know why I thought that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** Because we do need to do that at some point.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:56]** Yes.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:58]** We only have three on the starboard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:01]** It is possibly an important thing.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** Anything in engineering?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** The problem with that is Dr. OK would be the one to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:11]** You can always glide and change roles.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:12]** All right.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:15]** So anything else in the engineering phase?

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:16]** No.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** Solid.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** Piloting check.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** Let's go, Dr. OK.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** All right.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:21]** Here we go.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** Let's see what happens.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** Let's do this.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:27]** Here we go.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** I'm going to do this.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:33]** And it's a plus two, right?

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:37]** You get a plus two to your roll and you will already have a plus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** Yeah.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:39]** Yeah.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:39]** 19.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** Apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:41]** Okay.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** 19.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** All right.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:49]** They did better than you, but not by much.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** They got 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:53 - 01:00:01]** So I'm going to put our starboard side to him just in case we get hit again.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** As best I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:08]** If we could put our forward side up, I could use this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:11]** I'm going to do another Dr. Okay.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** Okada's tube maneuver.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:17]** Did you hear Colin just now, though?

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** What?

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:19]** No, I didn't.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** He had a suggestion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** Yes, Colin.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:27]** If you put that forward side to them, I can try to target them with this net.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:29]** I don't see your thing move on mumble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:31]** May I suggest we do a flyby?

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:33]** That will at least give us an attempt to target them.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** Can you guys hear Vinny?

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:35]** Before they move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:38]** Colin, what was that?

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:40]** I couldn't quite hear you down there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:43]** The bowels of the ship.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:48]** If we could see the front of the ship over...

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:57]** If we could point the ship to the forward arc to show where they're going to be, I could use this net to do some real, real damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:03]** Yeah, well, that's up to John to show the forward arc.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:06]** But it might be... But he can turn...

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** Oh, wait, this turret.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:08]** He's starting there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:09]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** The turret can go anywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:11]** Yeah.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** Sorry.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:14]** In my head, this turret was in the forward arc only.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:18]** But no, we just need to be within five hexes period.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** Okay.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** Yeah.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:20]** Sorry.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:20]** Okay.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:22]** Rewind.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:28]** Doctor, if you could put us within five hexes of where they stop, I could probably do some damage with this here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:35]** It's going to be hard to do if I'm moving last, but I'll do my best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:38]** Is it possible to fly by them?

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** And maybe we can target them on the way.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** That's a smart idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:45]** Uh, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** You want me to try that?

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:51]** It's been a while since, uh, it's a calculated risk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:56]** Let's just say, um, I trust your calculations.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** I'm for it.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** But man, I'm really bad at math.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:07]** Can he goes like, what?

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:09]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:36]** okay so uh piloting check to move starship up to its speed and move through one enemy occupied hex without provoking yeah yeah i think that's what you're trying to do yeah and it's contingent on the fact that check yeah but it's it's sort of like they can evade it right because they still move in their piloting phase i think if you succeed you get to take the take the attack


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:42]** Yeah, because I think the point is that it allows you to move and attack in close.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:43]** Yeah.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:47]** If you fail, you provoke an attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:50]** I have just enough movement to get through.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:54]** So do I move no matter what, or what happens if I fail?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** You still move.

**[01:02:56 - 01:03:00]** If you fail, you do your move as normal, but you take an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:01]** Got it.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:01]** Okay.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:02]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:06]** We're going to have him on our backside after this is all done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:09]** And Dr. O.K.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:10]** is going to move.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** He's going to do a little bit of a lilt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** Call it Ocotus 3.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:19]** Just going to zigzag towards him.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:20]** Right by him.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:21]** We're real close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:23]** Right by him.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** And you have to roll.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Piloting, right?

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** Yeah.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:28]** Do I still get two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:31]** 15 plus one and a half times the enemy ship tier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:33]** No, your ship tier.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:35]** If you use the starship.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:36]** The enemy ship.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** I'm looking at it on your thing.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:40]** It says plus ST.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:40]** It's a 17, right?

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:44]** 15 plus 1.5 ST, which is ship tier.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:45]** Ship tier.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:48]** Which is using the handy-dandy Starship DC table.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:50]** It's a 22 on my piloting check.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:50]** It's a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:53]** That's what I have to get for this to pay off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:54]** Yes.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** Is that our ship tier?

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:58]** Because according to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:01]** It says ship tier on the handout.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:02]** EST is enemy ship tier.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:03]** That's what I'm seeing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:10]** Do I still get the plus two from my encouragement or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** Oh, that's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:14]** Because it's a single player, right?

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:16]** That's how it's phrased.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:22]** And we'll provide a bonus on a targeted check.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:23]** Oh, okay.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:24]** So I shouldn't have used it on this one.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:27]** Yeah, I feel like if it had just said you get a plus two.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:28]** Look at that.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:29]** 24.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:32]** Passed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:34]** Nice.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:36]** It says the tier of the enemy ship.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:38]** Fly by.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:39]** Fly by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:42]** You must succeed at a piloting check, the tier of the internship.

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:47]** All right, so your handy dandy thing that you gave to me, which is your fault, Kev, is wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:48]** I pulled it off the internet, man.

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:49]** I don't know.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:50]** It's wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:53]** You didn't verify your source before you gave it to the GM?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:54]** Kevin.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:55]** No, because it's a guide.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** It's not a reference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:59]** It just looks so beautiful.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:01]** Yeah, it's really good, dude.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:02]** It's so wrong.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:06]** And it says right here, ST instead of EST.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** Because that's what it should say.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:15]** According to the very top of the page, it has the difficulty check, and it says base value, starship tier.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:18]** And it has a little E that says enemy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:22]** And on flyby, it says DC-1515ST.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** Hold on.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:28]** In version 3, they'll correct it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:32]** I think in any case, I passed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:42]** Yes, except in the core rulebook on page 319, it says the DC is 20 plus two times the tier of the enemy starship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:43]** For flyby?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:44]** Yeah.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:45]** That's...

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:47]** That's wild.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:49]** That seems crazy to me.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:52]** Where did they get 15 plus 1.5 ST?

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:54]** Is that in Starship Operations?

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:56]** No, it's in the core book.

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:58]** Page 319.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:05]** I must have an old version because it says DC 15 plus 1.5 times the tier of a new ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:06]** Oh, they must have changed it.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:12]** I have probably the original, so I think they lowered it because yours is newer than what mine would have been the PDF.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:13]** 319.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:15]** Mine also says 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:16]** Okay, mine says 20.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:19]** So I think that's an errata.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:21]** That's wild.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:28]** I mean, they probably did it because they know that 20 is like... I mean, this would be a big pilot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:30]** And Archives of Nethis says 15.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:35]** Yeah, but that's just the internet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:38]** No, Archives of Nethis is official.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:40]** Yeah, they keep it updated.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:43]** All right, cool.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:44]** So you succeed.

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:45]** I f***ing love this.

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:47]** Oh my gosh.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** It paid off.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:50]** You guys.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:52]** Burn it.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:54]** Burn that thing down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:56]** Everyone empty your guns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:59]** So the question is what?

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:01]** Okay.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:03]** All right.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:04]** They are going to move.

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:07]** Wait, are we shooting as we're flying by?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:08]** But we still had to fly by.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:11]** They still have to fly by no matter what, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:16]** But didn't we get to attack them during our movement?

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:17]** That's not the whole problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:19]** On the gunnery round, you take that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:21]** No, it happens on the gunnery round.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:22]** So weird.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:26]** So we basically just did a starship-based acrobatics check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:28]** But it's at range one.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:31]** It's at range one is what we get to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:32]** Exactly.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:38]** So that means that if that's in the arc for the turret, then... Of course it's in the arc for the turret.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:40]** Yeah, for the appropriate one, then that's fine.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:43]** The idea is that these happen concurrently.

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:48]** So as they are about to move, you snuck in a flyby.

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:49]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:53]** You will still get that attack in addition to the other attack, I think.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:56]** I think that you get both attacks.


## Speaker_0

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:56]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:57]** Nice.

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:58]** Okay.

**[01:07:58 - 01:08:01]** So even though they are moving away, you still get both attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:03]** Yeah, but are they in our forward arc?

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:04]** Are they in our rear arc?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:05]** Well, we get to choose which arc.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:07]** Because now they're in our rear arc.

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:11]** We get to choose which arc is used as one hex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:17]** Yeah, and it looks like to me that it's on a fault line between two arcs.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:19]** So you can choose which arc it's in.

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:23]** So before I move, which one do you want to use?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:26]** Well, I think that's because we're not pointed perfectly at a side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:34]** Well, I thought the whole point of this was to shoot it as like you're flying by and it's the forward arc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:35]** Effectively, we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:37]** No, it's any arc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:39]** But he's allowed to move before we do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:40]** Okay.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:40]** Right.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:45]** But like for the flyby, we can use our forward firing arc is what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:46]** No matter how far away he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:48]** Correct.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:52]** But do we want to use the... Actually, it doesn't matter because you want to use the net, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:52]** Yes.

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:55]** And the net can point at any arc.

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:55]** Yeah.

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:56 - 01:09:01]** And it has a shorter range.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:05]** We're more likely to be in range still with another arc.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:07]** Hit it with the net!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:09]** Starring Sandra Bullock.

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:10]** If you like to move it, move it, John.

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:10]** Go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:12]** I love that movie so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:14]** You would.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:16]** It's like Hotmail in a movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:22]** It was advanced for its time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:25]** It was advanced for its time.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:26]** All right.

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:42]** They move, and the way that they move as you're flying by, you can't see anything inside of that black dome at the top of the ship.

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:46]** But the way that they move is so on a dime.

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:57]** They pivot, turn, twist, and just spin and, like, fly in this erratic pattern, not technically, that moves all away from you all so quickly.

**[01:09:58 - 01:10:01]** Yeah, the advantage of great ships, for sure, apparently.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:01]** Yeah.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:18]** the shape of it so drive i'm gonna point the uh thing where it needs to go and then we'll be good all righty so it's gonna be our gunnery round they have moved to about nine hexes

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:42]** to the left and are facing forward against y'all if you can quite tell what forward is you can see that it is but it tends to be the same position every time what's going to happen in gunnery so you all get two gunnery rolls right is that right but one of them is the flyby i don't believe it's a free attack got it but since we have two gunners we still get two attacks

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:44]** Right.


## Speaker_0

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:48]** So these are going to happen at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:51]** Hit them where it hurts, gentlemen.

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:51]** Give them hell.

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:52]** Give them hell, Rick.

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:54]** Now we can do it.

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:55]** And you call it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:55 - 01:10:58]** I am picking them up on the aft starboard side.

**[01:10:58 - 01:11:01]** I believe I can still hit them with the light particle beam.

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:03]** Correction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:05]** Port side.

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:06]** I thought you were in the Navy.

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:10]** I mean, I thought you were in the Navy, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:11]** I was, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:14]** Which way is port?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:15]** Left.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:17]** Port is to the left because it's got four letters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:21]** I would like to amend this judgment because that's not how it's written.

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:22]** What's not how it's written?

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:26]** You get to choose one arc of your starship's weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:26 - 01:11:27]** Of their ship.

**[01:11:27 - 01:11:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:31]** As if it were in close range.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:37]** So, like, is that... When it says one arc, is that to say that it's, like, forward aft port starboard?

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:38]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:44]** Yeah, which is just to say that since you're on the turret, my guess is that you can fire anywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:53]** But my point is, if Kev is on the starboard arc, then we should choose the starboard arc...

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:56]** and thereby get this flyby bonus for both attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:58]** Sorry, flyby does what?

**[01:11:58 - 01:12:00]** Oh, because you choose an arc to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:04]** I think you get... That's how it reads to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:05]** I think you're right about that then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:09]** So for both... I think we should ask the rules, the paralegals, but... Ooh.

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:13]** You select one arc of your starship's weapons, plural.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:14]** That's not a good idea.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:19]** So if you had three gunners all using the starboard weapon... Against any quadrant of the enemy starship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:21]** Then they could all shoot during a flyby.

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:22]** I think you're right about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:25]** That doesn't seem right.

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:26]** Like you're all taking turns at the same gun.

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:28]** No, we're all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:31]** No, if you have three different gunners all using it.

**[01:12:31 - 01:12:34]** If you had three guns on the starboard side and you had three gunners sitting on those three guns.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:35]** Right.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:37]** You could all use it during the flyby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:37]** Correct.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:38]** Because that's.

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:39]** Sure.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:39]** Yeah.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:41]** That's the way the ship is facing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:42]** So we should get four attacks then.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:44]** We should have an attack for each gunner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:45]** No, it's just you still have to number.

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:46]** Number for each gunner.

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:47]** Using flyby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:48]** One for gunner.

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:49]** So two.

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:49]** Yes.

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:50]** Cool.

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:53]** In that case, let's roll them up, gentlemen.

**[01:12:56 - 01:12:57]** Put them where it hurts.

**[01:12:58 - 01:12:59]** And by gentlemen, I mean me and Kev.

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:00]** Godspeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:03]** You guys get a plus nine, plus whatever.

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:04]** Plus one.

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:05]** Oh, no, no, not for you, Kev.

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:06]** Never mind.

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:10]** Just make sure you get a plus nine for your base attack bonus with the weapon, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:11]** It should already be calculated in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:13]** Yeah, but they're not using.

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:14]** He's using his coin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:16]** Plus nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:20]** Plus your regular dex, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:20]** Isn't it?

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:25]** Did you calculate it all out, the whole thing, Kev?

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:25]** I double-checked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:28]** It's equal to my ranged attack bonus.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:29]** Okay.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:30]** So, plus nine.

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:33]** So, 21 against your shooting which weapon?

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:38]** 21 with the port light particle beam.

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:41]** Port light particle beam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:44]** Okay.

**[01:13:44 - 01:13:48]** You fire that.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:50]** So...

**[01:13:51 - 01:13:52]** Okay.

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:54]** And... Colandine Brand.

**[01:13:55 - 01:13:56]** Well, I'll tell you, Kev.

**[01:13:56 - 01:13:56]** That hits.

**[01:13:57 - 01:13:58]** Against AC.

**[01:13:58 - 01:13:58]** Yes!

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:00]** That hits.

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:03]** Which quadrant is that for me?

**[01:14:03 - 01:14:04]** Is that the one that I'm facing now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:05]** We get to pick which quadrant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:05 - 01:14:06]** The way that I'm facing now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:08]** Yeah.

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:10]** Uh... So pick a quadrant, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:15]** Wait, you get to pick which quadrant this hits for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:17]** Against any quadrant of the enemy starship.

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:18]** Because of the flyby.

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:19]** Brad?

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:20]** Because of the flyby.

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:20]** Uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:23]** But that's for both?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:28]** That's for both attacks?

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:31]** That feels like it would make sense for one because you're able to get one off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:33]** No, it makes perfect sense.

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:35]** We would be targeting the same quadrant.

**[01:14:36 - 01:14:41]** We're using the same side of the ship to hit a specific target.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:43]** I am targeting the aft section.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:47]** Right in the keister.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:49]** Because I'm assuming the aft has lower...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:56]** I mean, it's not like a... I feel like it's an alien gray ship that's an orb.

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:59]** Does it have sides?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:02 - 01:15:02]** Four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:05]** Total of ten damage from me.

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:14]** Okay, so ten damage from you for... Against which quadrant of my... Aft quadrant.

**[01:15:14 - 01:15:16]** Aft quadrant.


## Speaker_0

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:16]** Okay.

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:27]** Basically, what we're doing is we're saying our flyby on the port side, you came about, your a** came to our port through the flyby, and that's when we decided to fire.

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:30]** That makes perfect sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:30 - 01:15:30]** Yep.

**[01:15:30 - 01:15:31]** Sounds good.

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:33]** So, Colin Edenbrand, your shot.

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:34]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:35 - 01:15:39]** Actually, I would have gone forward just to have that heavier, whatever.

**[01:15:39 - 01:15:40]** I'm sticking to it.

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:41]** Port side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:51]** Now, the reason why you want to scan, because I'm just thinking about it now, is that I don't know what your shield values are at and when you divert them.

**[01:15:52 - 01:16:00]** So you might want to target ones that are at different numbers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:01]** You see what I'm saying?

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:04]** Or we just poke a hole in his ass and he deflates like a balloon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:07]** What a great mental picture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:07 - 01:16:09]** Why is that like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:10 - 01:16:10]** Thank you for that.

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:12]** Thank you for that.

**[01:16:12 - 01:16:12]** All right.

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:16]** So since you're firing a net weapon, I think it's a little different.

**[01:16:16 - 01:16:16]** Is it?

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:18]** I don't know that it is.

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:19]** Aren't you firing a net weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:20]** Heavy net laser?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:24]** But I don't think it's... Is it different?

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:26]** God, why is it different every time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:27 - 01:16:27]** Yeah, what is different?

**[01:16:27 - 01:16:27]** I'm looking.

**[01:16:28 - 01:16:29]** It's a laser net.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:31]** Heavy laser net.

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:32]** It has a plus 12?

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:35]** Yeah, that's what I'm also trying to look at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:38]** Is it a direct fire weapon or a tracking weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:40]** It is a direct fire weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:40 - 01:16:40]** It's direct fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:40 - 01:16:41]** Okay, cool.

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:42]** Then it targets AC.

**[01:16:42 - 01:16:42]** Great.

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:45]** I thought that it was a tracking weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:46]** Cool.

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:46]** Gotcha.

**[01:16:47 - 01:16:47]** Give me your roll.

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:50]** Okay, got it.

**[01:16:50 - 01:16:52]** Stand by just a moment.

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:54]** Remember the plus one, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:54]** Did somebody?

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:55]** Yes.

**[01:16:56 - 01:16:56]** I'm so sorry.

**[01:16:56 - 01:16:59]** I clicked on the wrong ship and I was adjusting the shields.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:16:59 - 01:16:59]** Cool.

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:00]** I already adjusted our shields.

**[01:17:00 - 01:17:01]** Here we go.


## Speaker_0

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:02]** Right.

**[01:17:03 - 01:17:06]** I was trying to click on my ship to adjust my shields, and I clicked on your ship accident.

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:08]** That is a 21 to hit?

**[01:17:09 - 01:17:11]** That is a hit.

**[01:17:11 - 01:17:12]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:13 - 01:17:13]** Here we go.

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:18]** This net 5d6 is a...

**[01:17:18 - 01:17:39]** point weapon okay meaning um the gunner of the targeted starship can attempt an immediate governor recheck if he wants with the point weapon against oh sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry never mind this is inverse i thought this was saying that we could use that they could track

**[01:17:39 - 01:18:09]** like fire against this weapon to stop committing their ship but no this means that i can use this weapon to target tracking weapon trapping tracking ordinance on its way to us in order to take out tracking weapons headed to our ship nevermind i misinterpreted uh cool so that's a hit for 5d6 yikes for sure hitting the aft hit that critical threshold that is a lot

**[01:18:09 - 01:18:11]** That is a lot.

**[01:18:12 - 01:18:14]** That is a lot.

**[01:18:16 - 01:18:18]** That even feels damaged.

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:19]** Slash roll.

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:21]** 5d6.

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:22]** Here we go, gentlemen.

**[01:18:22 - 01:18:22]** Are we ready?

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:27]** That is 24 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:29 - 01:18:31]** Right up the poop shoe.

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:32]** Wow.

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:34]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:34 - 01:18:35]** Heavy laser net.

**[01:18:36 - 01:18:38]** Just like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:18:41 - 01:18:43]** Yeah.

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:44]** The way that they explode.

**[01:18:45 - 01:18:50]** I feel like both those weapons just hit even the same point on the ship.

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:52]** Yeah.

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:56]** Because you see the ship trying just in the same hex trying to stabilize.

**[01:18:57 - 01:19:05]** There is a clear debris that has just like a part of the hall has just definitely come off.

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:09]** This ship is very damaged.


## Speaker_0

**[01:19:10 - 01:19:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:11 - 01:19:14]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:14 - 01:19:15]** We'll see what happens.

**[01:19:15 - 01:19:18]** How many rounds is this Starship combat going to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:18 - 01:19:19]** Because when y'all hit, y'all hit.

**[01:19:19 - 01:19:20]** When you miss, you miss.

**[01:19:20 - 01:19:26]** But when you hit, that was a... That was a tasty lick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:26 - 01:19:28]** The only reason I missed is because I couldn't see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:28 - 01:19:33]** Dr. Okay with the flyby was the reason that y'all couldn't nail it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:34 - 01:19:35]** That was a good call.

**[01:19:35 - 01:19:39]** Just like hitting wombats in my T-16 back home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:38 - 01:19:42]** Good game, everyone.

**[01:19:42 - 01:19:42]** Good stuff.

**[01:19:42 - 01:19:43]** Good game.

**[01:19:44 - 01:19:44]** See y'all next week.

**[01:19:44 - 01:19:45]** Good game.

**[01:19:45 - 01:19:46]** Bye, everyone.

**[01:19:46 - 01:19:46]** Bye, guys.
