**[00:00:01 - 00:00:26]** Previously on Will Save Rick-19, the relentless robot risk-taker, raises an alarm regarding the revolting refreshment roaming through the realization that reality has raced forward, and rushes to rouse his fellow rogues only to realize that the routine rhythm of a day wasn't the only reminder that ruined their rest, but the rawness of residues and ruthless extractions they can't recall.

**[00:00:26 - 00:00:35]** Colin then comes to conjure a curious chapter from an Akatonian chronicle and considers a course of hypnosis to clear their clouded consciousness.

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:40]** Will the cause of their common circumstance be some common casual cosmic curiosity?

**[00:00:40 - 00:00:45]** Or have they been caught in the crossfire of a clandestine conflict?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on Will Save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:31]** Not this song.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** That song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:36]** Because you've come to the right place.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:43]** I am your temporal GM, John Swan.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:47]** And with me are our four amazing cast members.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:50]** And my question for you is, what is your name and which...

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** Power Ranger would you be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** Take it away, Kelly.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** Well, damn it.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** My name is Kelly Gilliam.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:02]** The Power Ranger that I most liked as a kid was the Black Ranger.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:04]** So I had his whole outfit and everything.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** I guess I'd be him.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:08]** Because Zach was f***ing dope.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** Yeah, he was cool.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:09]** Yeah, he was dope.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** Also, all of your outfits are only black.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** I know.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** That was the beginning of it.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:18]** Did you also breakdance as a child?

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:21]** I did briefly, not super well necessarily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:24]** Have you seen Kelly and Zach in the same room?

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Was he a breakdancer?

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** Zach was definitely a breakdancer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** He would breakdance fight.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** What the fuck?

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** Okay, I guess I forgot.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:36]** Yeah, after that was the green one, but I had a Green Ranger Slammer, but it was Black Ranger for me.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:37]** Slammer?

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Like the Pog?

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Pogs?

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** Because he wasn't a doctor, but...

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:39]** Does anybody watch the requel movie that came out on Netflix?

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:39]** No.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:40]** It's on my list.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** It's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** A bit of nostalgia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:43]** I watched it.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** It was fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Yeah.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** It was tough.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:53]** Did they shoot it before the guy that played Jason tragically passed away?

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Passed away, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** I don't know if I've heard this.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:59]** They have the Gen 3 or 4 Jason.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** Sorry, not Jason.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:00]** Tommy.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:01]** Tommy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** Tommy.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** The actor that played Tommy, just tragically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:09]** I think they were in the middle of filming it, but he wasn't involved in the project.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Okay.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:11]** Yeah.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** Rest in peace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** Indeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:13]** Yep.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:22]** No, they brought in the Pink Ranger and the Red Ranger from the sequel series, but they had the original blue and black, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:48]** if i remember right and then uh the yellow ranger tragically passed away in a car accident yeah you know 90s yeah but they do a good tribute to her oh that's cool trainee man yeah anyways who are you gonna be vinny will um this is tough because i don't want to pick one that's already been picked but i would absolutely inequivocally have been the blue ranger like oh so much of my wardrobe is already blue


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:48 - 00:05:12]** um i'm already like that's sort of how my mind works well lucky for me there's a height requirement for the blue ranger what do you mean you have to be like under a certain height is that what you're saying that's true like jenny would be the blue ranger in like the viking like you know power rangers


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:37]** for all of the hispanic vikings yeah amazing yeah that would have been dope i don't know i always thought that the the like flute piccolo penny whistle sort of daggers yes was fascinating like i would have loved to play that as a kid same that sounds familiar

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** Can you buy this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:43]** I bet you can I do like I like the white Ranger over the green range.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:52]** Yeah, which they're yeah spoiler alert same person Dragon dagger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** Yes, that's what it was.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:58]** Oh What flute thing are you talking about?

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:00]** That sounds really familiar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:02]** His dagger was his flute that would call the dragon sword.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:07]** I had that toy where it was the flute and the dagger together.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** That's a real thing you could have bought back then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** I had all of the swords.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** I had the turtle.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:16]** You guys remember the big turtle that would come and deliver them?

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** I don't at all.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** I have no idea what you're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** No idea?

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:20]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** I'd have to look it up.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** It's like Tor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:23]** I think it was just Tor.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** To be fair, I was laughing a lot on Polite Tor.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** I don't remember either.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:30]** But, like, it makes sense that there would be something like that in Power Rangers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:33]** Isn't there, like, a creation myth where it's, like, turtles all the way down?

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:33]** Yes, there is.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:35]** There is such a thing.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** And the turtle's name is Tor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:45]** The other day with somebody else about, yeah, the philosophical idea that it's just we live on a turtle that was on top of another turtle that was on top of another turtle and it just goes all the way down.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:48]** It's weird that they... Tor the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** Shuttlezord.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:52]** That's right.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:54]** Came from Thunderzords.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** Thunderzords.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:59]** Yes.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:05]** So Will... For the listeners that don't know, Will and I both have 3D printers and we talk about 3D printing every so often.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:09]** I'm definitely about to find an STL file for this f***ing dagger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:10]** Oh yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:13]** You gotta do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** Will...

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** You said you would be the Blue Ranger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:17]** Yes.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:19]** Will is very technically capable.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** I have no justification for why.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:25]** I mean, I think I had a crush on the Pink Ranger.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** I think everyone did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** Everyone had a crush on Kimberly.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:31]** Kimberly.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** For sure.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:33]** I don't know.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:34]** I was more of a Trini fan.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** Actually, I liked them both.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:38]** But, yeah, Trini died, of course.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:41]** And then Kimberly, Kimberly, she still looks really good.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** Last I saw.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** She's very, like...

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:45]** I want your skin routine, Kimberly.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:48]** So reach out to willsaythepodcast.gmail.com and let me know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** I thought you were about to say, like, yeah, we got lunch last week.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** Yeah, I was like, wow, man.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** What a flex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** Plug for her skin routine.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** Like, it's actually, like, branded.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** She's my nan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** I did used to hang out in the same... Oh, yeah?

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:06]** I hung out in the same circle as Johnny Yongbosh.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** But that was it.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** And I didn't know him that well.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:12]** He's actually... He does the voice of Ichigo from...

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** Bleach.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** He's an anime voice actor too.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** Oh, that's cool.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** Yeah.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:17]** Johnny Unbush is cool.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** Dang.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:18]** Nice.


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:19]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:20]** Wow.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** I forget which Ranger you played.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** Well, on that note.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:22]** Anyway, there we go.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** On that note.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:27]** John, why do you always skip yourself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:30]** Yeah, I always just forget because I'm like, yo, let's play.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** I 100% was Green Ranger all the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:38]** I was just like Green Ranger vibes, especially when Green Ranger became the White Ranger.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** I was like, yo, that's rad.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** It was cool.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:41]** Please.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:42]** Pretty dope.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:43]** Yeah, it's cool.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** Especially the Dragon Dagger, which now I want one.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:47]** That would be cool.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** I'll see if I can pick it up for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** See if Vinny can print one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** Go, go, Power Rangers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:58]** We might have to have Will do it because Will's printer is bigger than mine.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** Will's got that printer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** If I can ever get it to work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:04]** It is a good f***ing song.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** It's almost up there with the Pokemon one.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:12]** Almost, but the Pokemon one is... There is no better intro than the Pokemon intro.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:15]** It's like Pokemon, Power Rangers, X-Men, I feel.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** I can't think of it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:21]** I don't remember what episode that was, but the Digimon argument.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:23]** Oh, my God.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:26]** Let's not get into that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:29]** Digimon opening is trash, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:33]** Let's return to the threefold conspiracy.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:36]** Where there are no Power Rangers that we know of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:37]** Yeah.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** But I'm sure there are some.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:41]** Anything could happen, though, at this point, to be honest.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:43]** What if the Power Rangers were all greys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Yeah.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:46]** Wait, can you say that again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** Their heads are kind of shaped.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** That's true.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:49]** They do.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** They have the eyes kind of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:52]** Yeah.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:55]** All Power Rangers are greys.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** They're already there.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:56]** So.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:58]** They're already there.

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:03]** By way of short recap.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:10]** last episode was i think as kev said it hey do you guys want to go on another adventure


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** You made it sound... Sorry.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:16]** I'm sorry.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** I didn't mean to interrupt.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:21]** You made it sound like it was, like, Frodo from Lord of the Rings.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:24]** In reality, he was really, like, sighing, like, depressingly.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** It's not, like, a positive thing, Jon.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** Stop trying to make this better than it is.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** It's terrible.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:31]** That's my goal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** That's always what I'm trying to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** Trying to bring you over to the dark side.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:41]** So, Rick19 has a merry time.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:48]** And with Pike's ferretins watching the Brutaris match.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:54]** And at the end, as the TVs flip off, Rick gets curious.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:57]** Starts thinking, asking questions.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** There are some odd moments.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:04]** Torv's eye, the dwarf, has changed color.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** Gnarla walks out quickly.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:13]** Rick is suspicious and starts to move down the hall as the party wraps up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:16]** If he had his gun on him, he would have shot all of them.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** Of course he would have.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:17]** Murder bot.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** I'm kidding, that's a joke.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** That's a murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** Once again.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:25]** I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** I'm kidding.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:30]** I'm definitely kidding, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** I am definitely kidding.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:35]** I am 100% shaking my head and saying I'm kidding at the same time.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:39]** Moves in to the room with Hears.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:44]** And in trying to understand...

**[00:11:44 - 00:12:11]** what has caused these seemingly disparate events of food being warm, TV turning off, match over, eye change, realizes that Rick and I-10 has a blemish on their forearm as if they've been pricked with a needle several dozens of times.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:18]** hears, stands up, feels their body as if they can't control it.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:26]** They have to maintain mental effort to take control of their body or else it will stop moving and then they're able to move through it.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:35]** But as they step up to freshen up and look in the mirror, Rick lets them know that two inches of their antenna has been snipped off.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** It's f***ing furious, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** It's not cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:45]** Dr. OK wakes up feeling refreshed, except for like spa refreshed.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** Good, you know, Korean spa.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:49]** Great.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** Except for your right arm.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:59]** It's been dehydrated and rehydrated and dried out and then freshened up and dried out and freshened up over and over and over and over again.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:04]** It looks fine, but it just feels tender and dry and scaly almost.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:18]** And Colin stands up and realizes that he has a scar from the top of his lower abs down to the top of his pelvis, about two inches, an angry scar.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:29]** Rick 19 has a talk with Shea and they confirm that 24 hours of time are missing.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** from their memories.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** We ended Last Step with Colin.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** The four of you were about to go talk to Shay.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** And Colin remembered.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:58]** It seems weird, but hypnosis has proven to be effective at reproducing the memories that otherwise are reticent or hidden or missing, let's say.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** Quotation marks.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:05]** So that's where we're going to pick back up.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** What are the four of you doing?

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:14]** You should be on the void crier as we jump back into Foundry here, standing in the room where Dr. OK and Colin were sleeping.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:15]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:22]** All I can say is that every time you say 24 hours, it keeps flashing me back to episode one, Array Start with Zero.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Oh, I got a bug.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** Sorry.


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:25]** Boop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** That was fast.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** It was like in my face.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:35]** And I just, everything, I hear that 24 hours, hours, hours.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** That's just calling back to me.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:39]** And I'm like, man, this is suspicious.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** This is very suspicious.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:43]** Anyways, Rick notices Colin.

**[00:14:44 - 00:15:00]** like he he did a mysticism check like we were all like figuring out our own things but like colin is in his own head and rick sienna kind of questioned that like what's on your mind colin so clarifying i'm just an irish accent there sorry

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** What's on your mind?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** It just comes out of you, Kev.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:07]** It's funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** I'm emulating it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:17]** Is this like, in American terms, like saw it on an episode of Springer or like is actually legit?

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:22]** Like near legit pseudoscience, near legit pseudoscience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:34]** And one of the ones where they walk you through how to do it, you know, like, you know, I'm thinking like ancient mysteries with Leonard Nimoy, where they would have a reenactment and the person like the subject would sit down and then it's like the person with fog.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:35]** Yeah.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:39]** So in a sense, you know how to do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:39 - 00:16:00]** mechanically so there is a mechanism to let it happen well i might too then being a mystic right oh no he would because of his video i'm sorry if you are trained in diplomacy and mysticism then you are capable of using these techniques guess who's trained in diplomacy and mysticism um boy the uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:06]** I remember something from when I was Akiton.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:14]** There was something about how to recover some lost memories.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:15]** Right.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:25]** You can swing a circle left or right and hypnotize someone to get their memories back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** Sounds like quackery.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:30]** But I've heard of such a technique, though.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:32]** I've never seen it up close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:36]** Well, at this point, we've seen some crazy things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:39]** I mean, at this point, we could try anything, really.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:44]** I can theoretically do it if you could teach me the way I can help you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Let's see if it works first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:49]** I'll volunteer to be hypnotized.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** To be the subject?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:56]** I feel like my memory might be the best to investigate.

**[00:16:56 - 00:17:01]** Since I was involved, I was out in the group when it happened.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** Can a construct do that, though?

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** Be hypnotized?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** I think...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** I say we try it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** They can.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** We'll see what happens.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:13]** I'll also say that you could do anybody or any NPC.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:19]** So Torv, for instance, who also showed... A little bit of kidnapping and hypnosis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:23]** I'm liking it.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:23]** I mean, you can just talk to her.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:25]** Hey, how's it going, by the way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** Just trying to wave it in front of their face.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:33]** Rick, I think you might have the most valuable memories.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:36]** Start there and see where we go, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:39]** And Rick just kind of nods, and he sits down on the bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:39]** Dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:40]** He asks first.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** He's like, do you mind?

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:42]** It's cool.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:43]** And he sits down on your bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:45]** Okay.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:54]** I'm going to need Colin to give me either a mysticism or diplomacy check, whichever is the lowest bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:02]** So a construct does have a plus two racial bonus against mind effects and sleep.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:05]** So it might be more difficult, but I don't think it's impossible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:14]** I think if you're willing, I'm not going to add that to the DC that it takes for Colin to successfully do this to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:16]** This feels like an important role.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** We can't assist, right?

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** Because we don't.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** We didn't see the video.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** I think you could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:27]** You won't need to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** You won't need to, he says.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** I rolled an 18 on the die.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:34]** Diplomacy is plus 8 for a total of 26.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:35]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:38]** And I sure hope that's high enough.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:38]** 26.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:42]** Otherwise, it's going to be a long, we'll save Wednesday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:52]** Rick, I think I will narrate what you go through unless you would like to.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:54]** It worked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** Just want to make sure that you're okay with that.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** Or how far we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:20]** you sit down on the bed rick what do you say colin like hypnotize us all right rick which uh and he like reaches into his uh his pack and pulls out like a locket on a chain just focus oh perception check what's on your locket

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:23]** I didn't perceive much.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:24]** Cool.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:27]** You can see that the locket is metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:36]** It says, if you're reading this, f*** you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:39]** It's a calligraphy script that says Rick is a murder bot.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:42]** If you can read this, you're feeling very sleepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:46]** He had it the whole time.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** Amazing.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** Ever since he saw that show.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:49]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:52]** Colin is the third fold.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:52]** You had no idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:53]** Yeah.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** I suspected it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:04]** So he's swinging it back and forth in sort of a pendulum motion, and he says, All right, Vic, focus.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** Focus on the locket.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:08]** All right.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:13]** Now relax from the top of your head down to the bottom of your toes.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:22]** You're getting sleepy.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:26]** Very, very sleepy.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:29]** You're relaxing.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:32]** And now, now you're remembering.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:38]** You're remembering everything that happened in the last 24 hours.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:47]** And I'm hoping at some point John's going to step in and you'll feel a rush of memories, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:59]** Rick, with your eyes closed, you begin to hear the sounds first of the game, the Brutars match.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:07]** There's a sense of envelopment and warmth.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** Flash forward, people are cheering.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:42]** flash forward and you're sitting on your bed and you can't move your body there is a strong urge in you to leave your body and as you sit you don't fight the urge to

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** There's white light.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:52]** There's a pinprick, one tiny pinprick in your right arm.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** There's a face over you, black.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:07]** That pinprick is repeating over and over and over and over and over in your arm and your back on your bed.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:27]** And you stand up and you very clearly remember walking out the door as does everyone else on the lower deck.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:39]** And the people in the galley who you were with, you all walk back in single formation.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:44]** back to the exact position that you were at.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:51]** 24 hours later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** F***ing graze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:55]** And you feel yourself start to come to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:09]** I think as soon as Rick wakes up, he doesn't even realize he fell asleep, but he's having this memory flashes, and then he immediately grabs his side pistol and cocks it.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:13]** And you guys are like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:16]** Did it work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:16]** Cool it.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** It's the greys.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** It had to be the greys.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** And he explains everything.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:27]** He's like, you know, I found myself sitting on the bed.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:42]** A face with gray, black eyes was looking at me and then the pinprick and we filed ourselves right back out into the mess decks to watch the rest of the game.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:44]** It has to be the greys.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** They're here.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** They're involved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:49]** Yeah, so the Greys are behind all this conspiracy stuff.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:52]** It would seem to be the case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:57]** And then Rick realizes he's got the pistol in his hand, and he's like, sorry about that.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** He holsters it.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** It's fine, man.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** Calm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:00]** Get it.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** Safe space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:01]** For sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:09]** I do think we should try this on someone else to make sure, confirm this.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:13]** If this is the Greys, each of us would have seen something different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** I also volunteer.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:16]** Okay.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:17]** All right.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** Let's see.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:22]** But I wanted to see if Bernice also experienced this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:26]** You should just... Bernice should just record.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:27]** Let's see.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** Great idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** A great idea.


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:32]** Great.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:32]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** Computer shit.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** What do you want to do first?

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:46]** Do you want to see what Bernice does or are Hears and Dr. O'K going to submit to hypnosis if Colin's able to make it happen?

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** Okay, I'll decide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:54]** Sorry, what was the question?

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** Who was that a question for?

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:56]** All of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:01]** I saw all those gears turning and John was just like, alright, moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:06]** Yeah, just in the interest of time, but I'm happy to let you decide if you were just thinking that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:10]** I'd like to check Bernice and see if she has any recollection of this story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:21]** Bernice, as you begin to talk to Bernice, you recall that

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:32]** Bernice doesn't have recording capabilities, but Bernice obviously saw everything and you're able to see through Bernice's eyes, but you don't have a camera that can record.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:37]** So Bernice can tell you everything that Bernice saw.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:49]** And as you talk to Bernice around 1132 PM is when

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:54]** There's a... Bernice says her feed was cut.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:57]** It's odd.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** Just lost power.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:12]** At 11.33, Bernice actually comes back too.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:19]** And there is a long period, hour,

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:30]** After hour, after hour of time where Bernice saw nothing.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:38]** And then Bernice tells you that this white light illuminated the entire hallway.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:47]** And at the same time, the doors all opened in the lower deck.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:57]** And Bernice seemed to see, yeah, everyone walked back to where they were.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:02]** And then that light moved away.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:11]** Bernice also thinks that if there's another drone on board, like melt the man.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:19]** Maybe Melt-A-Man has some sort of recording capability, and you could ask Melt-A-Man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** Hmm, guys.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:30]** Bernice kind of confirms, saw some strange lights and, well, us apparently going back into our rooms.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:41]** She's got a, she has a blank sort of a moment, though, but she suggested we look into the other drone that Melt-A-Man has.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** I say we do it.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:47]** Is it possible to hypnotize Bernice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** Can you imagine?

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:54]** It is, but I think she's shared everything she might have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:55]** Yeah.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** You have a couple of options here.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** You can... Your first thing was to talk to Shaye.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** Don't forget that.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** You can always talk to Shay.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** You can hypnotize again.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:11]** There is a role every time for each person, but you can hypnotize Dr. OK, here's.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:19]** And the first bet, Rick19, that you thought you could hypnotize any of the Pyke's Peritons.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:25]** Obviously, Torv is the only one that you know besides the four of you who have some sort of physical connection.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:46]** effect so they are a candidate you can also talk to melt a man and see if melt a man has any recordings of what happened thoughts well i'm interested in looking at that other bot perhaps yeah doctor i think that's a good idea


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:53]** I think we should hypnotize one of the other PCs real quick and just to confirm if there's any grays in their vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:58]** Those are both not bad ideas to see if there's any more information to be had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:02]** I'm willing to submit to hypnosis.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:05]** I know you said you as well.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:07]** I think you volunteered a bit earlier though, Doc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** So you're good.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** Go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** All right, Doctor.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:11]** Have a seat.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:18]** Give me your lowest check and hypnotize us.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:22]** Colin, I'm going to go dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** I'm visually going dark.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:26]** Colin's going to f*** this up, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:28]** That startled me.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:30]** I didn't see John do that earlier.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:32]** I had my eyes closed.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:34]** And then I open them up and John's blacked out.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:34]** And I'm here.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** I'm like, ah.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:36]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** That's an 11.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:38]** 11.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** 11.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** Okay.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:44]** And John immediately turns his lights on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:50]** No, his lights are still off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** Let's see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Hypnotize.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:52]** What do you say?

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:56]** Dr. K sits down on the bed after Rick gets up.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Have a look at this locket.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:03]** You see it swaying back and forth.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:10]** As you see it sway, you feel your mind rocking back and forth.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:21]** like it's on an ice-cold sea, in a boat, just swaying with the waves lapping in the wind.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:30]** You check the life well in that boat, and inside that life well are your memories from the last 24 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:34]** What do you see, Dr. O'Keefe?

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:42]** There's a memory in the boat in front of you, Dr. Okay, that you reach out to in your head.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** And you grab it.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:49]** And it starts to take over your body.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** There's no interruption.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:54]** It's a lucid thought.

**[00:30:57 - 00:31:00]** And you recall yourself waking up.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** And there's an urge for you to sit up.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:24]** So you sit up, your feet hits the floor and you very distinctly recall the feeling of your body leaving the void crier.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** What?

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:33]** And moving and the void crier just gets smaller and smaller and smaller.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:42]** And then your arm, your right arm, is in a machine.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:51]** And the pain keeps increasing every time the machine...

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:03]** And I need you to give me a will save, Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** Will save!

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** That is 17.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:11]** 17.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:13]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:14]** on the bed.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:18]** Colin Hears and Rick19, you're seeing Dr. O.K.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:20]** What are you doing?

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:23]** How is your body reacting to this pain as you're reliving this memory?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:31]** Uh, I guess I'm like, just to be clear, I'm like strapped down in my lucid sort of visualization, right?

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:34]** Like I'm unable to, you're not quite sure.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** You're not quite sure.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** Okay.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:44]** So I'm just flailing around like every trail from my body is like in full animation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:46]** Rick kind of like puts his hands out.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:49]** Like he's about to pin, like not pin you down, but like try to subdue you.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:53]** But then he kind of backs up and he's like, maybe we should just let this happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:54]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:58]** His body starts to stop flailing and Dr. Okay.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:11]** In your mind, you remember looking left and looking right and seeing here's lying flat.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:15]** Colin, lying flat.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:18]** What the f***?

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** And others.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** And you wake up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:22]** Hey, doctor.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** Are you okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:35]** I felt as though, yes, I am here now, but we were another place.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:43]** We were off the ship and we must have been abducted in the night and placed back here.

**[00:33:43 - 00:34:08]** as it were and uh yeah we were all there unconscious on beds flying out flat or maybe semi-conscious or just you know lucid dreaming stuck you know like sleep paralysis or something something terrifying and uh the pain oh my god they just kept increasing it

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** I don't know to what end, but... Who are they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Did you... What do they look like?

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** Did you see someone?

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** I didn't see any greys, did I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:16]** You did not.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:19]** No, but, like... I didn't see any greys.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:22]** There's a movie called, like, The Fourth Kind.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:26]** And I think, like, this is straight out of that.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:30]** Where, like, they put you through hypnosis and you start levitating off the bed.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:32]** This is, like, a grey thing, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:33 - 00:35:00]** and grace i mean it does sound like grace yeah i i'm going to contact every horror story i've heard about grace so you just are you ready yeah but yeah before you do that i'll do it yeah what's up rick before you actually like get into it uh rick is going to message shay in his comms and say what is your status i believe we might have some kind of insight on what is happening here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Hey, yeah.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** I'm very curious about your insight.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:10]** I think we have some insight too, so we should talk.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:13]** When you're ready, you want to come up to the bridge?

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** I'd prefer you come to us.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** Sure, that's fine.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** I mean, I'm here with Narla.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:23]** Narla also would like to talk to you, so if you would like, you can come.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:23]** It's up to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** I prefer you come alone.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** All right.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Okay.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** Interesting.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:30]** Interesting choice, Rick.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** All right.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** I'm going to sit back on the bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:35]** Smack him down and take him into hypnosis.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** She sits next to Dr. Okay.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** I'm ready when you are calling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** All right.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:43]** Here we go.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:43]** Yeah.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** Okay.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:50]** Natural 20 for a 28.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:52]** Nice.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:56]** So Colin starts swinging the locket back and forth.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** All right, here's focus.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Focus on the locket.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:05]** You see it swinging back and forth.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:15]** As you swing back and forth, you feel the sensation of walking through a forest and the swinging of the locket.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:19]** As your weight shifting from foot to foot,

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:26]** As you walk through the forest, you see a tree, a tree with a hollow in it.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** You step over to the hollow.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:36]** Inside the hollow, what do you find?

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:41]** You find your memories from the last 24 hours.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:46]** Here's what you find.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:51]** Here's you reach in to that hollow.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** And the memories.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** You realize they're little bugs.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** And they start.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:00]** These little crickets.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:02]** This whole swarm comes out.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:04]** And takes over your entire body.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:06]** And you are in the hangar.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Talking.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:10]** To Rolu.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** And you're sleeping.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:15]** And you are confident this is a dream.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:19]** And you are happy to see Rolu, the excitement.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** But you can't hear anything.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:24]** Rolu's mouth is talking and you can't hear anything.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:30]** And then suddenly it's like something is reaching inside of you and pulling you away from Rolu.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:32]** And you are being pulled back.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:34]** And everything around you stretches.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** And you sit up.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** And you feel that same pull.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:47]** to put your feet on the floor and look straight ahead at the empty bed across from you.

**[00:37:49 - 00:38:02]** And then, shh, Rick19 walks in, nothing in their eyes, and they sit down across from you and look at you.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:07]** You are moving through the drift.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:17]** You are lying on the bed and vividly, crisply remember the cool feeling of the metal beneath your skin.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:22]** You realize you're not wearing anything.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:30]** Your whole body feels cold as you shiver and you remember the air touching you.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:59]** condensing on you and you can't move anything your eyes start to look wildly around and you feel and see this tray next to you as you you in your mind you can sense that there's there's anger around you and then there's a cold still deep abyss of nothingness permeating the emotional fields around you

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:06]** There's a deep pain in your antennae, and I need you to make a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** Will save.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:09]** Will save.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:09]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** All right.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:13]** Rolling.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:14]** Rolling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** Rolling, rolling.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:20]** Sorry, I thought my particularly high hypnosis check would work, but... Sorry.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:20]** All good.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:21]** It's an 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** You almost white out from the pain.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:31]** But for a brief second, you're able to sit up.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:36]** And you realize that you're not actually sitting up.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:42]** It's almost like your body is trying to move itself and will itself physically to sit up.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:56]** But it's almost like you have this sight in your mind and you can see multiple of the

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** Experimenting.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Plunging.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** Snipping.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:03]** Sewing.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:05]** Shaving.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:11]** Poor Kelly.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** And most importantly, cutting.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:24]** And what you do see, as your mind wants to sit you back down, is Tor of Grey Crag.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:29]** Walking, following a gray out of the room.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** And you're out.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:33]** You wake back up and open your eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:39]** This is what the adventure calls for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:44]** This feels like a really specific version of hell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:58]** It's more of a question from Kelly, but the way that Torv was following the Grey, would he know that it was voluntarily or intentionally?

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:02]** Or did he look like he was hypnotized and under control?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:04]** Hypnotized and under the same control.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:12]** You got some more memories, I think, just from your higher check, from the consistent check that Benny was able to pull you into a deeper sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:16]** Well, I saw...

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:24]** Every one of you and everyone on the Void Crier on beds getting experimented on by multiple greys.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:27]** I saw their entire bodies.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:29]** They were greys for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** You said multiple greys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:33]** Yes.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:37]** Like a lab full of them.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** Maybe half a dozen.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** You think... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:45]** If you had...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:45]** Yes, John.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:51]** I was just going to say, because Colin got a 20, which is just really good.

**[00:41:53 - 00:42:02]** If you were to guess, I would say that probably, I would say there's probably four grids.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** That were moving around the space.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:08]** Four, four, four-ish grays.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** Yeah, tough to tell.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:13]** They took part of my antenna.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:16]** I don't think I can grow that back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:21]** I now want to just like hypnotize everybody on board just to hear the stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:36]** I think too, like to convince that if there's ever a need of convincing somebody that we've been adopted by grace, then we should, we should probably hypnotize some more so that we're all on the same page.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** That's a good point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** I I'll, uh, I'll keep my luck at handy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:44]** I have asked Shay to come back here alone.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:46]** I think we should reveal to him first.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:49]** And if he would like, I think we should offer to hypnotize him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:50]** Yes.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** Let's see what happens.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:53]** Where's he coming down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:55]** Where?

**[00:42:55 - 00:43:01]** From the elevator?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** Colin steps over to the elevator.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:05]** Colin is waiting in the elevator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:13]** You see the, and hear first, the elevator coming down.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:19]** And then, and Shay Dysha steps out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Hey, Colin.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** How are you feeling?

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:27]** Seems like there was some, did Rick tell you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:28]** He told me.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:32]** So did Hirsch and Dr.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** O.K., if you can believe it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Rick told them.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:37]** Okay.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** I mean, I told Rick to tell them.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** So, yeah, I'm glad that you're briefed.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:41]** All right.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** Where are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:46]** What did you find out from the bridge?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:49]** Let me tell all of y'all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** I shut the door.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** I can't reopen it.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** You should reopen it.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:54]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:58]** So all six of us cried out to this, like, ten-foot room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** And then in Foundry, you all shut the door.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:06]** So you shut the door on Shay right as Shay walks up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:06]** Gotcha.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:07]** Hey.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** All right.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:12]** This is f***ing weird.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** I'm just gonna say it.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** This is...

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:22]** This is f***ing odd, and I think I might know who is behind this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:25]** What did you find, Shiz?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** I've been talking to Narla.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:39]** Turns out that our computer is also missing the 24 hours.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:50]** But some fragmented sensor data shows that it happened around 11.32.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:51 - 00:45:03]** And it seems to be that there was an EMP that hit the Void Crier.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:09]** And Shay shows you, hands you a data pad showing this loss.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:12]** Does anybody want to take and look at the data pad?

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Who does he hit it to first?

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** He just holds it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:19]** Of course we'll look at this.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:25]** Is it obvious what the information displays or do we need to be a computer specialist or something to make it out?

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** Or an engineer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:29]** There's an opportunity here for somebody to make a computers check.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** I'll make a computers check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** I'll assist.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:35]** I have a really high role.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:38]** I mean, I have a really high modifier, but it's only 15 total, unfortunately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** Can I aid with that?

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:46]** I have a plus 12 computer, so I automatically assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Oh, wow.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Hold on.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:51]** Let me see if I assist as well.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:52]** I think I do.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** A seven plus a six is a pass, right?

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** Seven plus a six is a pass.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:56]** Yes.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:57]** I also assist.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** Wait.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Push the green button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** Kevin, you turn up the brightness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:06]** If you sort by date.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** See that?

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:09]** See that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** Sort by date.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:14]** What?

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:22]** Dr. Okay is like, there's an issue with your if function in your search if you're going to go through and look at this.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:24]** You missed something in the syntax.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** Yeah, there's a semicolon here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:28]** Does Colin help as well, or Ken?

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:31]** Colin doesn't know shit about computers.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** It's a 19 in total, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** A 19 in total.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:44]** It seems like you can tell from the censored positional data where the sensors are located that

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:50]** A higher check would give you more specificity, so maybe you can use a different computer.

**[00:46:50 - 00:47:04]** But you are able to tell that the EMP originated from somewhere, if you think of the Void Crier, it originated somewhere in the back half.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:08]** You don't know if that's back left, back right, you're not sure.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** But somewhere...

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** in that back half.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** What are you laughing at, Benny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** What's up?

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** TLDR sucks to suck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** Sucks to suck.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:19]** But you can tell more of where that EMP originated from.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:21]** The other thing is this.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:21]** Yeah, what's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** Are you saying the EMP was on board?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:28]** It came from inside the ship, not outside, but targeting the back of the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:29]** It came from outside the ship.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** Okay.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:36]** But in the direction of somewhere in the like 180 degrees of the back hemisphere of the ship.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:40]** It came from outside of the ship from behind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:42]** From above, below, left, right.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** You're not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:46]** It came from behind.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:49]** I would be more nervous if it was inside the ship already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:55]** Go ahead.

**[00:47:55 - 00:48:01]** The EMP pulse came from outside of the ship, but it targeted somewhere at the back.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** Maybe the engines.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** I don't know.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Did you check?

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:08]** There's no ships around us right now, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:38]** well so here's the thing oh okay that emp hit us and we're still restoring that's the only sensor data that we have we don't have anything right now we're not seeing anything right but i think i can probably with this information you tell me through the back half i think we can work wait sorry what what doctor okay well i mean do you believe in hypnosis whoa what what


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:43]** Listen, something maybe in the back half of your brain may be locked.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:48]** We would like the opportunity to help you see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:50]** I will say I have already undergone this.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** You won't be the first, but I think it will reveal to you something.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:56]** And we can then share with you what we've seen.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** I promise you it is safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:02]** How did we go from talking about the CMP and the ship to hypnosis?

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** That was a big leap.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** You'll see why.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** I understand for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:16]** If you don't mind, gentlemen, there appears to be 24 hours missing from everybody's communities.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** No shit.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:17]** Mine included.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:30]** There was a show on, I remember from Akaton before I was sort of appeared where you found me on that asteroid.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:37]** And it talked about hypnosis as a way to recover memories.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:59]** I believed it about as much as you did right now until I used it on these three and he gestures to the other three members of our cast this is a I mean it's a long shot but if you're willing to give it a shot it'll only take a few minutes of your time yeah alright


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:04]** You know, I never thought I'd say this, but that's not the weirdest thing that I've heard today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:09]** So... Not the weirdest thing I've heard today.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** I know how you feel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** Right?

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:11]** Yeah.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** All right.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** We've all seen some weird shit.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** I'm in good company then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Okay.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:17]** Have a seat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:18]** All right.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:20]** Can I share something with you real quick?

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** Well, I'll tell you after.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:22]** It's fine.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:23]** Rick.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:24]** Yeah.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:26]** What were you going to say?

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** Maybe it's good now, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** This may be important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** Have you all looked outside?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** No.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:34]** No?

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** No.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** Okay.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:38]** Do we have, like, windows on this floor?

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** Not on this floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** They're kind of temporary.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:43]** All right.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** I'll spoil the surprise.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** We haven't moved.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:53]** So wherever we were 24 hours ago, we are at the same spot in the drift.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:56]** And... Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:00]** This is a question for John from Kevin.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:02]** John doesn't exist.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:03]** I'm only shit.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** Forever and ever.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:10]** The stewards knew about the greys, right?

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Sorry.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** I took it too far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** I just thought of fucking Ghostbusters.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** There is Zool.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** What's her name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:20]** I'm the gatekeeper.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** You are the key master.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:23]** I am the gatekeeper.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** Yeah, key master.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** All right, Kev.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:27]** The peaceful transition of power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:32]** So the stewards were aware of the greys, or did they just come to Omicron?

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Is it Omicron or Mega?

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** I don't remember.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:36]** Or Omicron.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** Omicron.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:37]** That was Omicron.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** Yeah, did they just come to Outpost Omicron, or they were aware of the greys?

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:44]** You got a sense that they were aware of the greys, yeah.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:54]** Okay, so he's going to just say to Shay, he's going to be like, Shay, you are aware that the Outpost that you recovered us from was controlled by the greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:59]** They are capable of doing everything that we've just discussed.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:03]** The hypnosis will just show you, hopefully...

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:08]** Though it might be jarring and traumatizing, especially if you're Kelly.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:12]** Yeah.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:12]** All right.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:43]** who's kelly all right so uh all right what do i do uh yeah i don't know who kelly is uh yeah weirdly i don't like people named kelly so i actually think everyone named kelly should just get go to a planet called kelly and just live their kelly lives yeah all 10 of us all 10 of us yeah they're yeah they're only 10 of the whole freaking pack worlds all right shay come come come on all right focus all right focus on this yeah yeah all right

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:45]** All right, what do I do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:48]** That's only a six on the die for a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** 14, okay.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:53]** I don't know what that means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** That's fine.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** Colin swings the locket.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Focus on the locket.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** Both eyes.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:06]** And Colin is paying special attention to the digital eye to see if it changes color.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** Digital eye?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** Shay's not the one with the eye.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** That's Torv.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** That's Torv.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:10]** Sorry.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Sorry.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:11]** My bad.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** We'll get to him.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** Side dwarf.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** He swings the locket.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** We'll finish him.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:20]** Swings the locket back and forth.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:20]** Yeah.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** All right.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:22]** He says, all right.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:23]** Focus.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** Focus on the locket.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:27]** Focus on the locket.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:27]** All right.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:32]** As you see it swinging back and forth and back and forth.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** Yeah.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:37]** You feel as though you're a bird flying through the air.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:43]** Each swing of the locket is a pulse of your wings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** I don't have wings, but thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** Anthropomorphic wings.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** Okay.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:50]** All right.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** All right.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:55]** And as you see this locket swinging, you're approaching your nest.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:04]** In your nest, you see your memories from the last 24 hours.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** What is it you find, She?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:18]** I... I'm sitting.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:46]** in John just turned his lights off let's go I'm sitting in the galley oh yeah oh man the red sonics are just gonna get creamed they're gonna lose and then wow this is nice this is nice I like this this is it's good to have a break

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:54]** And I feel like, oh, now I'm, whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** Now I'm walking.

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:00]** Okay.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:00]** I don't remember.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** Okay.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:05]** And now I'm in the elevator.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:09]** And there's a, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** I want to go to my room.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** I have to.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:19]** So I... Okay, so I'm walking, and oh, I'm on my bed now.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:23]** My feet are on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:28]** I'm looking ahead like I'm... Like I'm supposed to.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:33]** And I'm... I'm moving.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:42]** Oh, and now I'm... Now I'm laying on the... On a table?

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:42]** Table?

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:47]** And there's... There's a... There's a sound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:54]** And... It's... It's... It's deep.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:57]** And it's cold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:06]** And... It's telling me... To close my eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:10]** And to never... Never open them.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** No, Colin, stop!

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** Stop, Colin!

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:12]** Colin!

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** Colin!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:15]** Let him out.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:15]** Let him out.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** Do you see what we mean?

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:26]** What the f*** was that?

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** That was Grey's shit.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:32]** Some of us saw it a bit more intently, but you know that's what they do.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** You know from all the stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:42]** Some of us, in our visions and our memories, we saw all of their eyes, their form.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:47]** There were four of them experimenting on everyone on this ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** Shay, this is very important.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:50]** Yeah.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:52]** What did you see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:56]** All I saw were the inside of my eyes.

**[00:56:56 - 00:57:00]** I was told to keep them closed forever.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** And it was dark.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:08]** And there was no way that I could open them.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** Forever?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** That's what they wanted.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:15]** There was a voice in my head.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:18]** I couldn't see anyone.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** I couldn't touch anyone.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** I was going to have no senses.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:30]** Be in no contact with anyone forever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:35]** It felt like a punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:41]** Shay, this... We know this is the Greys.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:47]** I... I am concerned that there might be somebody involved.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:56]** I'm not sure, but I can't rule it out that someone aboard the ship might be involved with them.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** Shay... Is it possible?


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:59 - 00:57:59]** I don't...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:12]** That seems, that seems wild considering that we all just fought against them and some of Pike's, some of the Pikes died.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:15]** That's a big stretch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** Shay.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** Yeah.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** This may be a strange question.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:24]** Do you have any inexplicable wounds?

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:24]** Not strange.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** Or soreness?

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:28]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** No, I don't have any.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:32]** Or incisions?

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:32]** No.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** Anything like that?

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:34]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:34]** Nothing.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** You don't feel sore anywhere?


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:37]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:42]** I feel fresh as a spring castor belt chicken.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:45]** Can we have Dr. Roque inspect your body?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:46]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** Do I need to disrupt?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:53]** Turn your head and cut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** Do you want me to roll medicine?

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** Yeah.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:05]** That was a 18 on the die plus 13.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** 31.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** Yeah, there's nothing.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:12]** Body seems fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:18]** Shay, could we perhaps take a look at Meltaman's logs?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** Yeah, that's a great idea.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** Yeah, let's do that.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** Let's do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:36]** I just, sorry, I'm just thinking this through, and if it's just the greys attacking us, there's nothing we can do.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:43]** They EMP the ship, they take us all, but there's definitely a way forward going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:45]** I mean, there's an EMP shielding, isn't there?

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:48]** Could we do a physical science for that?

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:51]** Could we do a Faraday cage around us for the next 24 hours?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:53]** Somebody give me an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:56]** Engineering.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:56]** I got it.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** And you're asking about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:59 - 00:59:59]** Okay.

**[00:59:59 - 00:59:59]** 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:03]** I got a... I got 17 to assist you.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:05]** 27 to assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** 27 to assist.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** 29, so like 33.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:08]** Great.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** Dr.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:14]** O.K., the fact that we have not moved for 24 hours... Hours.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** Hours.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Hours.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:19]** Seems...

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:41]** suspicious to you that fact is hanging in your head why would all this happen and yet we still haven't moved and it's been maybe an hour maybe 45 minutes to an hour since you all woke up so hang on clarifying question so like that 24 hour period we didn't move we still haven't moved you still haven't


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** Got it.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:45]** We moved and then stopped, right?

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:50]** We didn't stop near... Have we moved on from the asteroid where it imploded?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:52]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:54]** You're already in the drift.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:56]** You've been going in the drift.

**[01:00:56 - 01:01:02]** What I'm saying is that from 11.32 yesterday to 11.32 today, you didn't move and you still haven't moved.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:02]** Dr.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:07]** O.K., you recall that there is...

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:25]** a device, part of a system called a drift shadow projector that reduces an engine's drift drive capabilities by two.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:32]** And you can effectively cripple ships and their ability to enter, exit, or navigate in the drift.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:44]** But here's the thing, is that the device is only effective within 10 hexes of the ship that it's trying to affect.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:44]** Yeah.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:52 - 01:02:02]** If we're back in a f***ing simulation, I'm so mad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:09]** It was all a dream.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:13]** Oh my god.
