**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:39]** All right.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Enough said.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:41]** Fair enough.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** I mean, if people... I mean, yeah.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** It suits you to go to El Guapo, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** You're good.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** Was it just like a regular margarita?

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** We dined like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** Lauren got the classic margarita.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:59]** I got a raspberry margarita and a pineapple margarita, which the raspberry one was very good.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** The pineapple one was also good, but it was too pineapple-y for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** Have you ever had a tamarind margarita?

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** Yeah.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** It's freaking good.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:12]** So there's a spot here called One Night Taco Stand, and they do...

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:20]** They do tamarind margaritas, but they give you a straw that's covered in tamarindo, and it's dusted with tahini.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** Oh, wow.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:25]** And so you've got your margarita, and you get a little snack.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** Oh, sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** And it's really tasty.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** That sounds real good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:32]** Well, up to the 904, we'll all have some spicy marks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** I love spicy marks.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:43]** It's not margarita-related, but we went to an herb festival recently, and there was somebody that had... Wait, what?

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Herb festival?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:49]** Is this a festival celebrating individuals named herb?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** Herb garden?

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** Herbs?

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** Herb festival?

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:57]** No, it was a festival celebrating spring and gardens.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:59]** So it's a Wiccan festival.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** No, there was no... Maybe.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** I didn't... I don't know.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** It's an undercover Wiccan festival.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:09]** Was there any people wearing kilts who shouldn't be wearing kilts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:14]** There were a couple of people that we felt came straight from the Wiccan festival or were on their way to the Wiccan festival.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** That's what I was going to ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** You were at a Wiccan festival.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** You were definitely at a Wiccan festival, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:26]** Most people were wearing the 2024 Herb Festival shirt or had their children...

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:30]** Anyways, all I was saying is we went there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:33]** I just stumbled into this ring of rocks and then I blacked out.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** I don't know what happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:36]** It's wild.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:44]** There was a lemonade stand and Lauren got... It was literally a lemon cut in half and then they put a peppermint stick in it as a straw.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:45]** And that's it.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:48]** And I was like, okay, not my thing.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** She loves it.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:50]** It's...

**[00:04:50 - 00:05:12]** it's kind of a big deal i guess wait peppermint lemonade so like but like peppermint sticks are solid so like as a straw i don't know this peppermint stick had a hole in the middle of it oh okay yeah okay uh that's cool and after about 20 minutes the peppermint stick was completely melted away at the bottom she like she's like i lost suction pulled it out and it was just like yeah

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:16]** God, because the acidity of the lemon just ate away at all the sugars.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:17]** It sounds really delicious.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** That's a tough sell.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** It's a hard sell.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** I don't know.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:30]** Look, I always have a beef with mint because it feels tough that I'm supposed to like the same flavor that I like have in my ice cream that I also have in my toothpaste.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** It's tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:58]** it just we could change toothpaste you know charcoal toothpaste right we get you fruit flavor bubblegum flavor i mean there's a whole world of grayson has like a banana something flavor and i'm like this is gross this is not but it's like kid friendly you know yeah i got a sample of like rainbow sherbert like clear sparkly toothpaste and it tastes awful


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** That sounds like it tastes awful.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** Clear, sparkly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:06]** That was cool.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:11]** Where do you guys fall on the mint versus fruit chewing gum spectrum?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** I'm a mint chewing gum.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:16]** I'm a mint chewing gum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:24]** Am I chewing gum in order to talk to somebody to appear non-inabriated or to cover up my breath?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:28]** That's a really specific reason to chew gum.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:28]** Or


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:34]** Or am I in line and I just want 30 seconds of flavor and then that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:38]** If it doesn't have a zebra on it, I ain't touching it.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:40]** Dude, the zebra lasts for like three seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** That's why they give you a whole pack of 20.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** You just have to keep shoving them in your mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** It's fucking gone in like 20 minutes though.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** It's a stick a minute.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:47]** It's horrible.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** It's so sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:54]** I think we may have to get five of those fat packs and just chew the entire pack at once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** All at once.

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:00]** It'll be three seconds total if you just chew the whole thing at once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:06]** But the intensity of the flavor is like three to the 27th power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:30]** they're really juicy for a second it's good i i only chew really uh pop rocks bubble gum pop is a bubble gum which turns wow that turns into bubble gum yeah oh oh that's oh i know what you're talking about i think it's pretty good is this like the the nth iteration of razzles what's a razzle what's a what's that what the heck's a razzle you're gonna hit him with your razzle dazzle


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:52]** okay so razzles are like these discs they're like chalky candy but as you chew the like you're selling sweet tart textures but as you chew it it it turns into gum have you guys never had these are like oh i've seen those those are gross there's razzles normal razzles are gross sour razzles are are decent all


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** Alright, I can see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** I'm trying to look it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:55 - 00:08:02]** I'm pretty sure that Pop Rocks are the progenitor of this by leaps and bounds.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:05]** I think Pop Rocks have been around since the 60s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:11]** I think I've had this Pop Rocks gum, but it's weird because as you chew it, it's still popping in your mouth, right?

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:14]** It's not like it wears off quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:16]** It looked like Honeycomb.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:16]** Yeah.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** Honeycomb cereal.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:22]** That's the only reason I want it.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** I like Honeycomb cereal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:27]** Razzles, I'm going to give you nine years.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:31]** Are you taking nine years plus or nine years minus?

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** Razzles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** What's this handshake bet?

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:35]** 73.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:37]** How much money is on the line?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:41]** We're betting 18 Razzles.

**[00:08:41 - 00:09:03]** okay i'm gonna say are we gonna say pop rocks are first or razzles are first i'm gonna say pop rocks are first the way you phrase that i'm gonna say razzles are first yeah i'm gonna say that too because yeah it sounds like an old name for razzles nine years older than pop rocks not not according to what i just pulled up on google

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** Continue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:12]** William A. Mitchell, a food chemist at General Foods, accidentally invented Pop Rocks in 1956.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** But did not go to market until 1975.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** But it was still the progenitor.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:25]** So, like, if Razzles... If a candy doesn't go to market, it's not a candy yet.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:25]** Fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:27]** What about the other?

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:29]** I could be wrong.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** This is a debate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:41]** You could argue that the invention of candy is probably a small community in which they all talk to each other.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:44]** So who can say, really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Right.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:48]** And we know that Razzles went to market in 1966.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** We don't know how long before that they were created.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:51 - 00:10:00]** Well, it says here the inventor Robert C. Butcher invented Razzles in 1963 and patented candy that was both gum and candy that year.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** So you can see the patent for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:07]** So it was patented in 1963 when were Pop Rocks patented?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:11]** So now we're going by patented.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:28]** uh pop rocks patented in 61 this is an interesting like gray area it is a gray area what they were contemporaries i think we could probably agree on that yeah speaking of uh you know what mr pibb uh-huh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:31]** I don't know how many people are aware, but it's actually Pib Extra now.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:35]** And I bought a Pib Extra when we were at a restaurant.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:39]** And we were sitting there eating, and I was drinking my Pib Extra.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** Are you a convert?

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** No, I put Pib above Extra.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** Or I put Pib above Dr. Pepper.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** I'll always claim that.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** Really?

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:50]** What?

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** Wow.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** This is new information.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** Pib is just very rare and hard to find.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:57]** Anyways, just order it online.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** No, that's weird.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** So, Pib Extra.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:03]** Somebody noticed my Pib Extra and was like, when did it become Pib Extra?

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** And I googled it, and it became Pib Extra.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** It changed from Mr. Pib to Pib Extra in 2001.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:12]** We've just been calling it Mr. Pib, and they didn't market it correctly.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:15]** Or they didn't need to market it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** Maybe Pib Extra wasn't extra enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:16]** They were stealthy.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:19]** They were stealthy about it.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** You know who else is stealthy?

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** Yeah, Dr. Okay.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:23]** Rick19.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:24]** Here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:28]** Dr. Okay is the least stealthy of them all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** Yeah, I'm not.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** I have a plus five to my stealth stat.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:36]** You were... I have to... Nice try, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** Hey, you know what?

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:42]** That's better than... Let's do a sleight of hand roll on that one.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:46]** Yeah, well, I could do it using my new... My sleight of hand's pretty good.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:50]** My new sweet rolling d20 die that you got me.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:53]** If your sleight of hand's really good, you should come up with a transition then.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:56]** My sleight of hand...

**[00:11:56 - 00:12:01]** Dude, I rolled a 16, so you all have to be really impressed, because I just nailed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** That's a middling roll, John.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:10]** You've got really high sleight of hand, but you just... A 16 is the definition of, like, could pass or couldn't, and I feel like... That's literally not what that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:12]** No, it's literally... No, what?

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:12]** No.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:14]** It's a DC 22, John.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** On the die.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** You didn't set the DC against me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:17]** Okay, what is this?

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** A frickin' fool pen and teller here?

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:23]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:26]** We're level five now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:34]** Let's all support John because he does hard work and not every transition has to be perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:39]** John's been refining his sleight of hand since the second grade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:41]** Did you do magic too?

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** I did a bunch of magic.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** I killed.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** I literally killed a kid.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** Really?

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** You killed a kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** He just made a kid disappear and he never came back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:55]** Source was the kid he killed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** I just left a source.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:57]** It was me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:02]** Was John Swan the kid that you killed, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:04]** And then I took his identity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:04]** Yes.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** He's the gray.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:07]** Oh, my God.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:09]** It's been me this whole time.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:09]** Of course.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** It's been me this whole time.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:13]** At the end of the UFC, he just takes off his face.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** I can't.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:19]** The real transition was being able to tell you all that I was the gray in a very funny way.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** And now you all wonder if it was real or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** He just pulls his face off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** Yeah.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** Yeah.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** All right.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:26]** Let's play.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** Look, last time you all were like, hey, you know what?

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** Let's get together in the cafeteria.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** Well, really, it was Kaniko.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** It was like, hey, I want to talk to you guys.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** And Colin was like, it's a date.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:39]** Everyone else was like, it's not.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** It's not a date.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Wait, what?

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** What did Colin say?

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** Oh, date.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:45]** It's a date.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** It's a date.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** It was not a date.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:55]** And as you're in there discussing the intricate details of this plan, Inspector Joxford comes in, starts talking.

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:01]** dissuading you from re-entering the restricted area, saying, I didn't think I would have to come down here twice.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:05]** And then at the end, he's like, by the way, you should come to my party tomorrow.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** Don't make me turn this car around.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Don't make me turn this car around.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** Pull over.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:27]** You decide, and I want to make sure we're clear here, you decided with Kaniko that you're going to explore the restricted area tonight, mostly searching, I think, to confirm, one, details of the vehicles in a garage, because you're discussing like...

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** Do we go to Terrapin?

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Do we need to like, how do we get out?

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:34]** That part seems unclear about what's going to happen at the execution.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** Tonight is the kind of like, hey, we know there's a garage.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** We know there are some other rooms.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:41]** Maybe let's just get some more information, right?

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** But tomorrow's the execution.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:45]** Tonight's like, let's just get in there and see.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** Immediately.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** You're like, fuck it, let's go.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** It's like 5.30.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:51]** You're like, let's go.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Let's just not wait.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** Let's go right now.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:56]** You go.

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:00]** You open the western door to the warehouse.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** And unfortunately...

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:21]** miss that that should set off an alarm or at least let them know it connects to you know there's there's a control that flips a switch that says hey this door has been opened and that goes off somewhere

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** You think, but nothing happens.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** You just show for a second.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:36]** You're out there under the pretense that some of the paratons are going to show some of you, AKA Colin and Dr. Okay, the ship while Rick hears and Kaniko are going to sneak in.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:39]** You're in the warehouse.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:55]** Looking around, it's stuffed to the brim with all these luxury items, these really nice things, jars, cans, various pieces of furniture, you know, like all these nice electronic equipment that you're like, this is really...

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:55]** It's weird.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** Just weird.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** Will, question.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** Don't forget the fox, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:00]** Yeah, I was getting there.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:03]** You mean nice jars?

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:03]** I'm sorry.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** I didn't mean to take that.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** What is a nice jar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** Jars of, like, candied food.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:19]** Just things that seem odd to be at a, you know, military high-end secret base run by a very...

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:22]** clear-cut, militaristic organization.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:25]** Are there Marimarro beans?

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** Is there a jar of beans?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:32]** There's one jar with an unknown amount of Marimarro beans in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:40]** Colin's just walking along, dragging his finger along the jars, and then he stops and he pushes one, and in the back there's a dusty can.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** Dusty jar of Marimarro beans.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:46]** Dr. OK, you also noticed this.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** I don't know what else to call it.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:53]** It's like a like an exotic good.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:57]** It's larval fox.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:02]** They're like preserved in a semi slumber state.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:04]** Excuse me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:07]** And if you were saying like, yeah, people eat them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:08]** Yeah.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:19]** They'll they'll they'll open up the jar and then stab it and it'll like squirm and then they'll eat it.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:20]** Live.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:25]** So they can feel it wriggle down their throat and into their stomach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:27]** It's mostly gross because it's Kapox.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** Kapox are gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** It's just eating them raw.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:31]** It just gave me... It did, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** It's just PTSD.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:34]** You know, different cultures, Kevin.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:37]** I mean... You guys have all tasted Kapox.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:40]** I don't ever want to think about Kapox again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** It tastes terrible.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:41]** Yeah.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:41]** It's disgusting.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:46]** I've never eaten alive food, but I know people that do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Yeah, same.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Yeah, same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** But, like, Vesk, eat them, Yosokis.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** Also, some people don't.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** Some people have the same opinion.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** It's like, that's a little weird.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:01]** Like, you... It is designed to wake up and experience pain and then be eaten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:04]** God damn, that's messed up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:04]** Yikes.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** And then...

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:22]** I believe Dr. O'Kay and Bernice and Hears do a great job of determining that at the second entrance on the eastern side of the warehouse, you disable the alarm and you're able to unlock the door.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** Great job.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** Nailed it.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:29]** Level 5 skill check's coming in handy.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Because as you open it...

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:34]** We'll bring you guys back to the map.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:37]** There's a sense that Rick, Dr.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:49]** O.K., and Colin, you get this sense over you that something is calling in your soul.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:53]** Your heart, it's not like a plea for help.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:55]** It's just like a connection.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:58]** It's like you see something good that needs to happen.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:02]** And you're like, ah, I feel it.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:08]** It's coming down from the left of this double door that has opened up.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** And you all are back.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:18]** You're infiltrating the restricted area of the steward's base.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** Tensions are a little high.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** You're going in.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:23]** Kaniko says, I will lead.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** After talking with Hears.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:31]** And as the door opens, you see Kaniko, too.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:34]** Face suddenly taken aback.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:36]** And she looks at you, Hears.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:39]** And Rick is like, deal with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:55]** she's like what is that do you feel that too that like that calling can i roll mysticism on this yeah sure sure i flip again


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** Do I perceive anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** I didn't perceive shit.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** I had a full or total mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:04]** It was Rick, Dr. Okay, and Colin.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** Whatever it is, it's not magical.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** You're like whispering quietly because the door's open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** That's as quiet as I can go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** Can I roll mysticism?

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** Yeah.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:15]** Just trying to figure out what it is.


## Speaker_0

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:16]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** 27.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** 27, we're calling.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** Rick, you got a what?

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:24]** Four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:29]** Yeah, Rick's like, I don't know what the f*** that is.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:29]** Dr. K?

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:32]** I'm untrained in mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** Plus two.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:37]** Rick's like, I would feel this in my heart if I had one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:39]** Is there another...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:39 - 00:21:01]** i'm i'm happy to entertain another skill check that you think might be appropriate for how dr okay perception or maybe physical science i don't know but you could try a physical science why not we're we're i feel like we're at the intersection of faith and science yeah yeah uh i got a 28 physical science okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** Yeah, Colin and Dr.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:11]** O.K., this is like a wave that came over you and then subsides.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:15]** And Rick, you also feel it subside.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** It's like it crashed onto you.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:34]** And it's a wave of emotion similar to how you felt when you have been listening to a strong cleric or religious figure speaking.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:37]** And you're identifying with what they're saying.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:42]** You're feeling that goodness, that yearning in your bones.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:43]** Yeah.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:46]** There's something about it that feels good.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:51]** And then it washes, hits you, and then washes away.

**[00:21:51 - 00:22:00]** I'm going to roll a perception check for Kaniko, and here's give me a perception check as well, because the two of them are standing right at the door as it's open.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** And you said this was a cry for help?

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:11]** Yeah, there's sort of a cry for help, and there's sort of an acknowledgement of something good that needs to happen.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:14]** You're like, something isn't right.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:18]** Something like, yeah, I need to do something good.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:21]** It's resonating within you.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:29]** Kaniko got a, on her Percept, which is a wisdom save using my new die.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** She did not do great.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:35]** She got a five, I think, according to this die.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Yeah, it's a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** Here's what you get.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:42]** Here's took some inspiration from his old buddy, Rick.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** Love it.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:44]** Okay.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** Yeah, it's great.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:48]** Yeah, we're very much in the dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:52]** You see right across from you the door to the garage.

**[00:22:53 - 00:23:00]** And Kaniko says, Are we going to the garage?

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:05]** Or are we going to go see what this thing is?

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:05]** Because I...

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** I feel like we need to take action.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:11]** I feel like there's something going on here.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** I felt it.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** But maybe we need to stay focused.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:28]** And right at that time, there's a... And a... As someone walks by and enters a door down the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:31]** What kind of footsteps do they sound like?

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** Horse feet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:36]** That's what it sounded like.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Yeah, is it a horse person?

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:41]** If there's horse people, I'm going to be really excited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** The centaur.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:49]** There's a guy with carrots, with coconuts, banging them together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:52]** No, it just sounded like heavy military boots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** Like steel boots?

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** Or like rubber boots?

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:58]** Just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** military boots.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** You can't really tell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:04]** I mean, it would have been like a clunk clunk or a boom boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** Let's call it a boom boom.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:08]** Okay.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** Thank you for that.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:13]** This is... I feel like the world's a lot more richer now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:16]** Grayson has this book called Toot, and it's fantastic.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** You should all look it up.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:21]** Even if you're a full-grown adult with zero children, you should look this book up.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** It's hilarious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:22]** Okay.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:22]** Go ahead.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** Toot.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** Well...

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:45]** When the said trotter went into the room, did we experience or could we perceive any change in the feeling of goodness, but also cry for help?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:52]** No, that has subsided, and that didn't change when that door opened and, you know, it sounds like they went in or something.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** That didn't change.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:54]** Good question.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Good question.

**[00:24:56 - 00:25:04]** Okay, Kaniko's looking at you here and being like, let me peek out.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:05]** She's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** I didn't hear what you said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:11]** She is going to... She has a plus 15 to stealth.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** She got a 32.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** She's just looking out.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:18]** Are you guys going invisible or what?

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** Yeah, you didn't make her invisible, right?

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** We talked about it.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:22]** She has a plus 15.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:25]** No, because she insisted that I didn't have to do that.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** Well, she was like, save it.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:28]** Like, I'm really good at this.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:57]** she looks out steps into the hallway looks to the right looks to the left doesn't see to the right you know is below you on the map which would lead down to the medical center the reactor room the doctor's quarters and then to the left opens up into the space that rick stepped into it's like this open space and you look and she's like we're good she gives you the all clear if you want to step out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** I have a question for you, John.

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:02]** Are we supposed to see the part that says lift and ladder?

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** Uh, yeah, that's fine.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** Okay.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:04]** Yeah.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** So I don't remember seeing this before.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:09]** That's where you went to see the reactor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:09]** Yeah.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** Yeah.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:11]** Yeah.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** That's not like a spoiler.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** I don't remember lift though.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** Um, okay.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:17]** Yeah.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:19]** Here's so she checked, but did you check both sides?

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** Can you go all up and down the hall?

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:21]** Okay.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:21]** All right.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** I'm coming out.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:26]** Rick is going to step up in their absence to the door.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** He's going to stay in the room, though.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** Okay.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:29]** I can't move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:30]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** Just unpause the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Now I moved.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:34]** Oh, no.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** I moved right on top of here.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:36]** Oh, God.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** Okay.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:42]** You crashed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:44]** Excuse me.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** All right.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** Okay.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:53]** I'm wondering if we check out this feeling.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** It came from somewhere to the north.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:01]** And then she, like, steps past you here, and she looks over.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:08]** And here's, I don't know if you can see, but there's a door probably about 30 feet away from you, directly north of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:14]** Above the door, you can see pretty clearly without a perception check, is this training center.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:18]** Then there's a hallway that goes to the left and a hallway that goes to the right.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:25]** And she turns back and she's like, it's something in the training center or whatever's to the right.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** Like, that's what I felt.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:29]** You felt it too, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Here's...

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** Don't think you did, right?

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:33]** No, you didn't.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** I didn't feel anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** Did anyone else, Rick?

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** Did you feel that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** It was like a wave.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** I felt something.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** I'm not quite sure what it was.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** It felt like it was coming from that direction.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** What did it feel like?

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:52]** It feels like something we shouldn't be involved with and we should focus on the task at hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:55 - 00:28:00]** Well, now that Hears knows about this, it would make sense for him to roll a mysticism check.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** So he will do that.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** It's a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:08]** Not great, but... Yeah, it feels like there's something...

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:17]** I think the mysticism check and the physical science check maybe starts to click for the three of you that rolled it, and that did pretty well on it.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:25]** It's like, you think about this incense that you smelled, and that was Yomidean?

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** Is that how we decided to pronounce it?

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:36]** And you think about this sense that, alright, well, there must be some sort of religious space here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:37]** And...

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:40]** Yeah, it's what's-her-name's quarters then.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** Who?

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** The Yomidean person.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** There's the Flocka.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** Yeah.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:52]** Well, I mean... It's something religious.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:55]** I mean, we're here to explore what's going on, right?

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:57]** Not getting out of here until tomorrow.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** That's the plan, correct?

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** During the ceremony?

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:06]** Okay, so, I mean, that sounds like something we could... We want to know what's going on, don't we, Rick?

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** Don't you think we should investigate it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:11]** I, honestly, I'm a little torn.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:16]** I thought our intentions were to find a way off this base.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** Well, we know the way out.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** It's just, we're just stealing a ship.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** I mean, sorry, as you said, we're borrowing a ship.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** All right.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:25]** But before that, we were going to do some research, remember?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:29]** Just be careful, Hears.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:32]** And Rick kind of tightens up on his rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:33]** Ooh, he's got his rifle out.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** All right.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** We'll be careful.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:39]** All right, we're going to follow, I think, your lead, Keniko.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** Okay.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** You want to take a look at this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Is it clear?

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:48]** So like being Colin or just chilling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** Well, I was going to ask what you're doing.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** I was going to say, you probably hear this.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** I mean, this is all comm shatter.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:57]** So you could talk and I don't know what you're thinking.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:59]** You're going to be running a diversion.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** You're going to be keeping lookout.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** You're going to be trying to play it cool.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:05]** Like what's the, like, these are important roles too.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** And I'm curious what you two are thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:13]** Just our luck, we have open comms going on, so the Vlaka is like, I can hear you.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:13]** And we're like, what?

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:14]** The Vlaka can hear us?

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** The Vlaka can't.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:16]** He can speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** She's deaf.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:21]** She can't hear you.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** Allegedly.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** Allegedly.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** We don't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:48]** uh colin pulls out a deck of cards it's like doctor you okay yeah i mean we could play but i think if we're gonna be in here i don't want to be caught red-handed with terrible cards i don't know with what with with playing cards like what's our excuse for being in here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:58]** I think we were maybe just looking for somewhere private to have a chat over some cards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:58]** Fair enough.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:06]** I think that works, but I'd rather have something a bit more... I don't know.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:18]** That power armor over there seems like we might be interested and could maybe talk our way out of some trouble if we overheard somebody talking about a

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:44]** mod they did to this uh not armor it's like mech right yes for like lifted cargo loader yeah it is cargo lifter powered armor yeah i'd be more inclined to to try something like that in case somebody just walked in here randomly all right all right let's give that a shot the doctor okay thing i love this all right so you are going to go over like a

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:50]** So we're just going to disassemble this loader armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:52]** This could be general nuisance to everyone.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** Just mess with it.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** That's the story of our lives.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** I'll put it back together.

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:07]** You're trying to... You see... As we're disassembling, you see Colin shoving screwdriver where it clearly doesn't go.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:11]** Cracking panels and like...

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** He has no engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:15]** So Dr. K is teaching him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:21]** This is where you put the capacitors.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:24]** This is a beautiful friendship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Yeah, it's good.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** Side note for all of you.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:29]** I forgot to mention.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:34]** If you right-click on your character...

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:40]** And then you click on the little flame in the top left corner of the little icons that come up on your HUD.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** You have a flashlight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:44]** What?

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:46]** It's so random and weird, but I love it.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** Is it going to get dark, John?

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:52]** I'm just saying that you will have that now.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:53]** Yeah, thanks.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** That's not foreboding at all.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:56]** But thanks for letting me know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** It's a personal comms unit.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:00]** It's actually a cool mod called Torch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:27]** for foundry so thanks to the creator of that it's super easy you literally drop it in and it adds a button yeah all these buttons what does this button do what does this button do you remember the duct tape mod for half-life which one was that one so half-life you could either have your flashlight equipped or your weapon oh that's right and that's what shaped the mod yeah was like you duct tape your flashlight it was so good okay yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:49]** okay all right sweet well i'm gonna turn it off for now to avoid yeah yeah yeah you know yeah all right stealth mode what's that floating it's essentially your personal comms unit so it's like your cell phone that you're just using okay we're just like the mystery whatever they're called mystery ink just like you know running around with flashlights blazing love it cool cool okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:54]** It's like a white phosphorus flashlight that illuminates the entire hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** Yeah, it's really bright.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:56]** Really bright.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:58]** All right.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:06]** Keniko looks back and she's like, I don't know if you're going to do invisibility, but we're going to need to cross this open space and they have windows.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:13]** Yeah, there's no one in the space, but there are windows in that command center.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:19]** So we're going to need to be extra sneaky or be invisible.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:23]** I don't know who has better self between here and Rick.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** Well, it's probably not me.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** Rick kills things a lot, so I feel like it's better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:31]** Yeah, but being invisible, you get like plus 40, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:51]** plus 40 if you're not moving plus 20 if you are I think is that what I said yeah everyone shut up I gotta focus alright it's been a while alright alright and he like throws his head back and you just see like from his fingers slowly just pieces of him start to disappear crawls up his body from his toes too and he's invisible now amazing okay

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** Rick, I'm right here.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** Where?

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:53]** Where did you go?

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** I'm breathing on your neck right now.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:59]** Can you feel it?

**[00:34:59 - 00:34:59]** Oh, God.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** All right.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:04]** Rick, I'm right behind you.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:08]** It's kind of funny.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** All right.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:15]** Koneko walks very slowly looking to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:17]** Are you coming with us?

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** I did not intend to come with you.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** I will keep watch from here.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:20]** All right.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** Bye.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:21]** Oh, I thought that she went.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** Interesting.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:24]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** It was too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** You're not fucking.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:26]** Really?

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Rick, we talked about you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** I've said that this entire time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** We definitely talked about a third person coming.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:33]** I know you're just trying to lure me into something, John.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** I'm not.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** We did talk about this.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** Look, it's fine if you guys want to change the plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** Are you just going to leave your pal here as alone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:38]** I'm just saying.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:39]** You're invisible.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:43]** We did talk about this, about a third person coming.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** And I think it was Rick who decided to come.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:47]** So if you want to change the game, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** Stop changing the game.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:50]** What do you mean change the game?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** He's making a choice.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Do you know what that means?

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:59]** That means that John might have calculated that three fucking people were coming and so he made the mobs for three people.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** If you want to change the game, what else would that mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:04]** If you get into a fight, I will step up and kill things for you.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:09]** But there's no reason for me to go clunking around over there and get you guys caught.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:12]** Look, I don't want to die, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:12]** I have your back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:15]** I don't know if we can trust Keniko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:20]** Keniko steps up and keeps walking across the space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** Can we trust your girlfriend?

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** You are never allowed to complain about Thaddeus ever again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:27]** I've never been more glad to be tinkering with machinery.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:30]** Keniko looks around, looks down the hallway.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:37]** The hallway curves to the right and there's a door about 10 feet up and then it curves again going north.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:40]** The door just says, Jock's hurt.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** Inspector Jock's hurt.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:43]** To the right.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** The door that said training center.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:50]** Yeah, that's the tall head of chief of the whole.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** He's the big boy.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** Frithani.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Frithani, that's right.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** The long Kevin, as we say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:57]** Yeah.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:58]** Okay.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:58]** False.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** Kaniko goes.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:06]** She's going to open the door to the training center to see what's in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** Why is Kanika leading this?

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:12]** I mean, here's... It's like John Walkus right into a trap, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:14]** Here's... Here's can do it if here's wants to.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** No, it's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** Okay.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** You do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** Okay.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** I don't want to touch anything.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:19]** Okay.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:19]** All right.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:22]** It's fine.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** She opens the door.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** And here's when she opens the door.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:33]** Oh, my God.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** You see...

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:38]** You see what looks like... Weirdly.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** It looks like a completely different space.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** No.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:47]** It looks like a... I don't like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:47 - 00:38:12]** what what is happening it looks like it's the inside of like a like a medieval tavern yeah it's a it's a midi it's we're in dnd now we're in it's a fucking holodeck this is give me it could be a holodeck give me a perception check yeah it's uh the danger room is that what's it called an x-man yeah the danger room yeah the x all right uh give me a perception check it's a seven


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:38]** okay you you it it it looks very real to you if there's any sort of projection projection or hologram you cannot see but you can see that there's like light streaming in from the right and there's like a nice stone floor really nice woodwork these arched doorways and panels it looks like like it's just like pathfinder times it looks like it is an ancient ancient inn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:38]** Yeah.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** I changed my mind.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** It's pretty cool.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** Actually.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** I kind of want to explore it too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:45]** It's really cool looking as you're about to go in.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:51]** You do hear voices coming from inside and around the corner behind some walls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Hmm.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:53]** All right.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** Here's lessons in, I suppose.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:56 - 00:39:04]** They're just talking for a second and then they slip into a language that you're not quite sure what that is.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:07]** And then the voices start to walk towards you.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** Give me a culture check.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:11]** And it's probably gray language.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** And let's see our culture check.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** It's a 21.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:18]** Kaniko starts to walk over to the right.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:24]** She like shuts the door and starts to walk over to the right and head up around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:32]** Rick is going to pull back into the room as he sees you guys disappear, and he's going to say over the comms, what is happening?

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** I need a situation.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** What is it called?

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Can you give us a sit-rep?

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** Yeah, rep.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:38]** Sit-rep.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:40]** Sit-rep, yeah.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** Sit-rep.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** My brain shorted.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:44]** Wait, what does a culture check do, though?

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** Can I tell what they're saying?

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:48]** You don't think you've ever heard that language in your life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:51]** Could you pipe it through to the comms?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:52]** The door was shut.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:56]** I mean, like... Not now, not in the moment.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** Oh, so they left the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** Do you know the languages I speak, John?

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** Yeah.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:01]** Okay.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** All right.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** Because here's his pretty... He speaks a lot of languages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:10]** He's never seen any of the creatures we've ever run into, but he speaks all of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** But he speaks all of them.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** Literally all of them.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** All right.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:20]** I think the gray was the one that you weren't surprised at.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** You're like, what is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** It's only my worst fear.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:24]** That's fine.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:28]** You wait for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:38]** If you can maybe get closer or get close to them talking again, maybe you could pipe it through the comms.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:38]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:41]** Yeah, we could.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:45]** I feel like I've heard that language before, but I don't know what it is.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** This is Kaniko.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:51]** And then as you're backing up, trying to move away, just in case, there's a door behind you.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** The door is the hallway curved to the north.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** And here's Kaniko.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** You both see that it says chapel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:01]** That's probably where it's coming from.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** Okay, yeah, okay.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:03]** All right.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** Where are you going?

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** Do you need me to follow?


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:07]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:12]** Yeah, we probably, well, no, not now because those, there might be people coming out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** I mean, if you want to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:18]** It's, it's, we're, we're, we're at the chapel, everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:20]** Of course, Koneko's like, yeah, come follow us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:21]** Stand by, stand by.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:23]** Bring everyone.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:25]** Rick, if I go offline for too long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:25]** Rick.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** It's coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** Yeah, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** Copy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** It's fine.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:29]** Rick, do you shut the door?

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** To the warehouse?

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** To the hallway or no?

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** I do not.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:36]** Okay.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:36]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:47]** And Kaniko, here's you look and see that this door probably locked the same as some of the other doors.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** If you're going to want to get in, you're going to need to open it.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** You're going to need to hack it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:54]** Oh, okay.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:56]** Wait, Kaniko, can you do this?

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:56]** What?

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** Do you have access or can you hack it?

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** Wait, speak up.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** I can't hear you.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** It's only six o'clock.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:02]** Okay.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:05]** I said... It's 6.30.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:08]** Do you know how to hack the doors if you have access?

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** No, I don't have either.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:11]** All right, scoot out of the way, please.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** Okay, she moves.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** Do you know anything about computers or engineering?

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:18]** No, no, I don't.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:18]** Nothing?

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** I'm only good with people.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** I'm sorry.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** Okay, it's fine.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:24]** No, shh, shh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Rick, Dr.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:31]** O.K., and Colin, give me an intelligence check.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** Say that again?

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:36]** Give me an intelligence or a wisdom check.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** Whichever one you think is better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:39]** Why the f*** do you need wisdom checks from us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:41]** I got a 23 on my intelligence.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:41]** 23, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** Makes sense for the doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** 18 for Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:45]** 18.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** Colin?

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:47]** Prize from Rick.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:48]** Very good.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** Colin's not very smart.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** JK, JK.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** Rick is a smart guy.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:51]** I just rolled high.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:53]** Oh, that's not bad.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:54]** Nice.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** I think Dr.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:58]** O.K., Dr. O.K.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:01]** especially, and it makes sense that you rolled the highest, and then Kev too.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** You're like, wait a minute.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:10]** I remember that there was like a change of position, guards, at around 7.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** That's when people start moving.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:33]** we got 30 minutes 6 30 and it's 6 30 right now till the shift change rick pushes shut the door on the warehouse and back and backs away from it okay and right as he says he's gonna in the comms tell here's like hold still shift change

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** It's not right now.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** It's in 30 minutes, probably.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** It's 6.30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:39]** When is the ship taking off?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** Between 6.30 and 7.30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** 1900 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:45]** Wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** It's happening now.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:51]** It's going to be happening soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:55]** It's in half an hour, probably.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** Here's what he's doing.

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:00]** He's fooling around with it.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** He got a 22.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:02]** Got it.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:04]** 22.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:05]** Yes.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:14]** As you're trying to go through, you see that 22 is enough to, how do I say this?

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:17]** 22 is enough to see a few things.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:30]** One, 22 is enough to see that you can't open the door unless you want to like try again, or maybe take 10, maybe take 20, maybe burn a little time.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:38]** But you can see that the biometric lock is tied only to one person.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** Chuck's hurt.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** tall motherfucker.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:44]** Yeah, I don't know about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:44]** On the chapel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:50]** The chapel door is only opening for the inspector.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** That's not suspicious at all.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:58]** You know, John, I mean, is it cool if I, because it's another skill that I'm rolling, right?

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Not computers again.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** Could I roll another skill to try to open it?

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** Yeah, you could do engineering instead.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** I did 28 engineering.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Is that enough?

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** It opens.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:07]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** And as you walk in,

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** It's a dark room.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:18]** The air in the hall is warm.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:19]** Stale.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:26]** It smells like that incense smell, but it's been put out.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** And it's just lingered here.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:33]** There are these tall... Kaniko walks in, like wide-eyed.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:38]** Even in the dark, you can see that the room is beautiful.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:47]** There are these tall, multicolored panels of almost like picture-stained glass that's really high up in the nave, right?

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:50]** It's like beautiful artwork.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:55]** You can see, you know, when powered, it would look incredible.

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:02]** Between each of these panels are these little niches, each with an idol in it.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:07]** And at the northern end of the room, there's a few steps up.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** Leads up to a semi-circular dais.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:19]** And there's a plain altar of curved stone and a couple items on the dais.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** A quick look around.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:25]** You think you see idols of Abadar?

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:27]** Demoratosh?

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** Desna?

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** Hylax?

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** Iomideh?

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:45]** Phrasma, Sarenrae, Triune, Weyden, and Yara Esa.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:50]** Here's, give me a... Okay.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** Well, I think you can tell pretty easily that the...

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:58]** The power is out, and it should have come on when the door opened.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:02]** So it must have been tampered with or cut.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** And there's a control panel.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** Oh, so the power should have come on.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:09]** Yeah, there's a control panel on the back wall that you could try and investigate if you wanted to see.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** Here's what is happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:18]** There's... I see... Well, hold on one second.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:18]** Stand by.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:22]** Can you... No, I was going to explain what... Okay, you explain.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** No, no, no.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:23]** You explain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:48]** no no explain can you go no i mean i've been here no i'm seeing do you see this in the corner and she points to this like and now that she points to it i don't see that he's gonna have to walk in hold on all right now i see yeah there's like there's do you see this look closer yeah there's this put your hand inside of it and then close your eyes don't look at me i hold it to your neck and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:56]** An animal caught in a trap would gnaw off its own leg to escape the pain.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:58]** What will you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:00]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** There's something here.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:09]** I don't... This is... It looks like this is the only one that's glowing.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** Is that right?

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** Yeah.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** Which god is this?

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** I don't see any others.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** I think this is Yomato.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:28]** And you look and you see that the idol of Yomide has been completely covered with a piece of cloth.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:31]** Maybe you look around, you see all the other ones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** They have not been.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:37]** Are there Palantir stones in Starfinder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:41]** I don't... I'm not sure what that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:45]** That's a Lord of the Rings reference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** I remember the name.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** Palantir stones.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** The seeing stones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:53]** Give me... Let's do this.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** Here's the situation.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** I've been doing great at those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** Fabricius.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** The situation rolls an eight.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:03]** Okay.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** How's that for the situation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** Call yourself the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** How's that for the situation?

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** I've done that before.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** My cat is biting the light.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** Please don't do that.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** Oh.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** What do you guess?

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:17]** Kaniko.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** I know what happened.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** I saw the planning.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** Do you think we should...

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:38]** hey hey stop it oh man technical difficulties all right technical difficulties um she's here it's okay uh

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** Yeah, so you see a couple things.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:46]** Like I said, there are a couple items up on the dais, and then you see that there's this panel, and you see that there's the cloth.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:56]** And Kaniko's like, I think we should unveil the idol of Nyong'o.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** No?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:02]** Yeah, I'm going to say the most useless thing ever in this game.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:06]** I'm going to roll a sense motive, and then I'm going to roll an 18.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:09]** He's an 18 sense motive.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:09]** She seems genuine.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:11]** She does seem genuine.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:11]** I'm sorry.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:14]** Yeah, I was just getting ahead of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** She does seem genuine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:18]** Why are you guys so paranoid?

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** I don't understand.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** I don't know.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:24]** Just uncover the glowing statue in this dark room in an area that we're not supposed to be in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:30]** I do think that if you were to work on the panel, you could probably restore power to the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** Yeah, that... Okay.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:32]** Right.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** If you want.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** Does Hears think it's a good idea to do that before?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:43]** Like, we... Yeah, if you want to clandestinely go somewhere, make sure you make all kinds of repairs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** Yeah, turn on all the lights.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:47]** Turn on all the lights, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:51]** Leave it better than you found it, okay, Dr. Okay?

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** I could have sworn I cut this cord.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:57]** Where did you jab that screwdriver again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** Meanwhile, Dr. OK.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** Meanwhile, in the storage room.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:13]** OK, so if he rolls the computers or engineering, could he find out if there are other systems that will turn on besides the lights in this room?

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:13]** Sure.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** All right.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** Is either check OK?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:19]** Yeah, I'd say engineering is preferred.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** OK.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:21]** Yeah.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:21]** Right.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:27]** Because you're trying to you would you would want to be investigating all the systems that lead into the panel.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:31]** 26 engineering, he wants to know the scope of what the repair will be.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:37]** You could see that with 26, you could see that you could repair it pretty easily, and it will just restore power to the room.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:38]** It won't do anything else.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:43]** It's not going to send a signal back to... It was DC 20.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** Yeah, that's well over.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:46]** Hey, hey, kid, stop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:50]** Well, he's going to... Okay, before he does that, he's going to ask...

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** Hold on.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:53]** I'll wait for this cat situation to be resolved.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:56]** All right.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** What is he going to do?

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:05]** He wants to, like, he's going to ask Nico first to remove the, um, the, the, whatever it is.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** The shroud.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** Okay.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** Yeah.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** And if you do it.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:09]** Okay.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** It's weird.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** Here's right here.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:15]** Because you can tell that she's like responding to something like she's.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:17]** She's feeling something that you're not feeling.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** And it's really weird.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:24]** But she reaches over and she pulls off the cloth.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** Yours does not look at it, by the way.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:31]** In this idol, it looks like this incredible...

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:34]** Figure of Yomide, who you know was a warrior.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:39]** She's one of the, I believe she's one of the few people who have ascended to godhood.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** She's holding something.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** And you look up, and it's a big idol.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:48]** It's like a, you know, three-quarter size.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** And she's holding a real sword.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** It's a long sword.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** Culture check?

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:57]** You can do a culture or a mysticism check.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:58]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** Oh, okay, Mrs. Susan it is.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** I want to know.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:09]** And when that happens, she's like, this is what we needed to do.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:18]** And Colin and Dr. Okay and Rick, you also... That wave of goodness, it feels like it's been resolved.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:21]** It's like the stormy seas have subsided.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:24]** And something good has happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** Okay, this is good.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:27]** This could be good.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:29]** We could have Yomide on our side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:35]** Maybe we're rescuing some relics from these idols you've described.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** It's beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:41]** Maybe check the others and grab one from Yara Issa for her old doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:46]** If there are any other relics, I'll be sure to check them out.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** He rolled a 29 mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:49]** 29 mysticism.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** So she picked up the sword?

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:53]** No, she just unclothed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:57]** And that gave away the feeling of goodness or whatever you said?

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:59]** Who was the deity?

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** Iomide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Iomide.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:01]** Iomide.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:32]** maybe here as you like walk a little closer and see the the sword itself says for victory for the heart etched onto the blade this is like a really nice sword and metagaming just saying it's a really nice long sword okay all right yeah don't don't don't touch it i'm gonna take it i'm gonna take it sure you put a weight of sand in this place


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:55]** i'm just letting you know like i'm i'm a miss i'm very mystically inclined and i can i okay did you just take it because you just know but no but you just stepped like right on top of her so she was like what are you doing yeah oh no i did it all right uh look uh i need to check to make sure it's it's okay all right because i'm familiar with these kinds of things just let me yeah yeah sure that's fine that's fine okay

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** All right.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** You pick up the sword.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** Hears isn't going to die if he touches it, right?

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** You might.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:04]** Are you picking up the sword?

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:07]** I mean, with his mysticism, he doesn't see anything bad happening, right?

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** It's a pretty high mysticism.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** The sword seems sincere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:17]** Are you just wandering around in the dark about to touch this magical sword?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:17]** Yeah.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** Are you going to turn the lights on?

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** I don't know.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:19]** Okay.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** So hold on.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** He's excited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** He's excited.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** He's excited.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:25]** Let's take it moment by moment.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:25]** Okay.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:27]** He has a 29 mysticism.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:29]** Does he sense that there's a problem?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:36]** You know that Yomide is a very, I think, lawful good person.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:36]** God.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:41]** So it seems odd that there would be a sword here that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:41 - 00:56:11]** would like you know not yeah that yeah that would be evil and retrapped okay here's uh here's is going to reach out and take this order gotta do it it's gotta be done and that's our game that would be so rude i'm throwing caution into the wind for a dope that would be i mean that would be so rude that would be so don't forget the old doctor don't yeah yeah exactly and that's our game cheers

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** No, no, it's okay.
