**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Dude.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** What if our whole show was made into a musical?

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** That'd be rad.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** I just thought about that.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** Yeah.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** Like a lot of singing.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:52]** It's a lot of songs.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** It's a lot of songs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:57]** And then the grace came and took us away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** So like, I'm, I'm thinking about like the.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:03]** Step, step, step on the antenna.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:08]** What if it gets made into a musical, but we never get out of like Hoboken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:11]** Like, it's just like a community theater.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:13]** As far as the musical goes, it's, yeah.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** I'm okay with that.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** Off, off, off, off Broadway.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** Way off Broadway, yeah.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** Way, way off Broadway.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** I'd be down.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:20]** I'd go watch it.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** The Threefold Conspiracy.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** The musical.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** How are we feeling tonight, everybody?

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Feeling good?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:58]** For sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:00]** You know what's even more awkward?

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** Your former in-laws.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:06]** I actually don't know because I haven't done it yet, but I'm not looking forward to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** Wait, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** I think I figured it out.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:11]** You like it when her dad just literally f***ing hates you?

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:19]** That's always... I have a fun story about this.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** Quick check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** Music is there, John.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:22]** Thank you.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:23]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** Continue with your story.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** Nothing.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:35]** It's just when your girlfriend's or boyfriend's dad or whatever hates you instantly, and they never give you a chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** Yeah.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:41]** My ex-girlfriend's dad was a clinically bipolar racist.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:44]** Well, that'll be the reason.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** So, yes, I know exactly what that feels like.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:46]** It's not fun.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** We dated for like five years.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** It was a terrible idea.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:51]** Shouldn't have done it.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:52]** I'm sorry.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** That was a terrible choice.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** I mean, maybe she's grown.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** Did you have fun for five years?

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:59]** I had some fun in those five years.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:03]** I mean, you got to piss off her racist dad, so that's good.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:03]** I did.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** That's a win.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:06]** It was.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:09]** He had to deal with it for five years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** Yeah, that was not my wisest choice.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:14]** I've learned a lot, both from that and since then.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** Cheers to you, Benny.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Cheers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** Cheers to life lessons.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** Drink water because it's healthy for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** Cheers.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:24]** This is how the musical starts, is us being like, cheers to life lessons.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:27]** Wow, this was a great podcast.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:29]** If only I could relive it in a musical form.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:34]** And then it goes back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:37]** And then the musical adventure starts.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:46]** We're all Starfinder characters in a musical reenacting what is going on from our characters.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:49]** Is that what's going to happen next in this fold?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:49]** Yeah.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** I'm looking forward to this.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:53]** I don't want Lin-Manuel Miranda anywhere near it.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** Never.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:54]** Okay.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:58]** I'm just, I, I, I personally think, I think, okay.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:01]** Alexander Hamilton as a figure in history is so cool.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** And I like him a lot.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:05]** And him, him versus Jefferson.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** I agree with Hamilton more on a lot of things.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:10]** If you go like back to the big sort of debate they have.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:13]** But anyway, the musical is way overrated in my opinion.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:19]** Lin-Manuel Miranda cannot second sing for shit.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:22]** Okay, I think he's the worst Hamilton.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** His voice is grating and annoying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** Anthony Ramos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** And the music is not that good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** Oh, come on.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:38]** I will accept your first point because, and this is like, Lin has stated this in multiple interviews and in writing.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:42]** He knew that he was not a strong singer and not a strong vocalist.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:46]** And so he wrote his own musical so that he could sing in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:46 - 00:06:10]** so like i get it i respect it well thanks make your own success i think it's this is not russell crowe singing okay he's yeah who is or huge russell crowe's bad at singing yeah but like i would rather listen to that for sure lid also has flows that you wouldn't imagine yeah it's true dude he's got bars all right look

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:36]** yeah dude not he knows the whole musical isn't him he's been given bars for a long time even in his like guest appearances on house if anyone yeah yep uh the style yeah it's yeah the style is cool i i don't think there's anything wrong with it i just don't think the execution is very good i i i feel like it's for me it's like a musical

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:39]** It's like, yeah, the Hamilton musical.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:39]** I don't know.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** It's just my perspective.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** And apparently I'm wrong.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** I don't know.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:47]** But like, it's just like it seems like an emperor's new clothes thing to me where everyone's like, oh, yeah, it's so good because people say it's good.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:51]** But I just I don't see it at all at all.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:55]** Like, I think it's a criminally overrated like show completely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:58]** Not to change the subject or anything, but did you like Encanto?

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** I haven't seen that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** Do you like musicals?

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:02]** Yeah.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** Do you like music?

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** I like Moana.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** Do your ears work?

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Moana, I don't like that much.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:12]** Like, Les Miserables is fantastic.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:15]** Russell Crowe is not good at singing at it, but at least it was good.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** And then, like, it's a good one.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:21]** Cats has great songs.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** Like, I just don't like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:28]** Sorry, your reference to compare Hamilton is Cats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** Or Les Mis.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** Or Les Mis.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** Cats are way better than Hamilton.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:33]** No.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:34]** Okay.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** Okay.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:39]** Barbara Streisand's version of Memory is an epic song.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** It's a very good song.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:48]** I'm not talking about the new disturbing Cats thing that's weird as f***.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:50]** With James Corden and like, yeah, no, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:58]** The reason I bring up Encanto and Moana is because Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote some of those songs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** That's why it f***ing sucked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:08]** Those are great movies, but I'm looking at his movie list and apparently he was also in Star Wars Rise of Skywalker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:12]** Oh, well, so every shitty movie, basically.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:16]** Okay, that's good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** Can't argue with that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:22]** I don't know what he was in that movie, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** I don't know.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:30]** What undisclosed location is Lin-Manuel Miranda just going to show up at and punk you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:34]** He's going to shoot me because he's Hamilton and he just wants to shoot people in the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:38]** We're just going to add this to your list of celebrities that you've unnecessarily denigrated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** Insulting.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** Absolutely.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** For no reason.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:46]** Which is why you're an expat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** Stay on the west coast, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** That's all I'm saying.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** He's on the west coast of the world.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** He's away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:56]** I'm in the Undying Lands in Lord of the Rings.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** That's where I'm at right now.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** So I can't die.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:02]** So you can't assassinate me, Lin-Manuel Miranda, or find her for that matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:18]** I actually did some reading about that last week, and the Undying Lands for Lord of the Rings, because the rings that were gifted to the elves, or that were forged by the elves, with Sauron and...

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:20]** What's this guy from Shadow of Mordor?

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:28]** We're keeping the elven magic alive in this realm.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:34]** And so with the destruction of the One Ring, the elven rings lost their power and would thus start aging forever.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:43]** And the beauty that was the elven realm, I can't remember what it was called, would start to deteriorate.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:50]** And so they basically gave up their longevity to save Middle-earth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:53]** Oh, well, that might be worth it, I guess, if you, like, care about other people.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** Like, good for the elves, man.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:59]** Much like Pathfinder slash Starfinder takes place in our world.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:04]** Yeah, so, like, apparently lore-wise, the elves were around in the past.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:16]** Have you ever thought, like, as now, I didn't think that I would trade, like, vampirism for eternity, but now I feel like if I had the offer to be a vampire, I would for sure take it.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:18]** Like at this point, I've got that point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:23]** Have you all like you would eat never?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:31]** You know explore I don't I don't I don't yeah, this doesn't yeah will will is fine will be on time That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:42]** Well, it's like I'm not hiking down to the vampires We're in the middle of the night I would just like sneak in and like drink and then like a little bit and then like leave, you know You just suck on people's toes for the rest of eternity.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:42]** I


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:48]** I feel like enough people are into vampires where they would just offer themselves, and I'd be like, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** There's a lot of people that like vampires.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** I worry about you, Kelly.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** I worry about you, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:55 - 00:11:00]** Okay, like, it's okay if I live a mortal life, but until the day that I die, I want to look like 23, okay?

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:03]** No, the vampire thing didn't bother me at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** It was the fact that you don't like anything from Lin-Manuel Miranda.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:07]** I mean, that's the second hottest take you've had today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:08]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:12]** You could always just do blood transfusions anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:18]** You're okay with sucking the life force off of the living for eternity?

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:20]** While listening to cats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:24]** I feel like this is... I feel like you don't have to kill the other person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:54]** you just you know you turn them into yeah well and it this is this is the detail vampire lores like do you do you drink it from the source like do you like if you bite the person you turn them but if they like siphoned it off and you drink it from the tube then you're fine and i mean and also it's true maybe it doesn't like blood for medical reasons that's true it's true yeah uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:54 - 00:12:00]** But I don't think vampires necessarily just need, like, the sustenance.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:06]** I think there is a call to, like, feast upon flesh.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:12]** It's like having a hot meal versus a lunchable, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:15]** I mean, like, you're going to be depressed if you don't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:24]** It's a life of torment in the sense that you are forced to become this sort of beast, right?

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:25]** That's the idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:31]** So I just walk around eternally hungry and be like, willing, willing, come to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:39]** While we're talking about vampires, the best Nicolas Cage movie ever was... Renfield?

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:41]** Yes, Renfield.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** I haven't seen it.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:44]** I love that movie so much.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** I haven't seen it.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** I like it.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** It's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:48]** It's so good.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:50]** I mean, the best Nick Cage film, though.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** That's great.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** Right.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** Better than Gone in 60 Seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** Dude, wow.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:56]** Gone in 60 Seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:58]** Was that a Nick Cage movie, though?

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:58]** Is that?

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** Yes.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** It was like an ensemble film.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** He played Dracula.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Oh, yes.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** Oh, yes.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:06]** He's so good at it.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:06]** He's really good.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:06]** Go watch it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** I haven't seen it.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** Go check out the surfer coming out soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** Is he going to be a surfer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:16]** Or is that just like a movie that you're like... You're an amazing man, Nick Cage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** Nick Cage surfer.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:19]** I really want to watch the one where he's in people's dreams.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** That one I'm very curious about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** Yes, I want that to happen to me.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** I want him to be in my dreams.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:26]** You want him to be in your dreams.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** Can we make a pact?

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:31]** If one of them becomes a vampire, please let everyone else know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:37]** Kelly, after your take on Hamilton, I don't know that I trust you.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** Yeah, I don't want to spend eternity with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:45]** No, no, no, but we can turn each other into vampires and just chill forever until the huge death of the universe.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** We could be recording Will Save.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** No, but you're just going to shit on Hamilton the whole time.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:56]** Why don't you just be our blood boy, and we'll just drink your blood from your toes, and then we're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:02]** And Will knew the actual Hamilton, so he was like, no, it was actually a really good representation of the original man.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** He rapped like that, too.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** Wait, can I just read this real quick?

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:10]** Nick Cage, the surfer, here is the summary on IMDb.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:24]** When a man returns to his beachside hometown in Australia, he is humiliated in front of his teenage son by a local group of surfers who claim ownership over the scheduled beach of his childhood.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:28]** So does that mean that Nick Cage is going to play an Australian?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:28]** I guess.


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:29]** Dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:31]** He can do anything, man.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:33]** He can do anything.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:35]** His power is unlimited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:39]** He is a true eldritch being.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:44]** If you just look up images of him, it's just him holding a surfboard.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:46]** It's just not supposed to be a thing.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:50]** Stop being things that you aren't, but please keep doing that, actually.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:52]** Because it's what makes you great.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** God, he's so incredible.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:56]** It was awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:05]** Before we get off of vampires, I have to say I've been on a bit of a horror kick recently.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:10]** Midnight Mass on Netflix was so good.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:33]** i really want to see that i really want to see that is it a movie or series it's a series it's a series and it it lives up i don't want to say anything else about it because i don't want to spoil it for you but it like i mean it asks some serious questions to to the what to the viewer to the community it's it's a lot of the cast members from the like haunting of hill house sort of like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** Yeah, I was going to ask.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:35]** It's the same director.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:37]** It's a lot of the same actors, but it's not all the same actors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:43]** Well, spoiler, I just looked up the images of it, and I'm not going to spoil it for anybody else.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** Don't search images of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:52]** It reminds me of one of Stephen King's shows from the 90s.

**[00:15:52 - 00:16:11]** storm of the century oh yeah it's like it's like a storm comes into a small coastal town in maine because of course it's maine and someone shows up and he says if you give me what i want i'll go away it's good spoilers thanks john no no chaos ensues yeah yeah it's good


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** Did you read the summary on Wikipedia?

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** No, I watched it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** I actually like watching horror stuff sometimes.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:19]** It's cool.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:21]** Midnight Mass sounds awesome.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** And with that, you know what I would watch?

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** Again, we'll say the musical.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** You know where we are?

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:30]** We are around episode 111, where you all are deciding what to do.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** I mean, Act 3?

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** Yeah.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** Is this Act 2 or Act 7?

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:36]** Or Act 3, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** It's Act 3.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:39]** It's a two-part musical.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:46]** So you've got to buy tickets to the first part, and then you've got to buy tickets to the second part, because we're money-hungry creators, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:46]** Yeah.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:50]** No intermissions, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:50]** None.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:53]** We draw in a musical theater for seven hours straight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:57]** And you know who is our guest star opening night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:00]** Nicholas Cage, not Miranda.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Lin-Manuel Miranda.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:04]** He's going to write all the songs for us.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:11]** I just want to say, Kelly's character dies in the first scene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:15]** I want to say the rest of the cast of this show


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:35]** is huge fans of you i want to formally invite lin-manuel on to just like chill please you know yeah if he would come play as a character that'd be awesome that would be amazing we wouldn't invite hit us up at we'll say the podcast.com why don't we just awkwardly invite other people that like i insult like uh what's his name who else have you insulted that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** That one guy.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:39]** You're still insulting him right now.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** Matthew Lillard?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:47]** Matthew Lillard is actually in this industry, so it would be awesome to have him come play as a character.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** That would be great.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:48]** Fantastic.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:50]** That would be a huge get.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** Who else has Kelly insulted?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:55]** I feel like he's insulted the UK, so we should just get someone from the UK.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** David Gallagher.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:02]** But then, like, that's a realistic thing that if I asked him to come, maybe he would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:06]** And then there was the guy at the con who's, like, already a vampire, kind of.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:06]** No.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:07]** Matthew Lillard?

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** No.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** Worst movie ever.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:24]** oh the wish no yeah yeah yeah what is the name i know uh the room the room what a character he would be oh hi mark


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** Oh, hey, great story, John.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Yeah.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** Every single wall check would fail.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** Could you imagine that as a grade?

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** Yeah, absolutely.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** The flat as a grade.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** As a character.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** That'd be scary.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** It'd be great.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** He could play the vampire.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:40]** He'd be really good.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** And apparently there are vampires in Starfinder.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** I just looked it up.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** It's a thing you can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:51]** So your next character is also going to be a soldier, but maybe the one after might be a vampire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:51 - 00:19:20]** Yeah, that's cool In order to suck blood though, you'd have to actually enter the combat though That's the thing that I found out in what we do in the shadows Yeah, and I think everyone would be like don't come in no, I mean I bought I bought curse of Strahd the other day we could do vampires There's also


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:25]** Have y'all played Haunted House on the Hill or whatever?

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:27]** I really want to play that.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** It's so f***ing good.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** Betrayal.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** Yeah, that one.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:34]** Let's play it at Gen Con.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:36]** It's such an amazing game.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:39]** That was one of the first adult board games I've ever played.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** As an adult, I should say.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:43]** With this renaissance board game.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:43]** It was amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:47]** It changes every game.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** It's never the same twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** Yeah.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** It's really cool.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** The map gets built.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:52]** I'm down.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** Let's get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:58]** Yeah, because the whole premise is that you're a bunch of kids exploring a house.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:00]** And you start off with the front door.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:05]** And every turn you take, you flip over a card to make the next room as you explore the house.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:06]** Cool.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** So that's how the game is built.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:11]** And then after so many turns, an event happens.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:17]** And depending on who flipped the last card and what the card is, it depends on the outcome of what happens next.


## Speaker_0

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:22]** And so, yeah, the first time we played, there was like an alien invasion.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:27]** The next time we played, there was like a mad scientist that put bomb collars on everybody.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:31]** And it's just, yeah, every game is completely different depending on.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:33]** That's cool.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** That's a fantastic game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:41]** That sounds a lot like our last episode where we started at a door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:45]** It's not like we're 25 minutes into a banter or nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:45 - 00:21:13]** yeah no no it's good yeah we're 15 20 so it's good it's good trying to keep it to a tight hour so we're really helping find her out by just bantering the whole time you start at a door and you're talking and then you you head into another door where you hack into a computer that's our recap that's what happened that's the whole thing that's fantastic recap that's it easy i found at some point dr okay found that his i was gonna go electronics were sus


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** We found a bug.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** It was named Here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:20]** Dr. Okay found that there is a camera.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Here's EXE.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** That's a dad joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:24]** I'm just saying.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** I still didn't laugh.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** It was good.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:29]** It was about here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:32]** Yeah, I'll look my glass like halfway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** The situation protocol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** You find, Dr.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:41]** O.K., a microphone and a camera that are active in your room.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:52]** Meanwhile, the rest of the party, plus Kaniko, are hacking into the computer in Orvier's office.

**[00:21:54 - 00:22:06]** You find that there is a schematic of Tyrkala's base and an overland map of Tyrkala's base on Varos.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:14]** And then another structure that is clearly set as an emergency meeting point somewhere else on Varos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:18]** We got to mention that Kelly got a map that said something on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:29]** I was too busy trying to like do this freaking finder line from like last episode that I only paid attention to the part where like there was a map with like things we haven't seen yet.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** And you but you said there was like two locations.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** What was that about?

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:32]** Could you please?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** There was another map.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** And by the way, that line was from Finder.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Thank you, Finder.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** I didn't see that.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:37]** From last time.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:38]** No, thank you, Finder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:41]** That was very hard to bring in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:46]** I'm going to bring you back to Tercal's base, and I will show you the map once again.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:51]** You can see that there is a, in the top left corner, there's a structure.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:57]** And then in the top, or in the bottom right corner, there's another structure about, I don't know, a couple hundred miles away.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:07]** And the let's call it the interstellar symbol, the well-known symbol for emergency meeting place, which are four arrows pointing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** Is that true?

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** So basic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** Yeah, I hope not.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:18]** I expect like some sort of yellow exclamation point or like red.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:19]** I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** It's like more arrows be like here.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:26]** Or like a sign that says emergency meeting point.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** It's too much text.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:34]** I do want to note that the second base looks much larger than the first.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:36]** It's like four times the size.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:39]** It looks like 25 miles across.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** To the northwest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:45]** I will say that you would not think there's a scale for distance.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:50]** It's not necessarily accurate for the actual size of the structure itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** Lazy cartographers.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** Lazy cartographers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:56]** Jonathan, which would you refer to me like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** Do you not like that?

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:58]** I'm sorry.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:58]** That's fine.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** It's okay.

**[00:23:59 - 00:23:59]** That's fine.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** It's fine.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** Jonathan, which would you call me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:19]** swanathan uh which uh which base are we in the one with the arrows you just unlocked some core memories for me it's been like decades since we've called him swanathan it's such an easy thing to i'm surprised you don't still call him that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:21]** It's spanking for it.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:26]** All right, cool.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:26]** The other one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** Which one is that?

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** I wasn't paying attention.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** You think that you're in the top left one.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** And then there's another one down to the bottom left.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:35]** The top left one.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:45]** And right as that happens, as you bring it up, there's a knock and then a and the door opens and Red is standing there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** Hey, y'all.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** How are we doing?

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** What's going on in here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:54]** I tried to invite him to our crossword puzzle, and he looks at Sylvania.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:55]** Oh, wow.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:58]** Rick is really good at those, I guess.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** So, yeah, you should go help.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:03]** You should have fun with that little crossword puzzle.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** What's going on, Red?

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:10]** He quickly let his hands down the moment that he heard the door open.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:33]** and but you're sitting behind the desk yeah you're sitting on the desk well kaniko's with me kaniko and i were just uh uh like checking out some some funny videos oh that's awesome playing on negros what what's the what's the video can i can i see it and takes a step in past bernice old hollow projection of alexander check out the red

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** I mean, are you cool?

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** Red, are you cool?

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** What do you mean?

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** I mean, like, are you actually cool?

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:44]** Or are you like a snitch, Red?

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** No, I'm cool.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:46]** Okay.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** Does this computer have access to the internet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:50]** It does, right?

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** Yeah.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:54]** Okay, so here's just like pulls up like a... Solid Fingers.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:57]** A video of Solid Fingers, yeah.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:22]** is in the war the war okay i can't remember how the lines go wow yeah this is creepy right yeah it's creepy kind of kind of funny though like okay it makes me laugh i mean it's kind of just a legendary video red but whatever yeah yeah no no wow i'm not funny kind of need to roll a bluff check on that one red because i'm not really convinced what's a bluff check it's okay

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:26]** you're not good at bluffing, Red.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** But that's all right.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** We'll just say you check out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** I think it's funny.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** I just don't laugh that often.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** That's it.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:33]** That's fine.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Oh, okay.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:34]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** All right.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** Well, I was just kind of concerned here.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:40]** You all were in here for a bit, but Kaniko, is everything okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:42]** Yeah, it's absolutely fine.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:49]** Just wanted to show them some videos and walk through some, you know, I was showing them a bit about the other crew members and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:50]** Oh, okay, cool.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:51]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** All right.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** Well,

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** I'm going to go watch more Salad Fingers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Make sure you do.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:00]** There's a couple episodes, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:00]** Okay.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** All right.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** Bye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** Walks out.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:03]** Spoons.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:08]** And he walks back and he looks at you, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** He's like, I really did think that was funny.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:12]** I don't know why they didn't think it was funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** It's all right.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:18]** I agree with you that laughing does not always mean enjoyment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:21]** Everyone's can be like a cold-blooded...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** Do you want to come watch Solid Fingers with me in the office real quick?

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:27]** I've never seen Solid Fingers.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:28]** Sure.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** Well, I just watched it.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** You didn't watch it?

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** Come on in.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:32]** Come on in.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** Rick will follow him in.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:34]** Okay.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** And you walk through the door.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Which one's the door?

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:40]** You're walking through the blue area, which is glass.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:43]** So... Rick 19's Achilles heel.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:44]** Doors.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:45]** Glass.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** Mirrors.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:48]** Mirrors.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** He's like, who's that?

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:51]** Who's in that mirror?

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:55]** Dr. K, what are you thinking right now?

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** Dr. K, what are you thinking right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:10]** I'm thinking I'm going to use my telepathic amulet to tell here there's definitely our rooms are bugged.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** This room that we're in right now?

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:14]** Our living quarters where we're staying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:21]** Here's just going to do a check in this room for any sort of bugs, video, audio bugs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:24]** Did you go check the other room, Dr. O'Kay?

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:24]** No.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** Okay.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** So you've only found that one room is bugged so far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** Yes, this is true.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** So there's a bug in my room.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:34]** It's safe to assume that all of the quarters are bugged.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** I hear you, John.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:36]** I'll go check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:39]** Okay.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** John, can I check this room as well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:51]** Here's, and I'm going to assume that Kaniko is probably going to assist, and here's is going to roll a perception, and Dr. O'Kay is going to roll a perception as well.

**[00:28:52 - 00:29:14]** natural one natural 28 one no for i mean it's 13 or whatever but 13 yeah i mean yeah you don't find anything in there what's interesting though is you think okay there might be but you walk in and you didn't find anything but you you've succeeded so well on the other one

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:27]** That you realize that you could transmit false readings, if you wanted, of an empty room in the one that you found them in.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:37]** So you could go back in and you could probably... Manipulate it to... Yeah, you could either disable it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:40]** Or... No, I'm not going to disable it.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** That's a rookie move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:44]** Or you could set it to be empty.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** Hijack it.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:46]** Come on.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:46]** False readings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** This is like National Treasure, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:55]** Or we could put a recording of somebody sleeping there and loop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:56 - 00:30:00]** Or we could just feed salad fingers to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** Or just feed salad fingers.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:05]** Speaking of salad fingers... Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** is going to manipulate it.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:12]** If he discovers that he can hijack it, he's going to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:12]** Give me an engineering check.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:16]** And while you're doing that, here's what you get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** Sorry, my... 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:25]** Here's what you get on your perception check.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:44]** i got an 18 so with kaniko's assistance 20 yeah you don't see anything in there you don't think that there's anything in the guest office will you got a 22 sorry you said engineering it's an engineering check yep yeah 22 for what okay oh are we doing engineering checks now

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** Well, you're not here.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** We're not.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** Yeah, you're not there.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** It's just Dr. Okay.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:55]** So, Dr. Okay, you think you figured out how to disable it.

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:06]** You would need to get a higher role to figure out how to transmit a false reading or take time if you wanted to, like, you know, take 20, which I think you can take 20 on an engineering check.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** Can you?

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:11]** If you wanted to take 10 or 20 on it, instead, you could do that if you wanted to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:15]** But you think that with a 22... I'm not going to disable it.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:16]** Okay.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** I'll try again later.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:19]** Okay.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:22]** Because it doesn't... We're not using this room at the moment.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:23]** Sure.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:24]** Sure.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:33]** But if it makes it advantageous, perhaps, while we're committing our heist... Hmm.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:46]** I, uh, I tell here's, uh, telepathically here's, I have an idea for when we, uh, give them the slip.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:54]** I say we all congregate and we loop us playing a board game inside our room here.

**[00:31:55 - 00:32:01]** And so they'll be under the impression that we'll be playing a game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:06]** Meanwhile, we'll be, well, investigating.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:09]** Here's response telepathically.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:12]** And he fails.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:20]** So he's going to, like, say out loud and well, it'll it'll be heard by everyone, including Dr. OK.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:21]** All right.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** Cool board game.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:24]** Yeah, that's that's great board game.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Sure.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** And then we'll go together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:30]** What board game are we playing?

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** What's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** You'll see soon.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:32]** This is Kaneko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:35]** That's not creepy at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** Ticket to Ride.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:39]** Yeah, look, Ticket to Ride is my favorite.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:41]** Actually, Jenga is what I usually play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:44]** I mean, can we play Terraforming Mars?

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** I feel like it's a longer game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:47]** That's perfect.

**[00:32:49 - 00:33:03]** Kanika looks at the schematic that you have of Tikal's base, points out the room that you think is the reactor room, points out the room that you saw somebody monitoring and says, that's the command center.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** That's actually where a lot of things are routed through.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:09]** There's a lot of different controls there for the station.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:17]** Um, and then she points at the Veros map, points to the top left corner and says, huh, that's, that's weird.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:24]** Uh, Tyrcalis base is not that small, but she points to the top left and says, that's Tyrcalis base.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:31]** She points to the bottom right and says, this beautiful four arrow symbol that everyone knows is the emergency meeting point symbol.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:35]** It's very simple and clear is the Terrapin station.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** I believe that's the only other place that it,

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** that they would put on here.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:43]** I feel like there's not a lot here, though.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:45]** I'm a little disappointed.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:48]** I thought there would be more for Morvir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:48]** On the map?

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** Or in the computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** Just on the computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** What were you hoping to find?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:57]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:08]** I thought some sort of strange message or maybe a diary, journal, blog, maybe just something that was unusual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** Some kind of smoking gun.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:11]** Yeah.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** Yeah, I agree.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** That would have been...

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:24]** I mean, while we're sneaking away, as you've proposed, we can check at some more terminals, you know?

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:24]** Okay.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:28]** Including Orvier's if you think it's appropriate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:29]** Wait, sorry.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** What was that?

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:33]** Your telepathy was coming in and out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:35]** Including Orvia's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:36]** Including Orvia's.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:38]** Well, this is Orvia's terminal right here.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** We're checking.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:39]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:40]** Yeah.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** Okay.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:43]** So that's why we're in here to begin with.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:43]** Yes.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:44]** Well, cool.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:46]** That would have been good to know earlier.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:49]** I did tell you earlier, but maybe you might have forgotten.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:49]** That's fine.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** Okay.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** All right.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** I'm Koneko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** You know who's really good at remembering things?

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** It's Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** Yeah, oh, okay, good.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** What?

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:57]** Big party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** His memory is beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** It's a beautiful mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:05]** Hey, look, let's get out of here.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** I've seen enough salad fingers.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:11]** It's just been playing on loop the whole time in the background.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** Let's leave.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Things are a little suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:20]** I think I say to here is telepathically, hey, come back to this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:23]** I'm getting a message from Dr. O.K.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:27]** to come to his room, so we should probably check that first before we move on.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** I think it's important, okay?

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** I think that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Here, before you close the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** I'm getting a message!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:35]** I know.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** I'm receiving a message from you!

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** A message from you!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:43]** You sound just like the legendary tale of Araxalite.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:44]** Yeah.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:47]** Look, hey, do you all have my personal number?

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:49]** I think it's important that we stay in contact.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:51]** I'm going to go talk to the inheritance.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** Get those digies.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** Colin, I didn't give it to you, but you already have it?

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** That's okay.

**[00:35:59 - 00:35:59]** All right.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:00]** Here, here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** This is my number.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** It does like a bump.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** That way you can get the push.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** Wait, what?

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** Oh, okay.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:07]** All right.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:09]** Just kind of does like a contact transfer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:12]** With that's like a 10 year old technology.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:15]** That's like a 15 year old technology, but okay Does that anymore?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:26]** Fair enough they do People in 2010 and then when you when you send a message be like, hey, yeah, it's here Hey, that's Colin.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:29]** There's actually a the ringtone is Hamilton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:37]** So I want ring back tones is what I want Yes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:37 - 00:37:06]** uh that's uh rolls a perception that is a good musical that other one on the computer as they come around okay because red was like oh come watch it on my computer so he's gonna roll perception as they come around and then see if he notices anything on the screen yeah i like it what's your perception check uh i forget it's a 16 on the die for a total of 23 23 that's really good yeah you're able to see that he's quickly pulling up the salad fingers he has a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:31]** they're non-security related like one is for a dish for a really good casserole one is for like clothes that he's shopping for uh that's on one monitor and then on the other monitor it just looks like there's some communication between him it's like the the the slack right like the instant messaging for the base

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:52]** and you see some conversations on there but you don't see anything useful in there anything that would clue you in cool thanks this is i'm beginning to think this is not legit what's not legit he pulls up salad fingers and legit is short for legitimate um the uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** Re-legitimate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** Re-legitimate this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** Can we re-legitimate this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** What is the legitimate part?

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:06]** It's legitimate, but like... Let's look up the root word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:08]** But go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:12]** You're saying that you think Red's computer is not real?

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:14]** Or it's not like the actual security computer?

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** This is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** It makes sense now.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** I don't know.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:23]** I don't know if this is the Discord getting into my head, but is this a sham?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** This is what I was worried about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:30]** There's nothing security related on the security person's computer?

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:33]** Is that not raising alarm bells with anybody else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** No, I follow you.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** Say that again, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:38]** This is the Robert Downey Jr.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** and that man is playing Galaga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:46]** Because that's the only thing.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** Red is the security watch right now.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** That's what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Yeah, I also thought that.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** This isn't the real security station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:56]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:04]** But I don't know that because I'm in the hallway about to create a distraction for us for the real security station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:05]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:06]** Right now?

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** Well, I'm going to prep it.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:19]** And I want to enlist the help of our compatriots to do so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:20]** Yeah.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:21]** Okay.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** So who's heading where?

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** Rick, you're watching Salad Fingers.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** Kimiko is stepping out.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:30]** She's like, all right, text me.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:32]** Let me know.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:52]** and walks out and starts to head down to the peritons quarters dr okay you probably see her in the call in the hall hey dr okay uh here and she bumps you this is going as well the her number just in case you've seen who do i see as she opens the door you see a all


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** Colin's just following here.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** Chilling next to the door?

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** Hey, Doc.

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:00]** Yeah, I'm... I have an idea.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:06]** When we decide that we're about to go on our...

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:15]** It might be helpful for whoever's monitoring us to, well, see us in our room.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:16]** Wouldn't you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:24]** I heard what you said earlier about, you know, making it look like we're just playing a board game or whatever.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** I think that's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:52]** here's in color now with dr okay and did yeah so i can help you with that with the hacking yeah i know you're quite good at that yeah and bernice now that she's here who colin is just super confused because i don't think here's shared any of that well i just told you kind of subtly in the hallway because i don't know if the hallway is bugged too but i know the room's uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:52 - 00:41:02]** So Rick saw everybody leaving and Rick is going to, he's going to look at red and say like, I know I was not laughing, but I did find that humorous.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:06]** And then he's going to turn away and walk out to follow.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** I thought it was funny.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:16]** And then as the door shuts, you're like, he's literally a hyena.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** You should be laughing.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** And that was a good, that was a good laugh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** Red is red is the, the knoll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** Okay.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:28]** So y'all are standing in a line in a hallway.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** What's going on?

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:41]** So I explained the plan to Rick and I said, we're going to pretend we're going to sit in these quarters here.

**[00:41:42 - 00:42:06]** and uh we'll record it and then when we're ready to go we'll have the heck already set up and ready to uh deploy as far as uh a diversion to let them at least confuse them as to where our whereabouts are uh i have an idea that is a solid plan i do have to note that the security room with red


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:08]** does not seem to be a real security room.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:12]** It seems like he is just watching videos and looking up recipes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:17]** Which could be the sign of a bad security officer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:18]** Or it's a ruse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:20]** It could be the sign of a ruse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:25]** I just got to say, like, we can set up this thing in your room, doctor.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:31]** But, I mean, if they see us going down the hallway, you know, you know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** It's just going to confuse them.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:36]** And we're going to do it at the right time, I imagine.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:36]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:41]** I'll help you out with whatever you want.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** So, I'll follow your lead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** All right.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** Okay.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:45]** So, are we ready?

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:47]** And Rick shoots something at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:53]** Without even looking, he just points his gun back and just shoots it.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:55]** But I'm not a killer at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:56 - 00:43:00]** I had it on stun mode.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:02]** Sorry, so are you ready for what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:06]** Well, okay, so if I do this hack, do I have to employ it right away?

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:08]** Or can I wait, like, delay?

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:14]** Can I put, like, a, you know, a timer on it for when the party's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:18]** If you hit five above, I'll say you can put a timer on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:20]** Hit five above the existing DC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** Oof.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** I don't know that I agree with that.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:30]** And I just want to make my case with the caveat that this is John's world and we're just playing in it.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:37]** If I try to initiate a hack, I dictate whenever I hit go.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:53]** And so, like, my impression of that instance would be Dr. OK would wait until it's time for us to put up the veneer of us chilling in the room to hit go on that hack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:55]** I think I agree because, like, you can.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** Oh, I see.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:59]** I mean, if you have remote access to something, you can just do it whenever.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:01]** So if we get remote access.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** I mean, you guys are f***ing coders.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:06]** He just puts in a while loop that says, while time is not this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** But he wants to start it at a certain point.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:10]** He wants to activate it.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:12]** It's just a cron job.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** You want to put a timer on now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:18]** I want to achieve the hack while we're here.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** We're here.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** We have time.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** If I have to take 20, we can take it.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** That was my thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** I guess, yeah.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:29]** The question is, can he turn it on whenever he wants to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:54]** but you say you can turn it on like i can't turn on remotely but i'm gonna put it on a timer right so you would just say like that that i i think like you would need to be there in order to instantiate the whole thing happening right yeah but if i were to if i were to delay like if i know when do i know when the party is has that been communicated

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** Yeah, that was communicated a bunch.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:58]** It starts at 6 o'clock.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** No, tomorrow.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:00]** It starts tomorrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:03]** But I'm just saying, it starts at 6 o'clock, so set the timer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:06]** 26 hours or whatever.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:07]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:07]** That's fine.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** It's currently 1.30.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** I think that's fine.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** I hear you, Vinny.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** I see what you're saying.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:18]** I think it's fine to set in the timer for when it's going to go off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:21]** I assist that shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** Plus 2.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:23]** Plus 4.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** This is a computer stick.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** It's an engineering check.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:27]** Oh.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** Wait, really?

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** Do you assist on engineering?

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** You've got to ask for a check you're assisting on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:36]** I assist on engineering.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:38]** Colin wishes you all the best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Bernice assists.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** It's a plus four.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** Okay.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** It's a plus six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:47]** Can your drone assist you on checks?

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:47]** I believe so.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:49]** I think we identified that we could.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** Can drones assist?

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Yeah, I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:52]** I don't know.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** We're still looking for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:54 - 00:46:21]** what is your role oh wait drone can use your skills ranks oh no but that's my skill rank never mind that's a different thing okay okay yeah yeah i was thinking about it more makes sense that you would okay um wow so that's a six 26 plus six four or four right because it's from here's and from colin doesn't have a check to me okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:50]** and bernice can assist or no right i don't think bernice can unless we find out but either way i think you're you're you're pretty confident you're like cool i've got a recording i can set a timer what time are you setting it for uh let's do what do we what do we say gents uh you think that there's going to be a party tomorrow evening past the start or do we want to make it tighter


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:51 - 00:47:17]** can always go back and disable it i suppose let's do 45. probably do it slightly ahead of the event right so that they don't come looking for us to interrupt us so that way we have our excuse and they already assume that you're at the party at that time so you would not be in our rooms we would not well i think like we're gonna end up just looking like we're avoiding the party


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:27]** No, what I am implying is that if you were to try to set it for a time that we would be in our rooms, then it would look as if we are not in our rooms, which would be confusing because we should be in our rooms.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:30]** but you are setting it for a time that we should not be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:34]** I think we should set it for some time after the party has started.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:40]** We'll slip out and say we're tired and retire quick for the evening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:52]** Does this video you've talked about, is it of all of us in a room or an empty room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:57]** I was thinking of all of us in the room to be a distraction, but

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:57]** Maybe not.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:06]** Because, like, if we could move about with avoiding some of those... I mean, I don't know.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:09]** Maybe... Because I don't think an empty room is useful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:10]** I...

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** I would agree.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:15]** I think the four of us in here would be effective.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:26]** Maybe during... I would roll it right after the party starts, sort of like Rick was talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:30]** So we shouldn't go to the party?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:31]** I think we should go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:39]** Well, I was implying that if we were to leave our rooms to go to the party, and Rick puts up very obvious quotation marks...

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:43]** they would not expect us to be in our room.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:47]** And so then they would assume we were at the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:50]** But they're all at the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** Which we wouldn't be in our rooms anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:57]** But we would go to the party and then excuse ourselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** Duck out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:59 - 00:48:59]** Yes.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:01]** And start the board game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:03]** But then we wouldn't be back in our room, so it doesn't matter.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:06]** The point is, you want to make it look like we're really in Doctor Who.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:15]** Excuse ourselves from the party to look like we were maybe playing a game from Paizo called Starfinder.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** Yeah.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:37]** in the room while here's gonna do an engineering check on while we escape to you know wherever uh the the slightly bigger base on the other side of this map here just a little bit of misdirection yeah something to slow him down maybe even for a moment a ruse of our own

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:46]** Or, you know, do we put up a video of us going to Terrapin Base while we sit in the room and play Starfinder?

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** That's my vote.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** I retract everything I said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:54]** I think you're right about putting a scene of us in the room when we're not.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** That's what we want to show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** Yes.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** Yeah.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:57]** Yes.

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** I think that makes perfect sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:01]** Because the other way around doesn't make any sense because we're not going to be in our room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** First place.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** Let me read the rules.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:10]** Place nine ocean tiles on their reserve spaces.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:18]** And so you all record a video of you playing the game real quick?

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Yeah.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:19]** Cool.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:20]** I love it.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:21]** I love it.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** Is it actually a Starfinder?

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** Well, I was doing Terraforming Mars.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:29]** Settlers of... Settlers of Akaton.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** Settlers of Akaton.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:32]** That's it.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** That's the game.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** During that time...

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:41]** I think it is Dr. Okay and Here's and Colin.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:45]** You get a text from Keniko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:49]** Oh, because Rick didn't get the number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:49]** Bummer.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:52]** She texted me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:56]** Here's hides his device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** He's like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:25]** guys please listen what do i say what do i say back what's it say it says update on the hangar

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:45]** hangar doors require a command override apparently that can only be done from the command center restricted area let's chat around dinner time guys she asked me to dinner


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:53]** All the rest of that must be code for like how to approach her and stuff.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:56]** You can only open my hangar doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:00]** Only you can make these doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:05]** She said, I need to get to her command center before I can open her hangar doors.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** What does that mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:12]** I think she means for us to go to the command center.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:17]** Yeah, let's do that just in case it means that as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:24]** Because I see you at the top here and the doctor.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:25]** What's that?

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:26]** Is this?

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:30]** This is a group chat, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** I don't think I got that number.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** I don't think I got the digits.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:38]** She bumped you the number when she saw you in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** I am.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:43]** So I'm not sure what, you know, how the Pikes Paterson's get down, but sure.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:47]** That's, um, should we all go to dinner then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** I think that's probably a good idea.

**[00:52:51 - 00:53:01]** I'll have to have a talk with the chef about his salt use, but we'll just be there to accompany you and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** And, and, but yeah, we do have a mission too.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** So we'll, we'll accomplish that at the same time.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:07]** So,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:17]** So I think right now we have a 10 to 15 episode interlude of us playing Terraforming Mars.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:18]** As our characters.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** I'll be the set pieces.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** You all be your characters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** I do not understand.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** I put the tile where?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:33]** Make sure you have no corporate era cards in the project deck or among the corporation cards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** I've never played this game before.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** What do these mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:53]** I like that there's this moment where you all are like, we don't know what's happening here, but there's kind of this forced moment of good-natured fun as you're like, we're recording a video to dupe these stewards.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:59]** But we need to have fun, so maybe we should just have fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:06]** The first generation starts with the out-of-player order phase and without a research phase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** Are there political factions as well?

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:10]** Yes.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:22]** Or am I just like... So you're a corporation terraforming... So is it... There's like a fascist undertone sort of thing that I can get into?

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** Is that what's going on as well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** What?

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:24]** What?

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:24]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:24]** No.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** What are you doing?

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:26]** Well, no.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Hold on.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:27]** Hold on.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:29]** This is not what I mean.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:31]** I'm talking about insane corporations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** Kelly is just like... All right, cut that out.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:33]** I didn't mean it like that.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:35]** I didn't mean it like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** Fascism takes many forms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:39]** He really is.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:42]** I have a card that says Thestron has run out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:45]** Is this our first coffee-only episode?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** Terra Forme Acuton.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** I feel like.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:51]** Amazing.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** So how long is this recording?

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** You said 45 minutes, 90 minutes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:56]** We're at about an hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** I'd say an hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** I think if you're looping that, it would take a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** Yeah, and I mean...

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:07]** Yeah, looping an hour, I feel like that's safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** So it's an hour.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** I bumped time forward a little bit.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** It's about 2.30 or so right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:16]** Oh yeah, we got that stupid slider at the bottom of our map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** So what do you all want to do now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** It's 1430 currently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** It's 1430 on day one.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** You've had two interviews.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:34]** You've decided to team up with one of the Paratons to figure out exactly what the true nature is of the steward secret base that you're on now as you're on a hellscape lava moon.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:39]** And you just had a relaxing game of terraforming Accuton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** I would not call that relaxing.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** Who won?

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** O.K., of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:47 - 00:56:15]** yeah well it was all well and good until here started cheating i had to cheat because your resource management was shady like to say the best i don't know i don't really i feel like i was it's fine listen i i was uh you know the awards and the milestones they're very confusing i get it uh i was able to calculate that i would not be able to win after only three turns


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:40]** yeah yeah sure sure sure that's why you kept saying i'm totally gonna win it like turned like 11 and 12 and 13 that is called a bluff right all right so what do you all want to do right now it's a few hours until dinner should we just kind of skip ahead you all just doing some


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:43]** I mean, should we explore?

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** Are you giving us the opportunity to explore?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:49]** I'm asking what you all want to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:56]** Colin, I think, grabs here and says, hey, we've seen a little bit of this base here.

**[00:56:56 - 00:57:01]** Should we use the schematic to try to see what we can see?

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:06]** Or is that too risky to... I think...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:13]** Given the circumstances, I don't think our hosts would...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:39]** mind us wandering in around at least this area that they uh have placed us in i would assume they would almost expect that do you want to look yeah go ahead yes you want to head to the yet uncharted areas of this base uh from our perspective uh we i think we have to wait until the party uh to do that probably


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:41 - 00:58:04]** um but i think we will do it and he he has the map and he shows it to everyone on his data pad or whatever okay have we been over there in this section yet off to the left i mean this is i feel like that's to go to that's a window so it's just outside yeah but i don't i don't think i've been like anywhere else really like any of these areas but where are these areas


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:15]** There's also this room next to... What is this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:20]** Just to the right of the hallway that we are in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:22]** I'm going to...

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** Yeah, when you walk in, it's a toilet.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:29]** I'm going to say that you guys are spending a little bit of time walking around seeing things.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:31]** There is a toilet to your immediate right.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** There's a toilet to your immediate left.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:41]** Kaniko's room is right across from Colin and Dr. O'Kay's, right?

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:46]** Colin you would know that or viewers room was right on the left side of Colin a doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:55]** Okay, so I think space I think then yeah Colin Colin is gonna do two things The first is probably obvious.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** He's gonna go seek an ego.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** I Expected that early.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:03]** Yes He's gonna knock on the door

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:07]** Because he's a gentleman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:07]** She's in the hangar, though.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** She's not in her room.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** Because she's a gentleman.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:13]** He leaves a note for her.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** No one answers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:15]** He shoots her a text.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:24]** He's like, I am... And he types out M. Are you free?

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:28]** I had some questions to chat about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:37]** She shoots you a text back, likes your text, and then shoots you a text back and says, yeah, we're playing Terraforming Akaton in the lounge here.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** Wait, what kind of like?

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** In which lounge?

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** Just like a thumbs up.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:42]** Wait.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:44]** Thumbs up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:48]** And that's the place we were like, that one?

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** Just north?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:52]** Yeah, the place that you were hanging out, yeah.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:59]** Was she monitoring us playing Terraforming Akaton and then decided to play Terraforming Akaton, or is this just a bit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:07]** Are they just terraforming agitons laying around all over the space?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:10]** How deep does the paranoia run?

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:15]** Those waters run all the way deep.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** There is no end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** I know they do.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** I shouldn't say that.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:22]** It has spilled out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:24]** I'm an android, but my body is 80% water.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** And it's all tainted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** And it's all for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:31]** O is Orviet in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** No, he's not.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:36]** He doesn't play games.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** Not anymore.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** Oh, right.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** Not after the incident.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:43]** What does that even mean?

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:46]** Tonight's actually the anniversary of the last game he played.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:54]** They light a candle and there's like a little shrine with Polaroid pictures of all of your plans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:57]** God, we can't get through just like this.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** So have a peace for him.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:00]** Yeah.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:02]** He's like, guys, I'm right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:07]** All right, so... I'm just going to abandon that plan.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:14]** I was going to try to figure out if there was some way to expose Orvir, to trip him up in some of their past.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:37]** battles or instances to to figure out if he is who he says he is or if he's been replaced by something or what like that dealio is got it dr okay did you you you said to them or what did you say to them about uh the recording in the other room or did you like look again later were you gonna look again what was that all i mean we could look again i suppose okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** I think you guys can take the time.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** Yeah.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** Go ahead.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:49]** Before we go any further, Rick would have pointed out all the different places that he saw when he was in the hallway on the map.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:51]** This is the garage.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** This is the warehouse.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:54]** This is the command center.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:57]** Blah, blah, blah.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:57]** Okay.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:01]** But then, metagame-wise...

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:02]** We did it on the Chimera.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** We did it all the time.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:05]** Like, let's go sneak into somebody's room.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** Rick's not the one to suggest that.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:14]** But Kevin is suggesting we break into Orvio's room and sneak around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:15]** I don't disagree.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:19]** I thought we were going to... It's just a question of risk.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:21]** Because we were going to, I think, originally do it.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:24]** We talked about doing that with Kaniko when...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:27]** She was talking about breaking into his computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** Which you already did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:33]** But it's just... Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:35]** Right, right, right.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:36]** Not saying that you don't.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:40]** I'm just trying to say that was her intention was, hey, go check out the computer, which is next door.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:41]** That's right.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:43]** We can still check his room for stuff.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:43]** Sure.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:49]** And the thing is, you all, you know, it feels like you're starting to, like, put together your facts.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:57]** And so speaking with Kaniko, again, is kind of the, like, determination of, like, what might be what's going to happen next.

**[01:02:57 - 01:03:25]** next that's like the sense that you got from her text like all right we should maybe finalize a plan what what else did you did you find do we need to do something tonight before the party do we need to wait until the party and use tonight to find more like like understand more about what's in these other spaces or yeah let's just whatever yeah yeah that's kind of what i'm thinking um so in the other room i will say that

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:50]** you do determine that that room is also bugged you find that there is next to it next to one of the scanners right one of the microphones you find that there is a phase detector which you can pick up i don't know who wants to take a phase detector but it's a it's a device from the armory book i'm down for it if nobody else wants it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:53]** Go for it, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:54]** You guys find a phase detector.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** And we skip ahead.

**[01:03:56 - 01:04:01]** I'm assuming you guys are lounging, taking a shower, Colin, you were sweaty.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:04]** And we move into dinner time.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:06]** I'm going to put us at around 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:10]** Wait, during that skip ahead, what did we find in Orvia's room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** I don't think that you go to Orvia's room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:13]** Okay, fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:14]** That was a nice trick.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:19]** Unless you guys want to, and then we won't skip ahead.


## Speaker_0

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:19]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:21]** We can wait on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:26]** Let's go ahead and say that you all are heading into the galley, yeah?

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:28]** Yeah.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:28]** All right.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:30]** We'll start walking that way, I guess.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:30]** Okay.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:33]** All right.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** Where?

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:38]** It's up here on the right.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:41]** Towards one of the top rooms under the anger.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:43]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:44]** Oh, look at that.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** I can't get through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:48]** Yeah, you remember from eating in here earlier today that there's a long bar.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:50]** There are a couple serving drones.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:51]** There's some cooking equipment.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:55]** You all can, you know, use the culinary synthesizers.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:56]** Who keeps closing the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:58]** I'm trying to go through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:01]** Everyone's closing and opening the door at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:03]** Guys, I just want the door.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:04]** It opens like this.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** Oh, there's no room for Colin.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** Everyone make room.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:09]** Make room.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:11]** Yeah, there we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:14]** All right, so you all sit down at a table.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:16]** You grab your food.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:18]** Hope you grab something tasty.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** Dr. O'Kane's probably no salt.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:21]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:28]** I like a nice mucus blend and some vegetables.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** No salt.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:31]** Nice vegetables.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:32]** No salt.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:32]** Love it.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:34]** You all sit down at the table.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:38]** Kaniko comes over to you.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:40]** Looks around at all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:42]** Why do I think that we're about to get into combat?

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** Yeah.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:47]** The entire atmosphere just seems like that, including the music.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:48]** Yeah, I agree.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:52]** I have a funny feeling about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:53]** She sits down.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:55]** She looks at all of you.

**[01:05:56 - 01:06:00]** And she says, All right.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:02]** I'm in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:06]** The Peritons are all in.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:11]** And I think we need to leave Terkel's base.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:13]** Yeah.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:17]** Not right now, necessarily, but let's make a plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:19]** Before Dr. O.K.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:23]** discloses any more, can we check this room for bugs?

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:30]** Have you checked around this area?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:30]** I have not.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:34]** You want to do a quick perception check?

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:34]** I do.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:35]** Yeah.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:41]** And I actually got a 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:44]** I'm unable to assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:52]** So just to be clear, like we walk into the, this, the galley mess hall and there are, I can't count them cause I can't count.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:55]** Um, five, six, 12.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:58]** There's 12 total people now, including the four of us.

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:02]** Um, and that, are there all peritons?

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:05]** Yeah, they're all peritons and some droughts.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:06]** Yeah.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:08]** Except for there's no Orvier, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:09]** No.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:10]** Okay.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:11]** Just want to clarify.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:13]** Peritons are not Orvier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:45]** We have an idea.

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:55]** I was able to kind of engineer a decoy, so to speak, in our room.

**[01:07:55 - 01:08:02]** I set it to go off 30 minutes after our party tomorrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:02]** Yeah, okay.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:26]** this is so it's gonna decoy wait a decoy because oh that's right because you found you did tell you told here's and here's told her right that you had found bugs yeah or no yeah yeah okay right got it yep totally so after the party it'll look like you're going back yeah we'll retire for the evening after uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:29]** Some hamming up some frivolity, perhaps.

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:31]** Got it.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:31]** Okay.

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:32]** Yeah.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:34]** We'll leave that.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:37]** How long do you think this party will go for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:39]** I don't know.

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:47]** I did find out that there's going to be some part of it, right, that's either in the warehouse or the hangar.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:53]** So I think, and you got my text about the controls for the hangar door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:59]** We're going to have to find some way to open it from the command center, maybe while you're playing your game, right?

**[01:08:59 - 01:09:01]** Which, by the way, you were really good, Dr.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:05]** O.K., from what you told me at Terraforming Akaton, so we should play some time because I'm good, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:07]** I get all the milestones.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:08]** As she's saying that,

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:16]** I think maybe she's not looking at the door, but you all are.

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:23]** And the door opens and inspector jocks her to standing at the door.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:25]** And that's our game.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:26]** Whose jock's hurt?

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:28]** Yeah, that's Hurd.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:29]** Oh, it's Hurd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:31]** It's a Hurd, Hurd, Hurd.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:33]** Hurd is the word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:34]** You hurt?

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:37]** Yeah, he is standing there.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:40]** Sour on his face, like always.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:43]** He's upset that we didn't invite him to play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:49]** Guys, I really love Terraformer Akaton.
