## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:44]** I am currently in California and so I am in John's office and I've been sitting about two feet away from him while we're recording this.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:44]** So

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:51]** If you hear an echo and weird stuff, it's because I f***ed up and John couldn't edit it out after that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:51]** Yep.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** And it's going to be a good time.

**[00:02:54 - 00:03:00]** And I'm going to put all my sensitive stuff on the screen right in front of me and not in front of this screen that Kev can see.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:01]** Over here.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** So just don't look over here.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** Don't cheat, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** Kev, Kev, what's the conspiracy, Kevin?

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** What's the Kev?

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** What's the conspiracy?

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Is that what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:14]** I'm going to see him, like, flash something on that screen and be like, oh, my gosh!

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:14]** Ah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:40]** you guys won't believe what i just saw guys guys i swear control control your chaos chaos monkey for this one while you're in time here is my question of the week my question what is what is your favorite time of day and i'm gonna tell you i don't like afternoon afternoon

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:44]** I don't know if this is some synesthesia thing, but I remember being young.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Wait, what's synesthesia?

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:50]** It's when you see sounds or you hear colors.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:57]** And I remember looking out when I was younger and seeing the setting sun come down Lone Star, Vinny.

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:01]** And there was just something about it that I was like...

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** No.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:06]** You did mushrooms one time.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** Yeah, when I was 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:10]** When you were like a 10-year-old kid.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:15]** But seeing the morning sun, I'm like, oh, thank goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** I want to go next.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:21]** After your explanation, of course, because I have the same.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** I don't like the afternoon very much either.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** I don't know what it is.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:30]** The sun's in your face, and then everyone's rushing around all the time because everyone's coming back from work.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** It's hard to see out of your car.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** It's annoying.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** Everyone's in a rush.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** Wait, hold on a second, though, John.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** I need to hear about the synesthesia thing.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:42]** Does that mean that when the sun was setting, you heard it be like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:42 - 00:05:02]** like you could just hear like the fucking like no no what do you mean because i know what it is but i didn't know that it extended to that which it would be cool if it did but i just don't know what it is like why do i get this emotional reaction when i'm just seeing like consistently when i'm seeing the afternoon sun why do i feel like or when i see the morning sun


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:04]** Morning sun, I agree with you, is definitely my favorite.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:08]** So when I don't have to do work or something else, I definitely prefer the morning.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:14]** So on a completely, on the most, all else being equal, I prefer mornings.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** So I think I agree with you.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** Yeah.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** Anyway, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** Mornings are best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** Agreed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** No?

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:27]** I'm one of those that I very much appreciate a sunset.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:32]** In the morning, I'm too wound up.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** I'm sort of like a spring.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:46]** If you think of like a mainspring in an automatic watch, where it's just been winding up and winding up all night, and then in the morning, boom, everything goes.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:51]** And thanks, camera, for just inserting a thumbs up there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:56]** I think that's Sonoma, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** I should probably turn that off.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:11]** In the morning, I'm so focused on getting shit done that by the time sunset rolls around, I can...

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:29]** sit back and look at look on all of the things that i've done in a given period and you know maybe spend some time with a person or people that i like and so you're thanos enjoy it yeah and sunset is my farm yeah it's right before i get decapitated yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** I think I've got them on that same spectrum.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:36]** I like evenings, not necessarily the sunset part.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:43]** It's beautiful to have the orange sky coming out of the window, but I like the evening after things sort of settle down.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:56]** I think it's also a time that in the summer it starts to cool down and it's just a better time of day.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** It's the best time of day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:14]** it's funny you talk about that at the because that bedtime is sort of like sunrise part two for me because like as soon as I get those two lovely absolutely cherished beautiful

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** Hellions.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** Locked in a room for the night.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** I can clean.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** I can put all the things away.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:28]** I can vacuum and mop the floors and do dishes and do all of the little things that you can't do with little ones running around.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:30]** And then I can sit back and enjoy it.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:34]** So it's almost like I have two days in one day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:41]** There's a window for me if it's right after dinner, but before bath time, it's about a half hour.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:45]** Where Grayson, he's got food in his stomach, so he's calmer.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** And his cousin plays by himself somewhere.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** And then Amelia, we finish cleaning up after her.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:54]** That's a time for us to just finally decompress for everything.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:56]** And then we jump into bath time and bedtime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:00]** Kevin, for you, bed is like 5 p.m.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:02]** So like, what are we talking here?

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:05]** Like when, like you mean 4.30 or something?

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:06]** What time of day?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** Well, Grayson goes to sleep now.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:12]** He starts to go to sleep at 7.30 and is actually asleep by 8 usually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:14]** Okay.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:14]** Okay.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:16]** All right.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:19]** Will, what's your favorite time of day?

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** What's your like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:23]** My favorite time of day or least favorite time of day?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:24]** Either one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** What's your relationship with time?

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** See, that's the thing.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** As a time traveler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:32]** That's not your relationship with time.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** Hide.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:33]** Oh, no.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** What have I done?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:42]** As a time traveler, my least favorite time is tomorrow.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** Because that's the only time you don't know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:49]** Can you travel into the future or something?

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:52]** If you go to the future, it's complicated.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** Let's not get into that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:55 - 00:09:02]** I feel like if you go too far talking to us about going to the future, you're going to come in this door behind me and shoot Kevin.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** I, cause we started this.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** So you'll stop the episode.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:05]** Oh my God.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:06]** Yeah.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:08]** No, you have to close the loop.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** Yeah.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** Yeah.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** Got to close the loop, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:17]** I guess if we're going off of that logic, then the morning tracks as my least favorite time.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** And it's pretty accurate.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:20]** I hate waking up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:25]** Well, since Will is a time traveler, I guess I would have a slightly different question.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:35]** If there was a loop-to-be-closed looper style, what actor would play young or old Will, depending on...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** I know who it would be.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:39]** I'll have my own answer to this, but I want to hear Will's.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** I want to hear Kelly's answer.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:45]** Who's the f***er who plays the big Lebowski?

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:47]** John Goodman.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** No, not John Goodman.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:50]** Who's the guy who plays the Lebowski?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** The dude, yeah.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Jeff Bridges?

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** Jeff Bridges would be you.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** Young Jeff Bridges?

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** I could see that.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:00]** Yeah, I could see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:03]** Don't say Hugh Jackman because he's too tall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:08]** It's true, we have to accurately cast Will according to height.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:11]** According to height, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:15]** We need to have somebody who's 5'11".


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:18]** I know a Kevin that could help out with this.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** You're 5'11", right?

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:20]** Right, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:24]** I'm 5'10".


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** That's the thing, he's tall.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** You always say he's not tall.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** What is most much most?

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** Is that like European?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** Yeah, that's tall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** Sometimes there's

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** You're measuring devices that are off.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:42]** Listen, if you've only measured yourself in the frame of a 7-Eleven, it's hard to tell.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:51]** Hey, cashier, how tall am I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** Okay.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:55]** Jeff Bridges is 6'1".

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** He's too tall.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** However... Is he too tall?

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** Josh Brolin.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** He's too short.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** He's too short.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** Josh Brolin.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** Josh Brolin is 5'10".


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** I'm actually taller at 6'1".

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:04]** I was just joshing around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** Yeah, he is definitely taller.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** 6'4".

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** 6'4", yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:10]** I was trying to figure out what you were talking about because I knew we were comfortable.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** I know.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:11]** I was just messing around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:12]** I was having fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** I was having a laugh, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** I was just messing around, having fun.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:18]** You know, just like you asked the cashier at 7-Eleven random questions.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:19]** I think I'm going to start doing that.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:22]** I'm going to start thinking of really odd questions to ask them.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** It probably won't be the oddest thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:26]** Do you get good TV reception here?

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:30]** It's red.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** Should I make this flight or this flight?

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** Yeah, don't ask for ghost stories.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:35]** Oh my god, no.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:36]** Do you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:40]** I would actually be interested in hearing... I'd come back to that.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** That's true.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** A 7-Eleven clerk?

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** Ghost stories?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:47]** Oh, wait, wait.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** I just want to give a shout-out.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:54]** Was there something you wanted to give a little shout-out to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:57]** Maybe it's the same shout out you were going to give.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:59]** I was going to ask you, how did your interview go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** Let's say it at the same time.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** I want a shout out.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** I want a shout out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** I want a shout out.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** Tom Talks interview.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** Tom Talks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:12]** We were thinking the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** How was it?

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:16]** You and Kevin were interviewed on one of their shows.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Tom Talks, right?

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** I don't know who Tom is.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Tom Talks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:23]** It was a great time.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** It was awesome.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:36]** it was Adam and Heath and they are great dudes and it was funny because like at one point we were like this is less of an interview and more just like a hangout and that's true it felt like that we were just


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** I just felt like we're talking about Starfinder.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:41]** We're talking about what it takes to do a podcast and what it talks about.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** Who's Tom?

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** Talking about California.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** Yeah, who's Tom?

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:47]** Where's Tom?

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** Their name is Southern Tom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** So Tom.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** So that's where it comes from.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** Oh, okay.

**[00:12:54 - 00:13:01]** We did have a good in-depth dive about our geographical superiority, I'll call it.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:03]** How we are just all over it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:24]** wait what i mean how about california really interested in diving into how you arrived at superiority right i just went with it a couple hundred miles of each other where we spent continental united states


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:27]** Be like, everyone remember, John is better than you.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:35]** Not only geographically, but also he can hear everything that he visualizes as sound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:39]** I just look out and I hear the sun screaming at me.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:56]** like every morning that's why i love the morning because i wake up to the sound of the sun wild all right you guys ever seen it's my favorite video ever is the grinch doing yoga


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:02]** If you haven't seen us, Google it right now and make sure you're following us all the way up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** That sounds scary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** That sounds like hearing damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** Yeah.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** And I already have enough of that.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:15]** And that's also why we are talking so softly today is to avoid hearing damage for all you listeners.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** Yeah.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** All right.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** Y'all ready to play?

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** Should we play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:21]** Yeah.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** I'm still loading this French video.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** I saw some of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** I'm going to be in the middle of my recap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** I'm not actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** No, he's definitely not.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:32]** All right.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:40]** So, if we think back, it's hard to just pull ourselves back into the land of Starfinder.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:42]** Space that Starfinder inhabits.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** Remember how it felt

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:54]** to be landing on Varos, the lava moon of Brithida.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** That's no moon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:01]** I mean, it was good, because, yeah.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** How it felt to be coming in on the Voidcrier landing.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:12]** Don't forget that you got off, you met the stewards who are there currently.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:23]** Jock's herd, the commander of Varos, their presumably number one, the Vlaka, that didn't really respond well to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:23]** Years.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** Oh, is that the dog person?

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Yeah.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:27]** Yeah.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** Turn around and walk a bit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:29]** Yeah.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:34]** You met a couple other, the lower stewards, lower rank.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Red.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Sylvania.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:36]** Brick.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** Lilac.

**[00:15:39 - 00:16:08]** baxter name starting to every one of those names perfectly good awesome yeah i'm glad yeah uh no it's good because i had to go back and remember what i had named them so i was listening through being like what was their name again that's right you met dr rel nodance enthusiastic to get to know you to learn more about what's what's happened very curious very curious yeah yeah

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:13]** And this is a chance for you all to take a minute to relax.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:22]** You had that opportunity on the, on the ship and now you're not actively, you know, in any dangerous environment.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** So this is a chance for you all to relax.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** So what do you do?

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:32]** Hang out, Rick, you're going through, you're like, Hey, Hey, Android abolitionist front.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:37]** I'm going to message you on my AOL messenger and there's no user.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:41]** what website didn't work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:47]** I mean, would he be on AOL aim or would he be on like MSN?

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:50]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Yeah.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** That's right.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:57]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:00]** Uh, Colin, you did a little chat in yourself.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:13]** You're going around, chatting with the parentans, asking questions, you're researching news, trying to find out on the infosphere on Tercala Space, like, what's happening in Akiton?

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** Come to find out, you know, the infosphere is a little limited.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:20]** It seems like they're not refreshing daily.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:24]** They're combing through, making sure the data is clean, what they're pulling in.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:27]** Subject to infrequent updates, let's say.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** And then you chat.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** You're like, hey, Orvier.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:33]** As people are talking, you are going to eat.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:36]** You go to chat with Orvier about your purpose there.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** Do people leave?

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:42]** He's mostly gone.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:48]** Mostly gives you some answers, but it seems like he's not entirely forthcoming.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:49]** He knows something.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:51]** Dr.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:59]** O.K., you were gathering information, chatting with all the guards at the entrance to the restricted area throughout the evening.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:01]** Just getting to know people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:03]** Just friendly chit-chat.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** Just friendly chit-chat.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:05]** No other motives.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:09]** Getting to know some friends, what they like to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** How they spend their off time.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** Yeah.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** What time the shift changes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:18]** Casual running them.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:21]** I mean, that's what I ask 7-Eleven employees frequently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:23]** Hey, when is your shift?

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:26]** Hey, when do you guys open the safe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** Okay.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** Kevin, help me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** Don't build them up like that.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Don't build them up like that.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** Give them false hope.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:21]** I would desire a plus three or something, you know?

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** That's what I need right now.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:23]** Oh, for sure.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:25]** Definitely at least level 15 or above.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:30]** You have any Forneum Venom casters lying around, by the way?

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** I need some of those, too.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** That's been rebuilt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:35]** There's no limitations on using that.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:38]** So if you find memory that's level 20...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:38]** Sure.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:42]** If you find it in the game that I run, good luck.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** Good luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** That sounds awesome.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:49]** Kevin, when John's away from the computer, you know what to do when he goes for a bio break.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** So that's why you wanted to record here.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** You're like, oh, definitely record here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:56]** This is a plan by the four of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:59]** John, do you remember that game that was based on the Matrix?

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:00]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** On the GameCube?

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:02]** Yeah.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:14]** One of the game mechanics was you could hack in and type similar to the code in the Matrix, and you could just drop weapons into yourself, Matrix-style.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:14]** What?

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** That's awesome.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** You mean like GTA?

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:38]** uh no when she comes on gta or just do it i mean yeah sure sure like it's the matrix right the matrix enter the matrix enter the matrix yeah you had to like know dos decently well in order to oh yeah yeah yeah that's how we got anyway that's what kev that's what i need you to do for the dose really


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:42]** Wait, but Matrix era?

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** That doesn't make sense.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:47]** That predates to the Matrix, though.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** Matrix is like Windows XP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** Are you talking about just like command line?

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:56]** Like you just had no Unix commands or something?

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** I'm looking this up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:00]** You all go to sleep.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** It's the end of your kind of first...

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:09]** I don't want to call it your first day there, because it was kind of a half day.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:20]** But this is kind of the start of your first day here, because as I move you over to the map, the Tyrcalis base map.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Chika-chika.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:22]** Unfounded.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** Chika-chika.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Chika-chika.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** Chika-chika.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:30]** You'll recall that I've put in this module that allows me to move time forward.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:32]** It's linked to the lighting.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** I do recall this.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:41]** In this base that is somewhat of an oasis among the craggy, fiery red landscape of Veros.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:46]** There is a base with blue floors, nice blue lighting.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** The inside is nicely furnished.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:55]** Definitely juxtaposed against the crazy volcanic activity outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** You did not tell us that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:05]** So if I keep going, like, as I do it, as we get into the evening and morning, you'll see it.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:08]** I've seen your witchcraft.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** It's pretty cool.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:09]** Yeah.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** Good stuff.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:10]** Thank you.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** Shout out to, uh, is it small time?

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** Quick time.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** Forget which the not quick time.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:19]** I think it's small time is the name of the module.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:19]** Colin.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:30]** There's a... On your door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:35]** What did you do?

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** What time did you say it was?

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:37]** Seven o'clock.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:41]** Do I have the time on your...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:44]** I do.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** We're an audio medium as well.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:48]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:54]** So Colin, I think, is going to... He was already half-awake glancing at his data pad.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:59]** And so he's going to hop down and... Oh, you're Tapa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:03]** Yeah.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:10]** I saw a really good image online that was like, are you a Triceratops or a Triceratop?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** Nice.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:21]** Colin is gonna... Is there a people in this store?

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:21]** There's not a people.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:25]** Is there any, like, camera outside that Colin can see?

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:26]** No.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:28]** Or is this just like... Yeah.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** Hi.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:30]** Who's there?

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:37]** There's a brief second where you hear like... And then there's a knock again.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:42]** And then you hear...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:50]** I'm here to bring you to your medical check and debrief.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:56]** Is this Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** Actually, I did.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** I rolled a natural 20.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** Oh, well, no.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** It's a plus 2 to equal 20.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** It's an 18 on the die, plus 2.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:22]** Yeah.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:26]** Rick doesn't wake up.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:26]** Okay.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:29]** I was just checking the, uh, the plus 10 DC modifier.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** Yeah.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:30]** Thank you for that.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:31]** Yeah.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** You don't wake up.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:34]** Here's here's doesn't wake up.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Oh, no.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** I don't want to leave video by myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:44]** So Colin, having donned his armor, pops the door open.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:51]** Noticing Dr. Okay is still asleep, he steps outside quickly and closes the door behind him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:59]** As you open the door, you see a Sheeran with more bluish green in their skin.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:03]** They're wearing a white coat that looks like a medical lab coat.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:06]** It's pretty fastidiously done up, except for the top.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** One of the top buttons is actually, like, mismatched.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:12]** They have all of their antennae.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** None of them are clipped.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** Oh, yeah, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:15]** Thanks for that.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:21]** Hey, I know that I'm asleep, but can I move my token out so I can see the only other Sheeran I've ever seen?

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Like, in Foundry?

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** Or World 20, for that matter.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:24]** I want to see him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** You'll have time.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** You'll have time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:31]** And as you step out... You're just going to walk up to me and ask me what kind of species he is.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:33]** Hey, are you Sheeran?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:59]** oh the dog or the hyena as you step out colin he's like hey uh silverton nice to meet you shakes yeah shakes his hand sorry for the early morning uh rise here i'm guessing that the doctor didn't tell you when or you didn't get a notification


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:04]** Aye, I've got, well, GM, did I get any notification?

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** I don't think I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:09]** No, Dr. Knowles didn't mention anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:13]** Aye, yes, she didn't mention what time we might be getting an inspection.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:18]** All right, well, no worries.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** It happens.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** It's pretty early.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:20]** I know.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** It's early for me, too.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** He turns, starts to walk down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:33]** As they walk back, Colin starts asking about life, like, in the station.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:36]** But also, like, gathering more information on what goes on here.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** Totally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:38]** Okay.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** Silverton is...

**[00:27:41 - 00:28:09]** responsive you like that kind of response where they're like just doing their job um not rude but they're not going to be like oh totally like they're not trying to be worth coming yeah thank you you said it in so much fewer words that was needed it was great so they walk up and you actually see uh sylvania at the end of the hall of the restricted area and as silverton walks up

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:16]** Pulls out a little badge, shows it to Sylvain.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:22]** Sylvain looks down, nods, and then reaches behind to unlock the door.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:51]** eyes i'm gonna see the restricted area and i'm gonna need kevin and will and kelly to move away from the screen so you don't see or hear anything i'm gonna i'm gonna slide over don't do that get out of the room what are you doing wait get out so what do i have to do uh just yeah just just just leave for like five minutes all five ten i'll just message you when you when it's time

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:56]** Okay.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** I'm so excited right now.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:10]** So Sylvania steps out of the way and the door to the restricted area opens.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:17]** You see a long hallway, probably about 40, 45 feet.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:22]** Silverton starts to walk through the door.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:31]** On your right, you can see, if you'll recall, there is the security office with the transparent glass to the right before you go in, right?

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** That's where you're talking to Red.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:38]** Maybe if you'll look over, you see the top of Red's, their head as they're typing away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:41]** Colin nods to each of them as he walks past.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:41]** Yeah.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:45]** And Silverton walks in.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:48]** The door behind you shuts.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** And you hear a... As it locks.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** You only walk in maybe ten feet.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:57]** And Silverton stops.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Turns to the right.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** There's another door.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** Heavy metal door.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** Takes out the badge.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:07]** And actually takes their thumb.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:10]** Puts it on to read a biometric reader.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:12]** And...

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:14]** They open the door.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** And they walk in.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:32]** Now, as you walk in to this medical center, you see before you, they all have Silverton step in, so you can just... They move in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:37]** Door shuts behind you, not like in a locked way, just...

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:42]** You see before you a state of the art for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:56]** Colin is going to like pseudo stumble into the room, but he's really going to hit the door button as he stumbles to see if it opens without any like authentication from the inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:58]** Yeah.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:01]** Like, I mean, it starts to shut and then it goes back.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:05]** If you want to do an engineering check, you can try and sell something out.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** Okay.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:09]** It does open if you press it to open.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** It wasn't locked when you were doing that.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** Don't forget.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:21]** Yeah, you see a state-of-the-art medical facility, not cutting edge, but clearly well furnished.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:28]** They have the money to provide for newer technologies.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:31]** You're not working in an old lab from before, right?

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:36]** you see that there's a laboratory corner in the Southwest.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:43]** There's, there's this area that's covered and separated from the main chamber by a curved wall of transparent material.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:47]** There's an archway on either end that you can walk into and walk out of.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:51]** It's somewhat transparent, semi-transparent.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:57]** You can see the gray hair of Dr. Nodens sitting down at the chair and hear the like tick, tick,

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:28]** right of things five beds across the room it's an open floor area the beds are quality nice sheets you've been around beds before there's a curtain rod in the ceiling for privacy and there's a metal door in the southwest or the southeast of the of the room you walk in silverton says hey why don't you just uh take a seat right there

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:54]** points to one of the beds it's or whatever you want um colin is going to have a seat not in the bed silverton indicated but to the one next to the door in the southeast yeah okay cool you see silverton walk into the arch at the southern end and dr nodens comes out

**[00:32:54 - 00:33:11]** the northern end you can see that silverton just goes to sit down at the desk and as dr nodens comes out peeks around her energy suddenly fills the room oh good morning hello colin it is good to see you i know it's early how did you sleep


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:17]** I've slept better than I have in the last few days, that's for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** That's great.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** I am so happy to hear that.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:26]** We try to make sure that our facilities, our quarters, our dormitories are relaxing places.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** So I'm so glad to hear that.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:32]** No bumps, no pains, no stiff mattress or anything?


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:33]** Nothing yet.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:38]** This is probably the most I've been poked and prodded since I've got in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:40]** Yeah, that's fair.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:44]** There will be a little bit of poking and prodding, but I really want to get a chance to talk to you.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:48]** We're going to have a chance to sit down, just do a little chit chat.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:50]** It's going to be great.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:53]** Doctor, where am I exactly?

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:57]** So you are in our medical facility, right?

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** This is our medical center, we call it.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:02]** And this is where we treat people.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:04]** This is where people come for their checkups.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:09]** I believe you are a doctor, Sasha, have medical training as well, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:10]** That is correct.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:16]** This is quite a lot of technology and well furnished for a clinic facility.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Thank you.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Yeah, we do our best.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:21]** I mean, we are part of the stewards.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:29]** I petition a lot to have more money come in every year so we can make sure that we are taking care of people.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** We are in a remote area.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:37]** And there are a lot of people that come in with unusual burns and, you know, unusual maladies.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:38]** Let's call it.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** Anyway, Silverton, are you almost ready?

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** And you hear, yep.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:45]** Silverton comes out.

**[00:34:47 - 00:35:10]** walks over to you and I'm just going to start with a little bit of a, you know, physical check starts to go through pretty typical checking kind of some basic things like reflex, checking your eyes, listening to your heart, looking in your ears, everything you would expecting.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:16]** Uh, and then during that time, give me a sense of motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** 15.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:28]** Seems like they're a little impatient, but ready to get going.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:36]** And then I'm just going to need to get some fluid, if that's all right, so I can check everything and see how things are going.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** With your consent, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** Which fluid exactly?

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** Blood.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** What exactly are you doing with it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:59]** Well, it's part of what we're going to use for just our database and making sure and checking to make sure that you didn't bring any foreign pathogens or anything with you or that you might not have some diseases that maybe you don't know that you had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** Can I roll another sense motive on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:06]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:08]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** Okay.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** She... Sorry.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** He is...

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:22]** mostly sincere again, a little not forthcoming, but you're pretty sure they're going to use it for something else.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:27]** He also seems like he is doing what he's told.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:31]** So he might not have anything to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:33]** Dr. Nodens.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:38]** What else are you going to use my blood for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:41]** Oh, well, honestly, it is just standard procedure.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:45]** So frankly, if you're not comfortable with it, I'm going to ask you questions.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:48]** I am fine to just move on and we can just get to chat.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** That is totally fine.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:52]** So Silverton, don't just put it away.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** That's fine.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** It's okay.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** No worries.

**[00:36:55 - 00:37:05]** She walks over, kind of takes the vial and the shot, the syringe and goes and puts it back inside.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** All right.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** Well, shall we have a little chat?

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** Aye.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** Okay.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** She motions after you.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:21]** The door opens in the southeast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:31]** Uh, Colin stands up and stares very intently at Dr. Newton's, but complies, moves into the next room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:35]** You're not, just so you know, you're not getting any sort of aggression from her.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** Just want to make that clear.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:39]** There's no aggression or anything from either of them.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:43]** So there, there's an agenda, but they're not pushing it very hard.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:43]** Yeah.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** They want, they do want to get to like check on you.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:50]** She seems like she's really interested in talking to you a little more, you know?

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** Okay.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** All right, feel free to take a seat anywhere.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** I tend to like to sit on the couch.

**[00:37:55 - 00:38:00]** You know, we do have a healthy budget, so I did make sure to get something, actually, that was from Castor Bell.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:03]** It's all based on plants, the non-sentient ones.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:06]** It's very, very comfy.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:08]** Colin sits at the conference table.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** Oh, no problem.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:18]** You walk in and sit down at a room that honestly looks small, clean, austere.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:25]** The gray table in the center really takes up most of the room.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Four metal chairs.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** You take the one facing the window.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:37]** The window looks outside because the table is lit up from the light of the volcanic activity.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** And maybe you can see a little bit of Brithida.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** You know, it's massive.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:48]** And so that angry landscape kind of comes in but is calmed by the window.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** And instead you just get this filter of light.

**[00:38:53 - 00:39:01]** she takes a seat across from you and then Silverton comes in and she says, all right.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:05]** Um, so this is very straightforward.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:08]** If it's okay, I'm going to just be asking some questions.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:10]** I just, you're going to be doing most of the talking.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:14]** Uh, I'm going to record it if that's okay.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:17]** And probably just have Silverton take some notes.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:18]** Is that okay with you?

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** I think that's fine.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** Turns, nods to Silverton.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:27]** Silverton goes over and sits on the couch.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:31]** And then takes out a recorder.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** Starts recording.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:40]** She just says, looks at you and says...

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** Let's take a deep breath in.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:43]** I know it's early.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** Thank you again for coming in.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** I really do appreciate it.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** This is very easy.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** It's very easy.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:53]** So I'm going to start off with some very simple questions.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:57]** Can you just tell me your name and where you're from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:02]** My name is Colin Edenbrant.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** I'm from Absalom Station.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:08]** Can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:14]** About your childhood or any significant events?

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:18]** Doctor, tell me about this line of questioning.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:18]** Sure.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** I'm just wanting to get to know you better.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:25]** It's pretty standard protocol for understanding more of what happened.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:29]** We will get to the recent events that have led you here.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** I just wanted to get to know you a bit better.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:31]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:48]** If you don't mind, I've certainly seen a whole lot of things in the last few days that probably hasn't certainly built lots of trust in strangers.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** Okay.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** If you don't mind cutting to the chase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** Oh, sure.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:53]** Okay.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:59]** Looks at Silverton just as like, kind of like, let's scratch that, you know, part of the questions.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:02]** So, totally fine.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** I understand.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** It's been very traumatic.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:10]** So, starting with those recent events, tell me how you arrived here.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:14]** Walk me through the events and your thoughts, your emotions.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** Share your story with me.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:23]** And I'll say for the sake of roleplay, go in as in depth as you would like.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:28]** You can also just give a very high level thing and I can assume that you're doing it more in depth.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:29]** You just let me know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:36]** Yeah, I'm like, Cullen doesn't trust what's happening here.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:36]** Okay.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:41]** And so he is similar to Silverton, polite but not forthcoming.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** Okay.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:51]** He's trying to figure, like, he's playing the chess game in his mind as well as they are.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** Okay.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:58]** And so he, I was on Akiton.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:01]** I'm a doctor, as we've mentioned earlier.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** Yeah.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:06]** I was on Akiton doing some humanitarian work and...

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:11]** There's a gap somewhere after arriving on Akaton.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:18]** And then I woke up in a bush that had mesmerized these strangers.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** Mesmerized?


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** Wow.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** Frassanaya, I believe it was.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:27]** Make sure to get that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** Frassanaya.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** Yeah.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** I woke up.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** They pulled me out of the bush.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:37]** They had a giant Kesti Rivener who was sentient.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:43]** And we went with him and fought a radioactive giant troll.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** Oh, wow.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:46]** Um...

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:55]** Defeated that and discovered we were on an asteroid of some kind.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:59]** Some sort of grey outpost called Micron.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** Okay, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:07]** And then we found your friends who made their way to us and got us off the rock, and now I'm here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:16]** Oh, so you... Sorry, so did you... So did you meet them before or after this troll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** I met them before the troll.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** They pulled me out of the Rasenaya bush.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:21]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** Okay.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:23]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:27]** I believe they took me to the troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** Oh, okay.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** Oh, wow.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:31]** They brought you to the, that's, that's old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:32]** Yeah.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:41]** The troll, it was, it was feeding off of a nearly melted down nuclear reactor.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:46]** And so we had to defeat the troll in order to stop the reactor from going off and blowing us all to hell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:50]** So you see her following your logic.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:51]** Okay.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:53]** All right.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** Yeah.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** So as you can imagine, it's been a rough couple of days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** Absolutely.

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** Okay.

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** Wow.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:03]** You tell it so much better than Gnarla's report reads.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** So thank you.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Yeah, that's great.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** Okay.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** Okay.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:09]** And then you got aboard the ship.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:12]** And then I understand that something happened aboard the ship.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Can you talk to me about that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:39]** i the um i guess similar to the gap from being on akitan and waking up in the nevrasan air bush there was another 24 hour period that was stolen from me um there were are you familiar with grace at all like the bedtime story hey

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** Yeah.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:40]** Yeah.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:43]** So then, yes, yes.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:47]** This may be a surprise, but they're real.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:51]** Make sure to get that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** Okay.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** The asteroid I woke up on was apparently a gray facility.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:57]** Hmm.

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:06]** And they had, I guess, followed us into the drift after Omicron disappeared.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:15]** And so they knocked out our drift drive and did all sorts of experiments on the entire crew.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** They replaced an eye.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:20]** They isolated another person.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:23]** They did something to my pelvis over here.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:26]** I'm sure you've noticed it in the medical examination.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:33]** Still not abundantly clear what they did, but there's a small incision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:33]** Okay.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** Yeah, we'll take a look at that.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:39]** Happy to remove that scar or anything, if you like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Fine.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** I'll put it to the collection.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** Sure.

**[00:45:45 - 00:46:12]** and so we ended up recovering some of the memories it was at that point the crew kind of turns on us and they were crazed with aggression and anger and everyone was either knocked out presumably because they tried to resist the craze or they were overcome by the craze and all tried to kill the five of us


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:18]** So they were there were experiments.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:24]** She seems like very curious about this part, but is letting you talk.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:26]** But you have her enthralled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:29]** Cool.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:40]** Yeah, so we did the best we could to knock them out instead of killing anyone because we could tell pretty clearly that they were not in charge of their own faculties.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** Okay, okay.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:47]** And so we knocked out enough of the crew to take over the bridge.

**[00:46:47 - 00:47:09]** and um tried to get away from our captives and we discovered that the the gray ship was right next to us the one that knocked out our drifters and so engaged in some ship to ship combat and made our way here okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Yeah.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** Thank you for sharing that.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** That sounds very dramatic.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** I can see what you're saying at the beginning of this.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:19]** Wow.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:20]** Okay.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:20]** Thank you for sharing that.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** I think that's about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:25]** I think having unloaded all of that, you hear Colin take a deep sigh.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:26]** Yeah.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:29]** I think that's the first time he's probably recounted the whole story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:29]** Yeah.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:35]** She goes, I greatly appreciate you sharing all that, like I said.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:38]** One last question.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** Do you have any secrets?

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:42]** Laughs.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:44]** Throws her hand up.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** Just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:45]** Just kidding.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:47]** I'll share mine if you share yours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:50]** Well, okay.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** I'll take that offer later.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** No, joking.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:52]** Okay.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** All right.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** I think that's it.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:58]** Silberton, could you please kindly, she starts to stand up.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:03]** Could you please go ahead and have Colin, take Colin back?

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** Doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Yes, please.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:11]** Before I leave, what are these notes and recordings and research used for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** Sure.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** So not research per se.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** This is just part of our debriefing process.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:26]** It's part of understanding exactly what you went through and making sure we can log that and know that there are these grays that you're talking about, learning more about them.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** I may have a couple more questions for you.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:29]** I don't know.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:33]** I need to just sift through, compare to the reports.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:35]** I don't have those exactly in front of me.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:44]** uh you see that they're there but and she's got like some marks so she definitely knows what's in them but she needs to kind of compare and read over your stuff yeah

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** So that's just about it.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:50]** Um, I'm probably going to go ahead and have, who do we have up next?

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** Uh, Silverton.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:54]** Here's, here's is going to come in.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:54]** Okay.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** Yeah.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:58]** So, so pretend if you could get here, Colin, if you have any other questions, let me know.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:02]** We are on a bit of a schedule, but feel free to message me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:02]** Yeah.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:02]** Cool.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** This is finished.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:09]** John, was she surprised when, when Colin brought up grace or was it like, okay, cool.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** No, she was not surprised.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:11]** Okay.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:11]** Um,

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:17]** Doctor, is this the first time you've heard about grey activity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:22]** She kind of leans in as if a little friendly.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:28]** She's like, I can either confirm or deny.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** And winks.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** Very heavy handed.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:36]** So anyway, but that'll be our little secret that we'll start to share.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:39]** Right, Colin?

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:39]** All right.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:40]** Thank you, Colin.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** Goes to shake your hand.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** Do you shake your hand?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:46]** Okay.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:46]** All right.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** He shakes his hand.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** Great.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:55]** She walks out, heads back through the, what do you call it?

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:58]** Back into the little like semi-transparent room.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:19]** area and uh soberton walks starts to walk out the door is still unlocked so as he walks through and gestures for you to go ahead and walk in front of him yeah and then shuts the door and you see once again that he uses his thumb

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:26]** and then he is going to reach over and use his thumb on the door to unlock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:31]** Because you mentioned on the way in that he used the badge and the thumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:36]** What I meant to say was that he uses his biometrics.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:39]** Then I realized that he wouldn't have biometrics in his card, probably.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** So he's going to use his thumb.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** So pretty much he just uses his thumb.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:45]** All righty.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** And opens the door.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:53]** Sylvania looks back and sees Silverton and then steps aside to let you go out.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:53]** All right.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:57]** All right, I'll follow with you because I'm going to go get here, of course.

**[00:50:59 - 00:50:59]** Walks through.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:03]** The rest of it's pretty... Do you say anything to Silverton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** He starts to watch on the whole.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:14]** I ask him, who's the last crew that you've interviewed like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:16]** The last crew that we interviewed like that?

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:28]** we did interview the Pike's Peritons and there was another before them but I can't remember their name another like knight sort of thing I'm not sure


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:33]** And they had seen Greys too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:42]** I can't comment on what they had seen, but I can certainly say the Greys are... Why am I talking like Dr. Dodens?

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** I slip into this imitation.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:45]** I'm just around her so much.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:54]** So the thing is, is that... No, I don't think that they did, but Dr. Dodens worked with several people.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** But to my understanding, no.

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:25]** what do you do um colin goes back to his room i think okay goes back to his room all right we're gonna we're gonna bring back everybody else you go into your room and uh i will message for people to come back let me message kev and just say hey kev come back all right boom okay i'm gonna pause for a second don't let kev

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** Okay.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:30]** I know Kelly don't listen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** Sneaky, sneaky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** Oh, Kelly, why'd you come in at the right time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** So sneaky.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** That was like a 15 minute thing.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** Oh my God.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:37]** What happened?

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:38]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:41]** Does Vinny know the entire conspiracy now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:44]** Vinny is aware of everything that he needs to be aware of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** Yeah.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:49]** Oh, he's going to transcend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** Vinny somehow knows less now than he did before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:56]** Yeah.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:58]** Perfect.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** Yeah.

**[00:52:59 - 00:52:59]** All right.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:00]** Cool.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** Oh, there he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** I'm back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:08]** I think the only reason John called us back is because I threatened to start calling him.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:08]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:11]** I opened the door, and there's just us cheering and chilling out in the hallway.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** Don't open the door.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** It's glorious.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** I'm sorry.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:14]** I'm sorry.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** He looks really good, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** Where did you disappear to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** Oh, you're awake.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** You're not going to believe this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:23]** I was awake the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:25]** They've let me behind the Iron Curtain.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:27]** Wait, the whole time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:29]** Yeah, I saw you get out.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:34]** I was going to say, like, you should take one of these knockout things that I got left over.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:38]** But you just ran out of the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** I didn't want to wake you up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** You could always wake me up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** Colin visibly rolls his eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:50]** There's a knock, knock, knock on the door of Rick 19.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** And here's Fabricius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Should I roll a perception check?

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:54]** Do I wake up now with a 20?

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** Would that work at this point?

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:58]** Like, I feel like I wake up, right?

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:00]** I think you wake up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:04]** All right.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:06]** Yeah.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** You, you both wake up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** Here's gets up.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:16]** I think he's on the top bunk.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** She jumps down.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:19]** It's maybe like 745, eight in the morning.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** Bump the time up.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:24]** Here's opens the door to see a beautiful shoe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:27]** Blue-green skin, white coat.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:34]** This time, the button, which you would not know, is actually buttoned correctly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:38]** Hello, are you here?

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** Oh, hey.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** Yeah, who are you?

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** Hey, I'm Silberton.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** How are you doing?

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** Silberton.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** I'm all right.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:49]** So, uh, what are you doing here?

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:52]** So here's, I'm actually going to need you to come with me.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:58]** You're going to have your, uh, medical checkup and quick debrief with Dr. Nodens.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** Dr. Who?

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** Dr. Nodens.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:04]** Was that, he talks to Rick.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:07]** He's like, was that the slately obsessed, uh, obsessed with this doctor?

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:10]** Is that the one?

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:10]** Yeah.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** Yes.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** Oh, I see.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** So, yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:40]** steps out allows me space to come out all right rick if i don't come back you know what happened to me uh see you later you're fine hey i i just want to say uh i don't know if you're an intern or whatever but uh you can see what happened to uh my uh antenna here right oh yeah that is yeah i feel like not good yeah you you you you get it you get it i'll

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** Yeah, I'll log that.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** I don't even know what I would do.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:48]** Like, what would happen to me when I start speaking out loud or speaking a different language?

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:53]** Honestly, it's like a 50-50 chance at this point that that happens for real.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:55]** So if you have any insight into that, I would love to hear it.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:58]** You start hearing the sun come up every morning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:24]** oh my god i literally cannot silence the voices in my head oh my god i'm so tired oh that's great i can't get it well i will come to your new year's now um because you made that joke we can hear the stuff come up together yeah let's do it uh so uh

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:28]** As you're working down the hall, I want to give Colin and Dr. O.K.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:31]** a minute to just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:57]** paint for me the scene if anything happens what do you talk about okay call it call it hops up oh okay um so we'd pass the the security outpost that you saw um into the first room on the right which is doctor you should see it it's it's the best equipped medical bay i've ever seen in my life

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:07]** They do not lack for funds here, which it's absolute overkill for what they've said it is.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:11]** And so I have to assume that there's something else going on here.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:14]** I don't know if that's experimental research.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:16]** Yeah.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:18]** I took lots of mental notes.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** There were five beds.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:25]** The locks, just in case we need to break in, are biometric.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:29]** The beds were usually high quality.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:35]** The doctor mentioned something about treating unusual burns and maladies.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:40]** Which, I mean, being on a volcano planet, you would expect quite a few standard burns.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:44]** But unusual burns are pretty curious.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** The doctor wanted my blood for some reason.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:49]** I would not give it to her.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:55]** Because they weren't exactly forthcoming with what they wanted to use it for.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:58]** And she wanted to hear about my backstory.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** My childhood story.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:02]** And how I ended up here.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** So I told them all about, you know, Absalom.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** Sorry, not Absalom.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Outpost Omicron.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** Outpost Omicron.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:19]** And, you know, the great incursion we had on the Void Crier on the way over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:24]** But I think that was it.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** It was about 15 minutes, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:35]** Yeah, it seems like it was maybe a little long in that, but... At this time, Rick knocks on your door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:37]** On our door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** On our door?

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:43]** Here's left with silver tips, so Rick can come down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** Colin opens the door.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** Hey, Rick.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** What's going on?

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:49]** Hey, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:55]** Here's just left with

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:58]** A silver pen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** Aye.

**[00:58:59 - 00:58:59]** The blue-green sheet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Yep, behind the iron curtain.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:05]** Come on in.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:09]** And Colin hops up on the top bunk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** Come into my room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:15]** Tells Rick, word for word, what he just told Dr. Okay.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:18]** Which I will not repeat, because we're done with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** So...

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:23]** What do you suppose we do about this?

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:28]** As there are not so forthcoming hosts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** What are they hiding from us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:58]** oh yeah you weren't actually listening yeah well out of character long story short they took me back there it's a medical facility really well equipped uh there's too much horsepower it's like too nice thing yeah um it's too nice asked for my entire backstory i gave them basically what happened on absalom not absalom i did it i did the same thing twice

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:20]** um what happened on outpost omicron and the void crier and how we got here oh there's there's something else happening i i'm not sure where this cough came from i wonder if she gave me something um what so what where is your concern

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** They wanted my blood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:28]** They are, in fact, investigating a grey infestation of some kind.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:35]** So it could be possible that they know your background to some degree and that they are trying to verify your information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** A grey infestation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** Did I know about that?

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:45]** Yeah, we all came from...

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** Comic-Con, right?

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** I thought for a minute you said Comic-Con.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:52]** We all came from Comic-Con.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** We all came from Comic-Con.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:56]** We all came from Comic-Con.

**[01:00:56 - 01:01:00]** We all came from Comic-Con.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:04]** So yeah, we all came from Comic-Con.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:11]** I think it's a general suspicion that we could also be the Graves guys.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** Is what Rick is stressing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:15]** Is that why you think she wanted my blood?

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:20]** She wanted to do a blood draw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:31]** That seems reasonable, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:43]** I'm sure there's all kinds of manner of sorts they can figure out with a sample of your blood, especially if that facility is well equipped as they say it is.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:54]** Tell us, did you get any eerie heebie-jeebies, so to speak, when they were explaining any of their procedures to you?

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:56]** Did it seem like they were trying to hide something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:59]** It seemed like they weren't telling me the whole truth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:02]** And what did your sense motive checks tell you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** That?

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** They weren't telling me the whole truth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:13]** Did you let them see the dice that you rolled for your checks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:18]** I don't trust these people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:28]** My question to you is less of whether you trust them because they are stewards or if there is a concern that they are not stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:32]** I've not got any indication that they're not stewards.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:41]** Silverton's uniform was a bit dishevelled, but that could easily be explained by a simple oversight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:52]** Maybe a little biased, but the stewards, their clandestine ways may not be necessary for what they're doing.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]** And for that reason, I think it might be...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:56 - 01:03:18]** that's that's absolutely fine for them i'm i'm not in a position to give them the benefit of the doubt right now and we'll fade off of that in a moment come back to silverton and here's standing in front of sylvania at the checkpoint to head into the restricted area

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:24]** Here's you see Silverton pull out a badge.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:38]** So he looks at the badge and then reaches behind, unlocks the door, and then opens the door.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** And that's our game.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:42]** All right.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:43]** For all this fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:44]** Kelly.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:45]** Kelly, you stay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:46]** Yeah.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** Yeah.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:50]** This is the Kelly and Josh over the next 20 minutes.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:50]** Yeah.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** Oh my God.
