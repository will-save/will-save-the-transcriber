**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:49]** Are you saying that you're persistent as a person or that like you are?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** What do you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** To find that.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** You don't listen to the episodes, Kev.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:58]** So maybe if you listen to this episode, you'll find out why.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:01]** Wait, Kev, you don't listen to the episodes?

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:01]** Dude, right?

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** I know.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** Who wants to listen to themselves?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:03]** I want to recommend to you.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** Well, listen to us to know if we did good.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** I listen to myself sometimes.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:16]** I do when our fans... Do you ever just watch your old movies and cry that you were in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:34]** No, I do have... When our fans mention things in our Discord or our friends, however you wish to identify yourself, I definitely will go back and be like, oh, somebody listened to Unknown Treasures 30-something or whatever, and I'll be like, oh, that was funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** We did blow up that bridge.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:38]** Spoilers.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** I just moved offices.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** So this is my new office downstairs.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** Look out behind you.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** There's something behind you, Kev.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:47]** Look, there it is.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:47]** There's Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** That's my Hot Rod Angel CD.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** I don't have a CD player to play it on.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** He played Ron Howard.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:55]** And then, yeah, I've got a Velociraptor behind me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:56 - 00:03:00]** It's holding my staff from when I played with STF and friends.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** What's their name, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** The Velociraptor's name.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:21]** think it's not the sdf friends it's actually blue from uh jurassic world yep yeah i know but what's it saying she's not a she's not a clever girl her name is blue that's true oh okay okay okay kelly have you seen jurassic park do you know what dinosaurs are uh

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:26]** I heard that there were these giant lizards that lived like 5,000 years ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:30]** They're actually more closely related to birds, and so they're actually more like giant chickens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** Yeah, dude, you're wrong.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:32]** Come on, man.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** Yeah, get with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:36]** I'm actually really sad that the Dilophosaurus...

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** Everything about that thing is wrong.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** It doesn't spit.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:41]** It might not even have frills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** Fact check this, Will.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:43]** You gotta tell us.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:56]** Cultures around the world have identified dragons completely independent of dinosaurs and other creatures.

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:01]** The Chinese zodiac has a bunch of real animals and just one fake one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:05]** Will will be back next, we'll say, Wednesday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:07]** Interesting facts.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:09]** Historical facts with William Garrett.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:15]** I would love a view from history with Will Garrett.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** Oh, yes.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:19]** Will.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** Oh, yeah, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:21]** No, no, no.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** I'm going to bring it up later.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:25]** I was going to talk about Shadding Stone, not on the Discord, because I want to do that from time to time.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** But yeah, from the Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** Let's do that right before we start.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:35]** Because I have to ask, today is the day after Halloween, as Kevin points out, usually happens.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:36]** Usually.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** Usually.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** Not always.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** Not always, but usually.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** And the question is, what did you do?

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:44]** Did you do anything for that spooky season before we move into the heartfelt season?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** So, like, I...

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:54]** I grew up in the hyper-conservative South, and so as a child celebrated no Halloween, did no trick-or-treating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:57]** You didn't even do Reformation then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:57]** No.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:59]** What was Reformation then?

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** That sounds like a Star Wars.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** Yeah.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:04]** I can always picture him, but I can't think of his name.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** Martin Luther?

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** Yeah.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:06]** Martin Luther.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Google Martin Luther.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** It's great research.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:14]** Did Martin Luther pound the feces on Halloween?

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** Is that the connection?

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:19]** On November 1st, yeah.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:21]** The day after Halloween.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:25]** Today is the anniversary of Martin Luther hammering the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** Which is, was it after Halloween?

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** We don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:27]** Right.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** All Hallows Eve, I think it would have been referred to at that time.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** That's true.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** If it even existed as a holiday, man, this is a historical rabbit hole we should really go down.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:36]** It's complicated.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** Let's do it for next week for a while.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:45]** So, I, like, as a kid did not, and so as an adult, I'm like, it is my mission to make Halloween special for kids.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:49]** So, like, I am the dude on the block that gives out the king-size candy bars.

**[00:05:49 - 00:06:09]** oh yes you're so nice and like yes you can take three you young four-year-old parent i'm so sorry um this year i loved an idea that i happened across last year where you had your box of candy for the kids and then you had your cooler for the adults and so

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** We're going to have a little something for everyone.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:17]** Come on by next year and find out what the Rodriguez's have for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** Could you tell us your full address?

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:28]** My full address is... I can find my way there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:54]** it's a really long address that also included google maps directions yeah yeah yeah for me the um the neighborhood actually gets really involved in halloween even though like last night uh the neighbors all kind of sat out in the front yards and one of them has a bonfire going and everybody kind of gathers there and hangs out and then they see kids walking by and then they go back and refill their baskets or whatever and it's a good time here um

**[00:06:54 - 00:07:14]** but grayson decided i was like oh do you want to be your halloween grayson and he said gwyn spider he wants to be ghost spider so he's ghost spider and the rest of the family we tried to dress up as other versions of spider-man so i was that's cool that's really cool yeah yeah oh have you seen into the spider-verse


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** Not the new one.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** Please don't spoil the new one.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:26]** I'm going to spoil one thing that I wish I had known when I went to see the movie the first time.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:29]** I did not know that it was a two-part


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** Oh, I've heard that.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** Yeah.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** It's a to be continued.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** It's a to be continued.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:34]** Spoiler alert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** I was so upset.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** I'm looking at my watch.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:38]** I'm like, there are so many loose ends.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:41]** How are they going to blow my mind in the next five minutes?

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:45]** Because this movie has to end, just mathematically speaking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:48]** To be fair, every modern movie is to be continued.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** But from what I understand, it's just a stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** That was a poorly managed expectation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:57]** It was, but Vinny, I do have to say, they did achieve what you said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:23]** Well, they did Go see it, but no more spoilers, but but manage that my neighbor said she took her five-year-old son to watch it and It said to be continued and the credits rolled and the boy sat there Waiting for the next episode to start We gotta go sign intermission, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** Yeah, I

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:27]** with a credit sequence.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:30]** It doesn't autoplay in another 20 seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** Yeah.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** That's sad.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** Kev, have you seen the new Mighty Pups movie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:57]** um Mighty Pups from Paw Patrol yeah I think we downloaded it when it first came out yeah there's a new one that premiered uh yeah Grayson's not quite old enough to watch it in theaters and okay but he I don't know which ones he's watching he watches Paw Patrols constantly constantly that's the only thing he watches


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** Liliana's a huge Sky fan.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** Liliana's my daughter, for those who might not know.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:01]** She's six.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** She's beautiful.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:02]** I love her.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:06]** Sky is her favorite character, and she was quite just before the movie.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Anyway, that has nothing to do with Halloween.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** Kelly, how did you spend Halloween?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:11]** It does.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:13]** And Kelly went as...

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** Who did you go as from Paw Patrol, Kelly?

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** Say Marshall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:18]** Hold on.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** Let me find out.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** I got something from Paw Patrol real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:28]** Grayson makes me read for literally the last full year, every night, Paw Patrol saves Christmas.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:37]** And there's a scene in there where Skye points out Santa drops his gifts and the gift of bags, bag of gifts in the tree.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** And Skye's like, oh, I found it.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:41]** And Marshall goes up on a ladder to get it.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** Marshall's another pup.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** And he falls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** He's a Dalmatian fire pup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:48]** Yeah, he's the fire pick, and he can't reach it, so they fall, but the bag comes to.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:57]** The next page, Chase, who is the cop pup, shoots a web and catches the bag, but not Marshall.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** And so Marshall hits the snow.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:02]** And the first time I read that, I was like, wow, Chase is kind of mean.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:08]** And now every time we read it for the last year, every night, Grayson goes, Chase is kind of mean.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** It sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:13]** Did you say that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:16]** Does the cop arrest them for breaking an entry?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:24]** Kelly, I feel like you're giving big, I don't know, Rocky energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:30]** Actually, I was just Googling the cast of them, and I landed on Rocky.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:34]** Rocky is one of the seven main protagonists in the Paw Patrol series.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:36]** He's a male mixed breed eco pup, whatever the hell that means.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:37]** Is he an eco terrorist?

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** Don't lose it, reuse it.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:40]** And the fifth member of the Paw Patrol.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** It is unknown what his true breeds are.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** Oh, okay.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** He's the recycle pop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** Zack Snyder pop patrol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:50]** It's because he's recycled that you don't know what his origins are.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** You had no idea what he was.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** I guess I kind of get it.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:56]** His primary purpose is to use recycled items to fix broken objects such as water towers.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:56]** All right.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** That's cool.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** I think Rocky's one of my favorites.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:00]** I was him, I guess, for Halloween.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:01]** Sure.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** He's cool, man.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** He's not mean like Chase.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** Yeah.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** Chase is rude.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:12]** Chase has too much main character energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:16]** All cop dogs are b******.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Should we cut that or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:21]** That's a joke.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** For legal reasons, this is a joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:29]** Man, how deep down can we go this Paw Patrol lore right here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:34]** So it's New Hampshire, it's Vermont, and now it's police dogs.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:38]** They're kind of mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:43]** The police dogs just come up to you, they're like, him, he's got the s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:46]** To be fair, it's only Chase from Paw Patrol.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:49]** I'm not trying to stereotype all canine units.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:53]** It's just the cartoon, the children's cartoon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:57]** Judging by not by the position.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:03]** Meanwhile, I'm like the hippie dog who's just like, yo, bro, recycle.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:06]** And then I just get arrested.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:10]** Hey, man, you want to go hang out behind the bleachers real quick?

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Just to relax.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:15]** He does look like he does smoke some pot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Who's the builder dog?

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:17]** Rubble.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** Rubble?

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:18]** Rubble.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** That is 100% rubble.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** He's a bulldog.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:27]** He's like, he's the Seth Rogen of the entire troop.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** He's also like food obsessed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:35]** So like the Christmas one, Ryder's putting popcorn around the tree and Rubble's like, ooh, that's food.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:39]** Anyway, I love that.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:43]** Any other things that happened during the Halloween season?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** Yeah.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:54]** Friday the 13th fell in October this year, and I watched Jason Voorhees, or I should say not Jason Voorhees,

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** for the very first time.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:56]** Spoiler alert.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:01]** Yeah, spoiler alert if you've never seen Friday the 13th from the 1980s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** I've actually never seen it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** I've never seen it either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:07]** Spoilers have a 50-year statute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:10]** You're supposed to have a much shorter statute of limitations than 50 years.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** It's like the copyright laws.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:14]** It lasts for 150 years or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:20]** Depending on if you're a news outlet on social media, it could just be the next day when they post the big spoiler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** Even like...

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:27]** Star Wars drops their like spoilers on the next page or the page on the next day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:29]** They're like, can you believe this character showed up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:32]** And it's just a screenshot of the character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:34]** By the way, no one talk about Ahsoka spoilers, please.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** I still haven't seen it.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** I'm going to see it soon.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** Don't say anything.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:40]** The final episode came out like two months ago.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:40]** Don't even say it's good.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** I don't want to hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** It's good.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:43]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** All right.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:45]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:49]** So like we were saying about the Spider-Verse movie.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:49]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:50 - 00:14:16]** don't know i'm it's my fault but don't spoil that or paw patrol or anything else i need to like you know see them in the future this is this is the thing for me i'm an f1 fan but like being an f1 fan in the states you either have to like sacrifice your entire sleep schedule to watch races or like stay away from the entire internet for as long as it takes for you to re-watch it

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:24]** By the way, if you try to look up what time the race starts because you don't know and the race is over, you will absolutely get everything spoiled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** That sucks.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** F1 is the best, though.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** It's very cool.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:29]** Yeah, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:32]** I actually just got EA Play yesterday, so I can...

## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:55 - 00:15:02]** Austin, Miami, and Vegas is the new one.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:02]** That's right.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:08]** It's going to be a shit show this year because they're doing it on the strip.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:12]** Dude, the Las Vegas fear is funny.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** It is spectacular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** It looks really cool, too.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:19]** There was this one TikTok I saw of someone who was just like, all right, I'm going to hit this drive.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:21]** And then they, like, you know, golfed or whatever the fuck you say.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** I've actually golfed, and I don't even know the term.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** But, like, you know, they hit a ball.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** And then, yeah, with a driver.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:31]** And then, like, the face, like, was just like, ooh.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** Like, it got all, like, really excited.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:34]** Like, they timed it, like, perfectly.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Like, just over the horizon.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** It's cool.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:37]** Check out the sphere.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** Yeah, it's very cool.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** It's creepy, but cool.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** Kelly, what shadows do you have?

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:43]** Oh, okay.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** So this game is about to start.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** Every now and again.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:49]** I know, it's sad.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:54]** I'm going to do one quick pitch for Shaqtoberfest.

**[00:15:54 - 00:16:00]** Shaqtoberfest is happening here in the general area that I live, which I won't say where it is, but you'll know if you look it up.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** Shaqtoberfest.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:06]** For some reason, Shaq has his own Oktoberfest, but it's not really Oktoberfest.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:10]** It's just like a giant amusement park thing on the Queen Mary.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** So check that out.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:36]** and uh yeah my shout out for today is uh for glen bob 509 who glen bob has been a pretty regularly contributing rules lawyer and we never mentioned him like ever like i don't know like i think anyway glen bob yeah i know glen bob 509 i i disagree with that he's the one that gives me the most crap about being a murder bot i don't like him uh keep keep commenting then glen bob because it's always fun for us to hear i'm just kidding glen bob yeah

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:39]** So he may not be a he.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:39]** I don't know.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** Let us know what you are.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:48]** Also, your icon is some anime girl with... I don't know what this is.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:52]** It looks like it's from some Gundam show or something like that.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:56]** Anyway, thanks for being a rules paralegal and helping us out with the rules.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:56]** Thank you.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** And thank you for listening to the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** And for listening.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:02]** And participating on our Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:07]** And we invite you all to invest some time in our Discord.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** What's the URL for that again?

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:12]** Discord.willsavethepodcast.com


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Discord.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** We'll say the podcast.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** Yeah.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:15]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** It's a great place to hang out.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:23]** Now I'm going back to Rick's not a murder bot channel and reading all of Glenn Bob's comments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:24]** Wow.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** Oh, what are they?

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:28]** Just call him out.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** Rick's.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** Rick's not a murder bot.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:33]** Glenn Bob said, no, Kevin, you will never escape it.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** It's a meme now, and they live forever.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:39]** I read a study the other day that murder bots often have an addiction to Dr. Pepper, though the study's inconclusive.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:41]** Is their causation or just a correlation?

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** I'm still happy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:45]** They're like Bender robots from Futurama.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:50]** They used to run on alcohol, and now they just purely run on sugar syrup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** Some throwbacks.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:53]** Do murder bots dream of electric slaughter?

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** That's a good one.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** Did he do that?

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:59]** Tell us your... I don't know what you are.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** I'm trying to get into Discord right now.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:03]** I want to appreciate Glen Bob.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** I also want to shout out Adam.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** He hits such a good zinger.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:11]** And I'm waiting for Discord to open so that I can read it.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** Hang on.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:12]** Hang on.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:12]** Hang on.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:13]** I'm almost there.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:15]** You're going to read his songs?

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** I'm going to read his zinger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** Oh, zinger.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:19]** I think he said zinger because he's...

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** He's a musician.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** I was like, I didn't know he sang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** Adam.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** How do I just look at his?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** That's Adam from STF, right?

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** Adam from STF.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:29]** Adam from Strange Table Fellows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** Strange Table Fellows, another podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Thank you for listening.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:33]** Thank you for being a supporter of our show.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:37]** Also, fantastic criticism of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:59]** yeah he's we also like it when he plays this though that's good too he's a great critic uh and that is not i like thoughtful critiques yes it's fair he's not he's not like a chase critic you know kind of mean right yeah he's more like a he's more like a rocky i'd say he's like nice and like sensible i've never watched mob patrol


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** I've never seen it either.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:06]** I like how Glen Bob literally asks for advice sometimes from Rick.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:09]** He's like, where's the best place to shoot a vest for the fastest kill?

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** That's a good question.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** Oh, that's what it was.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** Thanks for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:15]** If anyone needs the clear-cut rules, answer in response to a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:15]** Oh, come on.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:17]** Why did this happen?

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** No, I know where this is going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** It's Mr. Kelly.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** I bought a level 7 item.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:22]** What a cast magic missile.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** Can't Shad be a fully evolved Pokemon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** That was pretty choice.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:34]** I died.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:39]** I have other contributions to the pod, but the rules is not nice.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** It's not one of them?

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:40]** No.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:41]** Yeah.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:48]** I think what I'm going to do is one day I'm going to actually try to understand the rules.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** That's what I'm going to do.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:54]** And then I'll have some charts up here, like 30 monitors with all the rules, all those of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:58]** It was such a good, such a well thought out.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** Such a great summary.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** There's no fat on that joke.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:03]** You need every single word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:06]** My favorite part for sure was like the Chad.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:10]** Can Chad be a fully leveled up Pokemon or whatever?

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:12]** That was for sure my favorite part.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** Thanks for the burn, Adam.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:15]** I appreciate it.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:19]** I like your compliments and burns.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:21]** It's always good to have the one, too.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** So, appreciate it.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** Well, that's good.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** I don't know where John is.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:29]** I was going to say, I think we've lost our fearless leader.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** I think we lost John.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:32]** We've played it out for as long as we can.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:32]** He's GMing.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** All right, I'm going to be the GM now.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:34]** All right.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:37]** All right, so I'm going to drop off.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:39]** I'm your temporary GM, Kelly Gilliam, today.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:44]** We're going to be doing our fourth episode of Starship Combat.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** Is that right, everyone?

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:47]** I think it's the third.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** Third episode of Starship Combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** That first one was just like an intro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:50]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:53]** It was just like an intro, and you guys did a really good job, I have to say.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:56]** And also, Will, I appreciated your role-playing of Koniko.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** That was pretty nice and accurate.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** All right, cool.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** Let's see if I can continue.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:02]** Oh, we put on GM glasses.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** Yeah.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** All right, so...

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:10]** I think you guys are just like 12 points away from like murdering these gray .

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:11]** So that's good.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:12]** What round are we on?

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Round six.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** I literally, oh, there's John.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:18]** Hey, John.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** You don't know the rules well enough to cheat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:25]** You should've just been like, oh, we're on the piloting round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** And then we were rolling it.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:31]** You guys all have Forneum Venomcasters for your, it should have a range of 50 hexes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:36]** Everyone has level seven Forneum Venomcasters now, and you can shoot them across space at the grays.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** That's like your new ability.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** This blooper reel is gonna be so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** Well, I'm just gonna shoot to kill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** What do you got?

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:46]** What do you got?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** Oh, that's a two on the die.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** But I have a plus 28.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** I'll let you know that that hits.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:52]** Yes!

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** You got it.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** Roll for damage.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** All right, all right.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** Damn.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** Eight.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** Okay.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** I mean, you did eight damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** That's pretty good.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** Oh, it blows up.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Oh, my God.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** The greys are gone.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:06]** They're dead.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:06]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:08]** The conspiracy is over.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:09]** Good job.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:11]** By the way, I'm going to reveal the entire conspiracy now.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** It was all Rick from the very start.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:15]** What?

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** Rick turns around.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:19]** All right, Kevin, do your thing that you were going to do.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:19]** What thing?

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:22]** The thing that we talked about where you go around and kill all your teammates in cold blood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** I didn't agree to this.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** Welcome back, John.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:29]** I don't know if you heard, but we already defeated the Greys.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:35]** Yeah, we... Like, we defeated all of the Greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Yeah.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** They were all bunched up in that one ship.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** I don't know what happened.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:42]** I'm just gonna tell you that my computer, like, f***ing cycled three times.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:46]** It just, like, was like, kush, kush, kush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** Critical failure.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:47]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:49 - 00:23:14]** all right well now that all the grays are defeated i mean what are we doing here yeah we're yeah this is uh this is the game plus mode where you go back you get to do all the the cool side quests that you didn't have to worry about right all right all right let's get going does anybody have anything else to say that they want to say peanut butter before i jump into something thank you okay

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:17]** Let the record state that Kevin said peanut butter.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** It's dark in there.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** Will said it's dark in there.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:24]** Okay.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** Dark chocolate peanut butter cups.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:30]** Okay, dark chocolate peanut butter cups.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** Is there anything else that anyone wants to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:35]** Are we just talking about all our favorite candies we got from our kids last night?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** No.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** We are definitely not doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:44]** I went around dressed as Martin Luther nailing stuff on people's doors.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:51]** All my complaints against them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:54]** I'm going to say this because I don't want to forget it for next episode.

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:01]** I want opinions on the Jimmy Kimmel I ate all my kids ice cream candy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:02]** Do they still do those?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:06]** Let's talk about it next week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** Next week on We'll Say It.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:10]** Just close your eyes for a second.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** Kelly, you especially.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** Picture a black screen.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:20]** In front of you the words text appears.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** It says

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** Into the Spider-Verse and Ahsoka spoilers.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:30]** All right, you can open your eyes.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:32]** I've just given you all the spoilers.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** Oh.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:35]** Nice.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** Don't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:36]** Quick recap.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** Our travelers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:40 - 00:25:04]** turned into starship combatants as they faced the gray ship that paralyzed your progress through the drift, one, abducted you, two, experimented on you, three, brainwashed your crewmates to attack you, four, and have been dogging you seemingly every step of this journey.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** Why did they do this?

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:05]** Why you?

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** Who knows?

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:10]** So you decided once and for all, you're like, you know what?

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:15]** I'm going to get out from under their shadow, literally and figuratively, and face the ship.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:23]** And the battle was starting to go your way as each one of you really dug into your roles.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:25]** With...

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** I believe, let's see what happened.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:37]** There was a, I put in my notes, see below, and then I scrolled below, and then there's nothing in my notes that said about what you guys happened.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:39]** So you did awesome stuff.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** Thank you, me.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:43]** Thank you, John.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:44]** Yeah, you're great.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** You're really good.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:49]** I do recall that there were some missed shots by Kev.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:52]** I do recall that Dr. Okay was awesome.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:55]** There was some great support from Colin and from Hears.

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:05]** I believe that Kaniko, as played by Dr. Okay, or played by Will, played by Dr. Okay, played by Will, playing Kaniko, was fantastic.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** And then at the end...

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:14]** When Kanika was like, I will be morale officer and Dr. O'Kay jumps back to the engineering, they did damage to your ship's hull.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** We're in round six.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:26]** Dr. O'Kay witnesses firsthand the glitching critical engines that slammed into the ship as I press the music button here.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** And we're gonna go back.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:32]** I'm gonna bring you guys back on Foundry to our space combat map.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** Let's get going here.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:44]** Round six, it was the end of the damage phase, I believe, when we found out that y'all were glitching.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** I think we're gonna move into round seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:49]** I'm excited because I can actually see the map this time for some reason.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** No, it wouldn't load for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** I see you, Grace.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** I see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:55]** You see them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** I see you, Grace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:00]** We need to go ahead and roll, right?

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** Or no, first we want to start with our engineering check.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:03]** Sorry, it's been a second.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:06]** Who wants to do anything on the engineering check?

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:13]** That would be Dr. K of Glitching Engines, or does Keniko want to do anything as a captain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** Pardon me a second.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** I need to pull up my cheat sheet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** Make sure to look in your journal.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:23]** Thanks, Foundry, for your handy-dandy resources that allow you to put in some cool handouts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** Well, I had to reset it, so, I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** That happened.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:30]** Also, don't forget we have our Starship guide that Kevin put in.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** Thank you.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:33]** I don't know who made that originally, but thanks for doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** I know.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** Nobody signs anything anymore.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:40]** I stole it from Reddit.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:42]** Okay.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:44]** So I'm into engineering, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:44]** Yeah.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:48]** And does anyone want Kaniko to do anything?

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:51]** Remember that the captain can encourage or add some bonuses to roles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** Right.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:52]** Yeah.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** Or does anybody want to change positions?

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:58]** I think take over the piloting.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:03]** for this round while Dr. Okay tries to lock down the shields, maybe?

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:11]** So I think seeing that we are out of range of... The net.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** Yeah, the net.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:16]** I think Colin would want to move to the magic officer role.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:25]** And yeah, I'm going to use my engineering phase ability called precognition.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** Oh, wow.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** Okay.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:30]** So basically he's he's going to be over Dr.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:30]** O.K.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** 's shoulder and like

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:38]** watching the Matrix-style characters falling down the screen, just like, Doctor, here's the pattern.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** This is all here.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** They're going to move there.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:46]** You should probably do this.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:56]** And so, with a mysticism check of... That's a nine on the die for a 24.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:59]** DC 10 plus one and a half by Starship's tier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:02]** Is there a Wilhelm scream in this?

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** There is a Wilhelm scream.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** No, it's Stormtrooper.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:10]** I feel like that was the first time I heard it.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** I'm like, okay, that happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** Excuse me.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:17]** The tier... I don't remember the tier of my ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:20]** Y'all are a tier 5, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:22]** Tier 5, making the DC 17.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** My roll is a 24, so...

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:32]** Dr. Okay, because I was able to use my supernatural senses, you get a plus two circumstance bonus to your piloting check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Good call.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Nice.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** Am I doing piloting?

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** Well, you're playing Koneko.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** Yeah.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** Okay.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:40]** Whoever is piloting.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:46]** Or if somebody else wants to play Koneko, that's fine, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:48]** I'm happy to take the controls.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** Thank you.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:52]** And her very curt and stern.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** Just to remind you that they are glitching.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:55]** Yes.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** Get it together, guys.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:01]** So I'm trying to think, what can I do?

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** I can patch, right?

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** Yes, you can.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:10]** So that's what Dr. OK is going to try and do to reduce the effects of the glitching.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** Love it.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Just an engineering check, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:19]** Yeah, it's an engineering check, and I believe it's DC 10 for a... It's 10 for glitching, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:22]** Plus 1.5 times ship's tier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:26]** So that would be... Which would be 7?

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** 17.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** Correct?

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** Yeah, 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** All right.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:42]** Just to set the scene while Dr. OK is doing that, in the middle of the drift, I believe that the Voidcrier is pointing down to the southwest and the Gray Ship is pointing to the east.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:49]** And you all are maybe, what is that, eight to nine hexes away from each other.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:53]** So you're each in, you're very close to each other's forward arc.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:56]** And it's a pretty intense combat.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:56]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:58]** What'd you get?

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** Uh, Dr. Okay.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:05]** In shifting over from piloting to the engineering, totally screwed the pooch.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:11]** He's confused and didn't know where or what is going on.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:14]** Uh, where, what am I supposed to be doing here?

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** And he rolled a one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Oh,

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** It makes sense.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** You get there.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:27]** You've been there, I think, for one round or just about to be there, and then suddenly there's like a blast and sparks fly everywhere.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:30]** You feel the air tingle around you.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:34]** The lights flicker, and you're trying to fix it, and the lights are going in and out.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** It's glitching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:38]** One for 14, so I don't think that does it.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:38]** Wow.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:38]** Okay.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** I don't think there's any critical failure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** There's no critical failure.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** No, no.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:48]** Nope, you just don't achieve that patch for now, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:51]** Can you go you have to?

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** Figure something out.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:53]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** Okay.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:56]** So what is the glitch mechanic do?

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** Can you remind me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** Glitching for any system.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Yeah, minus two to that roll.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:01]** Okay.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:01]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** Well, that'll be fine.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:03]** All righty.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** It will be a time.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** Yes.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** Let's figure out.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:15]** We're going to move from the engineering phase into the piloting phase or the helm phase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:44]** phase piling check canico want to give a roll and the grays will get a little and we'll see so she gets a neg does she get a negative on this one no uh just on the movement check so she gets she gets a zero a net zero so she got minus two from the engines glitching she got a plus two that's right yeah precognition right so copy to net zero so plus one because she has a plus one to piloting


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** Yep.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:45]** Okay.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:45]** All right.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:54]** Let's see how we... She is feeling okay because she feels like, okay, I have to do this.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** I need to get this done.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** And she rolls a 19 total.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Wow.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** Nice.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** Not bad.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** Out of max 21.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** Out of, yeah, out of... Yeah.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Brilliant.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:07]** As she is piloting,

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** Because we assume this is all happening.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** They got very high.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:13]** They started with an 18 roll on the die.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** I'll tell you that.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:16]** So they take the round.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** I think they've got us beat, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:21]** What do you want to do for your piloting?

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** So I have to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** How do you want to steer the ship, Kaniko?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** I have to move first?

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** Yes.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:29]** Okay, so she is like, I'm going to take one.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:35]** Doctor, okay, you were sort of keeping our distance and trying to keep them in a forward firing arc.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** I think I'll try to do that.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:42]** And so she's kind of go backwards a little bit.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** Can you go backwards?

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:50]** No, just watch, okay?


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** Dude, I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** I feel like Kaniko said that.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** Just watch.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** There is back off.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** That's what she's saying to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** Back off, Rogue-19.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:05]** Well, back off is a piloting check to move the ship aft up to half its speed.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:05]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:09]** She does sort of like an S with a little tail lint.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:11]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:11]** Okay.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:18]** Try to keep the gray in the forward firing arc while keeping some distance.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:28]** Because getting that distance is going to allow us to have more, hopefully, chance of, I don't know.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:29]** I don't know.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** It's a strategy.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:31]** Yeah.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:33]** Or the gray sheep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:40]** As long as we can maintain them within our four, out of our aft arc, we should be able to hit them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:43]** Speaking of, Rick.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:46]** I'm going to come over here and calibrate your systems for a second.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:49]** Not your systems, but the ships.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** So range finding.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** I'm going to help with this.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:57]** So I got to use multiple ship systems to triangulate that ship.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** And got it.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:06]** So next time you'll have a one plus one bonus to your attack roll, which, yeah, that'll help you out a little bit, eh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** Thank you, Hears.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** You're welcome, man.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Well, that was cool.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:11]** I like that.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:28]** As that is happening, Kaniko sees the gray ship also move in a bit of an S pattern to move up into your, I guess what would be your starboard arc, right?

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:32]** They moved into our starboard arc.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:34]** I still have targeting ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Fire away.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:36]** Okay.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:40]** You are in their forward arc.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:42]** And they are in your starboard arc.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:45]** What's going to happen on the gunnery round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:47]** Anything else happening in this check?

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** What is our starboard shields looking like?

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:49]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:52]** Starboard shields are at zero.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:52]** Oh.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** If you recall, that's where they've hit you before.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:58]** So it seems like they are just... They're working the body.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** They are a dog with a bone.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:00]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** They're going in.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** Working the body, as they say.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:04]** I don't know who they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** Get ready to re-roll characters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:12]** Cool.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** All right.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** What's it going to be?

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:16]** I think you roll first.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:19]** Technically, it doesn't matter because they happen at the same time.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** But for... What are we doing?

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:21]** The gunnery round?

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** We are on the gunnery round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** I have the target in the starboard arc.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:30]** Starboard is... I will use a light particle beam to attack them.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** They are within 10 hexes.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:38]** Oh, that's a 13 on the die, so 23 to hit.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:38]** Wow.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Yeah, that's a hit.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:40]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:42]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Wow.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** Wow.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:45]** Nice.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** Nicely done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** That's three D6s.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Could this be it?

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** Could this be it?

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** It's a one.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** Could this be it?

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** Could this be it?

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** Another one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:59 - 00:36:59]** Another one.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:00]** And a six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:04]** So eight points of damage to their forward arc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:04]** Wow.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:04]** Okay.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** All right.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Eight points of damage.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** Eight points of damage.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:16]** You see that it breaks through their forward shield.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** And then...

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** hits the hull.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:29]** I don't think that they take critical damage because they take it at every interval of what they were at before, and they are not at that interval yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** I've made contact.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** It appears as if their forward shields are down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** Good job.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** Nice.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:35]** They are down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** Great shot, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** They are down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** We've got to rebalance our shields, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** They rolled a 22 on you with their life particle.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** This is going to hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:43]** That doesn't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** Oh, wait.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:49]** I think that... Look at that smirk on Kevin's face.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:51]** You're trying to pull one over on the greys?

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** You're trying to outgrey the grey?

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** Uh, that's going to be right back at you with another 3d6.

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:00]** That's 14 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** Well, that hits a critical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Starbrook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** Got, got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** So we were at... Alrighty.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** That was 14 points?

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** How many was that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:13]** 14 points.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** Yikes.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** We were at 36 points.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:16]** Whole points.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:18]** Okay.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** You're at 36 whole points.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** And we have another critical threshold.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:24]** Did we take off the three shields from the starboard?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:26]** No, we haven't rebalanced.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Sorry, how many shields?

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** I can rebalance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** I just saw... I see a three on the starboard shields number.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:34]** I see zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** I see zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** Okay.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:36]** Cool.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** That's fine.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** All right.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:38]** Never mind.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** Ignore me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:43]** I'll read balance soon, guys, because we're going to need it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:44]** Wait.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** Can you guys...

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** do a quick thing for me.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:49]** You see, what do you see on the port shields?

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** 15.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** 15.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** What do you see on the starboard?

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Zero.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** What do you see on the aft?

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:55]** 27.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:55]** Okay.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** That's really weird.

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:04]** Cause that's the starboard is not right, but the forward port and the aft are my shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:33]** so is oh i see 30 15 3 and 20. yeah so the void crier should be 30 15 3 and 20. okay how about them oh in which case we don't hit a critical threshold and we have 39 whole points that's what i was so make sure you're clicking on the void crier i am on the voice so if you would because what you may be looking at is the like void crier template double click on the ship in foundry which should be that instance that ship itself

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:35]** The title should be void crier yo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** Yep.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:36]** Okay.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:36]** Yep.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Cool.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:37]** Yep.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:39]** The title should be void crier.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** Yo mama.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** Yeah.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:42]** Yo mama now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** There we go.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** Oh, now we got it.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:44]** All right, cool.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** Now we're all on the same page.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:49]** So now we're down to zero shields and we have 39 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:52]** So we don't hit a critical threshold.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** Which is incredibly consequential.

**[00:39:53 - 00:40:13]** yes that's one way to put it all right end of round i believe that was actually five so now we are around six despite what foundry says good round gonna be round so are we still glitching yeah yes until we do so you have to fix it yep yeah okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** We're at six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** Anybody change it rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:18]** I'm going to become science officer.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** All right.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:22]** Doctor, get this shit back together.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:27]** I'll keep post here, but I need you to do something, okay, this round?

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Just please.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:30]** Thank you.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** Can you go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** It looks like you've got this handled.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:36]** I'm going to head back to the weapon systems.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:40]** Colin goes back to his mystic net.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** Sounds like you're going in for the kill here.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Got two people on the guns.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** Alrighty.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:49]** Anything else happening in this phase?

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:51]** This is the engineering.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** I dare you.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:56]** Grabbing a beverage.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** Grabbing a beverage.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:01]** This is not the time to get...

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:05]** A Fanta, a great Fanta on your way to the tournament.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** It's not a great Fanta.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:08]** It's a blood orange Fanta.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** Helps me focus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:13]** You mean an Akatonian orange?

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:29]** with the calm and collectedness given to him from Kanika is able to roll a 25 to patch


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:32]** to un-bork the engines.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:35]** Yes.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:39]** Okay, Kinga, you should have full faculty of the engines now.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:43]** But keep our starboard side out of their sights.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:48]** You hear the engines like... Yes.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:49]** Yeah.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:52]** It's a wankle engine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:54]** Dom's going by like... Fib.

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:02]** That's funny.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:10]** Meanwhile, on the gray ship, there's silence because they all talk telepathically.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** It's just classical music.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:23]** All righty, that is the engineering phase.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** Piloting checked.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** Head to head.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:28]** Gray Pilot versus Kaneko.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** What's it going to be?

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** Oof.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** Oof.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** Oof, he says.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** They got a 17 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:37]** This has been a really hard day for me.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:42]** She rolled out 11 on the die for 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** Rough.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:47]** Maybe the engine's coming back online, it has to readjust and kind of stay cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:49]** It sort of like sputters a little bit.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:54]** She like dumped the clutch too hard and it's just like, go!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:55 - 00:43:04]** You mean when you're a passenger riding in a... She's just cranny shifting, not double clutching like she should be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** Which means absolutely f*** all.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:09]** Like, let's be clear.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:25]** Koniko I suggest that you plant them firmly in the middle of our port Arc to prevent them from getting back to our starboard before we get our shields back up Okay, I can do that and so she's going to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:31]** Use the waypoints, please.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:31]** Waypoints?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** Use the waypoints.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** Wow, it's not working.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:36]** Oh, sorry, the waygates.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:38]** That's what I'm thinking from the Wheel of Time.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:39]** Waygates.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** I've not seen the Wheel of Time.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** Dude, I have to say.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** No spoilers.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:47]** Not that it's going to be a spoiler flashback like we had this time.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** It's worth it, I think.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** Okay.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** The series is worth it.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Have you read the books?

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** The books are, of course.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** I read the first book.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:56]** It was great.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** I started the second book.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:57]** It was also good.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** I just didn't finish it.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** There are, like, 13.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:01]** It's one of the ones where, like, Robert Jordan died.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:04]** Then Robert Jordan's son took over, you know.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:08]** But I would say the Prime series are good.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:10]** Dr. Okay, back to Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:35]** Doctor okay, it feels like Kaneko pulled a very similar maneuver and did an s up to the top left like it's kind of how you have to move if you want to change directions because and write somebody in forward view because We only have one maneuverability So you have to move forward and then you have to turn and then move forward and turn so yeah just turns out being this You know, I like it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:35]** I like it.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:41]** You see the ship try and keep up, because you moved pretty far, I would say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:46]** Distance is our friend here, Kanika.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** Good job.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** I'll try to remember it for next time.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** Hopefully I'll roll better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** Don't get these grays licked.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** I'm gonna lick that gray.

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:05]** They move as far as they can, I think, while turning to try and be, I think...

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:07]** Yeah.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** I think that's as far as they move.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:12]** They follow you in a parallel fashion and move up.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:16]** And I... We're now head to head.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:18]** You are head to head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:22]** And we are... I want to say we're five hexes away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:27]** You see a smile come across Cullen Eden Brand's face.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** What's that green orb?

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** Y'all.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:31]** Oh, man.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** They're about to get fucked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:32]** Kev, don't even.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** Don't even do it, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** There's a strange green orb next to the graves.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:41]** Like Kevin's little raptor comes out of it.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:41]** Yeah.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** I can book two.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** All right.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** We are in the gunnery phase.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** All right.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Hit him, guys.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Let's see what happens.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Hit him.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** After you, Colin.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** Wait, when was the helm phase?

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Did someone already go through that?

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** They already went through the helm phase.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:58]** Well, why didn't no one... I was going to balance the shields.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Balance shields?

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** Speak up, Kelly.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:03]** I did that to you, but normally... All right, fine.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** I'm balancing the shields.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:04]** That's what I'm doing.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** Where do they need to be balanced?

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** Starboard.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** All right.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:11]** I'm going to balance the shields to starboard.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** I would take some from the aft.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** I'm going to take them from the aft.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** Take it from the aft.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:18]** So, yeah.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:19]** Min 10% of.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** And there's the title.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:25]** Take it from the aft.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:27]** Take it from the aft.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:51]** all righty to do this i need to do a computer's check to ship the shield points from one quadrant to another yes uh and do it just says even depleted shields minimum 10 of current total sp in each so there has to still be 10 so i could just determine how much to do that with all right so um cool well so that means that there has to be two in the act at least right yeah is that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:59]** Well, 10% of their total amount or 10% of... I think they're fine either way because you can only put 15 in the port, I think.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** Yep.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** All right, cool.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:03]** Is that the max or are you allowed to overload it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** No, I'm 10% overloaded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:06]** So three.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** You have 30, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** I believe you have 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:14]** Uh, cool.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:19]** Alright, so, uh, my hero lab, uh, died, and now I'm back in it, and I'm gonna do a computers check.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** Uh, right, yeah.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** So, here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:24]** Right, and yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** Scrolling down to computer.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:29]** It's, what's the, uh, DC?

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:29]** Computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:32]** Ten plus one and a half times ships to you.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** So 17.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** Computers check.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** DC 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:35]** I passed that.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Hit it here.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:37]** I did.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Here's hit it really good.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** So it's good.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** And then he's going to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** He hit the aft real good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:44]** All right.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:46]** So I need to know how much I need to shift.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:50]** I can successfully shift shield.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** So how much do we need in a starboard?

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:52]** Is that right?

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** I can't see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:56]** Do we just want to throw it all in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:58]** 15, you need over there.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** Just tell me where to put it.

**[00:47:59 - 00:47:59]** I'll put it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** I don't have access.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:02]** Just put it all over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:03]** All right.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:05]** All of it as much as possible into starboard.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** Done.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** All right.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:07]** You're welcome.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** Nicely done.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** Okay.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** Your shields are rebalanced.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:17]** You're topped off head to head right now.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:20]** I need some gunnery checks to see what happens.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:21]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** I would like for Rick 19 to go first.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** If you screw this up, Rick.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:27]** That's a 20 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** Rick, no pressure.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:29]** 20 to hit.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** But we need to not die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Isn't Colin also shooting?

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** He is.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** Are they within five?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** They are exactly five.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:44]** I just need to find the mystic starship weapon rules to make sure that I'm calculating this roll correctly.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** It's your mystic modifier.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** I will tell you that they hit.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:49]** They hit us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** What did Rick hit them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:53]** I'll tell you.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:55]** I don't think it's my mystic modifier.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:58]** I think it's my mystic ranks plus something else.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** That's why I can't...

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:26]** why can't i figure it out without you i'll tell you uh gunner can use their ranks and mysticism in place of their base attack bonus or ranks and piloting and their wisdom modifier in place of their dexterity modifier to determine that so it's my mystic ranks plus by wisdom modifier so five plus four is nine cool yeah that's only a 14 to hit

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:30]** That is a hit from Rick19.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** Yes!

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:39]** I don't see listed here the forward firing arc weapon.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:42]** There isn't one specifically, I don't think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:42 - 00:50:10]** heavy laser cannon I thought it was higher than the other ones it's a 4d8 I can't keep going on about these but I can dice coins and this one is on the back there's a ship being attacked by a kraken and on the front is like octopus woman's siren thing beautiful dice I love them flip die from yarrow studios get them wherever kickstarter items are sold


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** How much damage did you do?

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:17]** They did 14 more damage to your front shields with their light particle beam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:20]** Six, four, three, and six is 13.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:23]** Four, three, and six is 14.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:26]** 17 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:30]** God willing, this is it.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** Four, three, six, and what?

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** 16 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:39]** I don't know.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** 16 points of damage.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** Okay.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:46]** You fire that heavy laser cannon.

**[00:50:46 - 00:51:05]** and you see it just hit the gray ship and just a there's a massive explosion as you have destroyed the gray ship yes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:29]** and that is our game that's that's my guy yeah i think it's important for me to point out that this is my first time ever actually operating a weapon system on a starship and these gloves are a lot thicker than i anticipated that's that's that's fine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:32]** It's in your blood, man.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:34]** Well done.
