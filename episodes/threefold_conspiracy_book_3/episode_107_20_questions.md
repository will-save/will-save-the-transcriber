## Speaker_0

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:22]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:24]** Welcome to the podcast.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:24]** What's up?

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:25]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:37]** I'm your flashing GM, John Swan, and I am joined by my fantastic crew here of Kelly Gilliam, Kevin Decker, Vinny Rodriguez, and William Garrett.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** How we doing, everybody?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:39]** I've been better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** Yeah.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** Why is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:42]** Oh, man.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** I'm trying to get through this milk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** What's our episode?

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** The time that you needed to get through it?

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:56]** I've been trying to, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:58]** The exasperation in your voice.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:01]** It's been a challenge, man, and I have health concerns, honestly.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:06]** I don't know what this blue stuff's going to do to my body if I actually drink all this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:12]** I mean, normal milk, like, it's not physically possible for a human to drink a gallon of normal milk.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** No, it's a quart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** Will is not a human.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** We already established that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** Right, but it's blue milk, so who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:19]** Will's an eldritch being, dude.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:24]** Sure, but there are certain constants, right?

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:29]** Will's an eldritch being occupying a human body, and there are certain truths about the human body.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:37]** You know, I took my kids blueberry picking last weekend and, you know, went to change a diaper and was shocked initially.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Blueberry is the worst.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:41]** At how blue my kids was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** All right, we can skip this conversation.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:46]** So I'm drinking Erotic City.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** Wow.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** That was a great filler there, Kev.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:52]** I thought it said exotic, and then my friend that gave it to me was like, read that again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** That was two hard left turns in a row.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** That was.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** I'm really sad about this, though.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** This is one of the best beers I've ever had.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** I love it.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** It is actually, it's called a hybrid ale.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:06]** It is a mix between mead, wine, and beer.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:10]** And it's from Pariah, which is a small brewery.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:12]** It started in San Diego, then moved to Maryland.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** The saddest part is this beer was free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** It seems like the most backwards move ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** Is it?

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:20]** I mean, I started in California and moved to Maryland.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:20]** Anyways.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:25]** Pariah, my friends came over and were like, here, take all this beer.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:28]** And I was like, oh, no, but I can't just take your beer.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** And they're like, no, seriously, we bought.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:34]** We have like 20 cases of it because Pariah closed down.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** They were evicted.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** And they had too much beer.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:41]** And they were just like, they literally put on Instagram, please come pick up some free beer.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** And my friends loaded up the back of their car.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:47]** And if I knew this stuff existed, I would have bought some more of it before they left.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Now it's gone forever.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** So I have to savor it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** Wow.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** How many do you have?

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:52]** Is it just the one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** I have four of them.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Well, two left.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** And then I had some other ones.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** I only have four of these particular ones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:01]** I was just concerned about chucking all this blue milk.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:09]** And Kelly knows my affinity for red root vegetables, beets mostly.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:12]** And I don't know what it's going to look like later.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:15]** That's all I was going to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:15]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** That's fair.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** You needed to find the dark side milk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:18]** Really?

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** Yeah.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:25]** Will, could you explain what sort of brand slash what kind of blue milk is this?

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** This is for our audio listeners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:30]** Recently, it was May the 4th.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** Be with you.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:37]** And, of course, my local grocer had blue milk on sale from Star Wars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** It's official Star Wars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** It's official Star Wars milk.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:41]** It's pretty sweet.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** It's pretty sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:46]** And it is very sweet.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:48]** It is candy-like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** Where does it say it's made?

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:51]** What planet?

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** It doesn't say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:58]** It just says inspired by Star Wars.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:04]** Thank you to those in the supporters channel who said, Will, you should do it.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** You should just pull the trigger.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:08]** And I'm struggling ever since.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** Thank you all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:12]** The import costs from Alderaan are ridiculous now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:35]** we talked we joked about it earlier like is the milk that bad like if you could you have just a glass of it and enjoy it because you're trying to chug half a gallon i would like no okay it's too sweet man i think it would go well in a latte i tried it earlier than that but i mean it didn't retain any of its blue uh you know mystical properties so to speak so right right um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** Will makes good lattes, though.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** I mean, I probably tasted good.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:43]** He made a good... With the weasel ass coffee, he made a really good set of lattes with that.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:43]** You know?

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** Yeah.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** It was really, really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** I made the best tasting ass coffee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** It was kind of... It really was.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** It was kind of nutty, and it was nice.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** It was really nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:52 - 00:06:00]** If you call somebody a weasel ass, like, it sounds like a... Like somebody who doesn't own up to their, like, obligations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** Yeah, who rats people out.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** Like, this weasel ass came around.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** You guys are like, no...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:07]** It's coffee that literally came out of a weasel.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:10]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:17]** I threw it through my espresso machine, by the way, which that was a brand new espresso machine that I have to throw out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:20]** It just got the whole thing away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:24]** I brought it over and he was like, yeah, I don't want to put that through my machine, man.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:28]** And then within an hour, he was like, yeah, I'll put it through my machine.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:30]** I guess he regrets it.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** That's the effect the weasel has on you.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** It smells like nuts.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:38]** It actually looks and smells and tastes like nut dust is the term that we use.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:39]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:44]** I swear to you it's actually pretty good and a latte is actually decent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:46]** I'm curious about the process of it.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:51]** A lot of people don't realize that coffee beans are actually the pit of a cherry.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** A coffee cherry.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:58]** So are these weasels eating the cherry and then pooping out the bean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:07]** And also, apparently the person who discovered it was because there was like very tight restrictions on harvesting coffee.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Really tight.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:14]** And this dude discovered that in the dung of these animals, coffee.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:16]** He stepped in and was like, there's all these beans in here.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** So he's like, I'm going to eat this now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** And that's gross.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** You're smart.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:24]** Like, apparently in London, it's 50 pounds to buy weasel coffee?

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** Come on.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** A cup of weasel coffee.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:30]** Bulls**t. Not all weasel coffee is the same.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:31]** Depends on the weasels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:35]** I was going to make, like, an imperial metric system joke there.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** This is what we got to do.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:41]** I mean, a couple of pounds of food there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** Their taste.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** That's true.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** That's true.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:48]** The Brits, like, have to import all of the anything that tastes good.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:50]** I guess they pay, like, a hefty fee for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** Did we already insult our UK listeners yet or no?

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** Because if we haven't, I'm going to add one more.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:57]** I feel like we haven't sufficiently insulted them enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:00]** You can't insult them by their food because their food's insulting them.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** Down with Thatcher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** I don't know.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:04]** I was down with that.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** Well, most Brits would agree with that sentiment.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** Let's not talk about T-U-K.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:07]** Right, Brits?

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Down with that, too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:15]** I'm still trying to figure out if this is an elaborate improv sketch or if you're literally eating, like, drinking weasel shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** No, they're actually doing weasel shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** No, we actually wrote the weasel.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:17]** We did.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:17]** I have it.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:19]** I have it here in my cabinet.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** It's a real thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** And it was truly good.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:21]** Yeah.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:22]** No, it wasn't.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** I'm jealous.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** I didn't get to try it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** Actually, it wasn't until it was all locked in.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** It was truly butt coffee.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:33]** Vinny, I don't think you're a supporter, so maybe you weren't in the supporters channel, but we were talking about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:40]** Which is a gentle reminder if you want to have input on whether or not I'm purchasing blue milk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:42]** The gentlest of reminders.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** Vinny is the April O'Neil of the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:51]** Like, we're all the turtles, and then Vinny's just like, I'm supporting you from, like, afar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** And then we have to, like, rescue him, like, constantly.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:58]** And I guess Finder's like Casey Jones.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** Kelly's just shitting on everybody today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** And I'm here for it.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:07]** Speaking of Finder, I want to shout out and welcome Finder to our recording session today.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** It's good to have you here, Finder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** He's not going to speak up.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:13]** He won't hear his voice.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:14]** But he is here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** But we swear he's here.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** He's not imaginary.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** He's a real actual listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** We swear he's here.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:22]** Okay.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** I promise he's here.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** Thanks for joining us, Finder.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:25]** You're awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:27]** Is the Finder in the room with us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:27]** You're always welcome.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:35]** Benny, just as an aside note, can you dress up like April O'Neil at Gen Con?

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** Just in like the yellow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:41]** With the trend of five inch inseams, I think I can.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:41]** Love it.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** Okay.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** What does that mean?

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** I don't know what that means.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:44]** I don't.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:51]** So, like, shorts in general as fashion cyclists left to right.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Short shorts are in.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** Short shorts are in.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:56]** So, yeah, I think I can find some April O'Neil shorts and a tank top.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** I will also.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:00]** April O'Neil wears the yellow jumpsuit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** Yeah, it's like a 40s jumpsuit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:02]** Is it a jumpsuit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:05]** I will still join you in the five-inch inseams.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:08]** Yeah, and you're a very tall man, so you're going to need a long jumpsuit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** And it's a low cut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:10]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** Oh, she wears?

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** It's really low here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:17]** Unless you're doing the one from the new movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** Those white boots might be of a tall order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:23]** Benny, if there's somebody who can get shoes, it's you, bro.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:30]** All right.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:26]** So, like, they're a dog up until the three, and then after three, they slowly turn into a cat.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:31]** The other day, my son was in a mood, and he threw a book off the table.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** And I shouted at him, like, don't do that.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:35]** Stop throwing books off the table.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** That's why I'm in therapy.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:02]** Vinny, don't say these things.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Don't do it.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:05]** You can just answer one or none of it.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:08]** Vinny's in charge of our financial situation, it will say.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:26]** And not a weasel.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:34]** I had some of the very first mitochondria that ever crawled out of the ooze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:38]** That ooze was actually just Will's hooch.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:53]** I thought you said something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** My high school was...

## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** That's great.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** That's great.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:13]** That's good.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** What were the other questions?

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** Make a model of your first car.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:21]** Please tell me it was a 4B.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:27]** I didn't spring for the Model A. It was the third year they came out.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** I was like, what is this?

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:31]** Never going to catch on.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** Right.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** It was either that or Seabiscuit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:35]** They don't even have roads to drive on.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** It was that or a horse and buggy.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** It's called Cobblestone.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:42]** It's fucking... Ed, who was your childhood best friend, Will?

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** Sorry?

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Who was your childhood best friend?

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** Um...

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:47]** Gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:51]** If you had to choose one of the greats.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Epictetus was pretty cool.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** Growing up.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:57]** Yeah, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:59]** Napoleon was a little full of himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** He got bullied a lot.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** Will, were you the one bullying?

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** He's the guy.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:12]** I did call him short once.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:14]** That's where it starts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:18]** And he was actually tall, believe it or not, for the rest of everybody.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:20]** But, you know.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:50]** I don't know what it is.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:55]** I feel like it's so unreasonable, even more than like the like living in your office kind of thing or whatever.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:59]** You can't expect that a five foot three person is going to be available at all times for your beck and call.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:00]** Sorry, what were you going to say, Benny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:07]** Well, I feel like every banter we have is just encircling this hill for Ken to drag us back to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:13]** I'm at the top of it just shooting at all your stupid.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:14]** Anyways.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:26]** Moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:31]** I will just say, I will echo Benny's sentiment and say that he was my childhood best friend.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** Absolutely.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** Hands down.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** On the show.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:36]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:41]** And I have to shout out the maker of my first car, which is the Volvo.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** I love Volvos.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:46]** I love Volvos with a passion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** Okay, are you going with the 240 or with the 940?

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:51]** Or is that too revelatory?

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** Should we just move on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** We should maybe just come back to this later.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** It's one of those station wagon things, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:59]** I mean, Benny also got to drive one of the cars, too.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** That's a separate story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:03]** Yeah, I mean, my buddy had a 240, and it was pretty bomb.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:04]** Right?

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:47]** You chose that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** Are we talking about you dying?

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** No.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:52]** That was a calculated decision.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:52]** Right.

**[00:19:52 - 00:20:03]** Just the, like, okay, all of these other characters were actively working to f*** us and get these nanites back to whomever.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:45]** Can we just rewind just half a minute before Nano Ventures, where we all left off?

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:54]** I think it was... Rick is in there with the doctor, but I just want to make sure we are clear on where the rest of you are and what your thoughts are at that time.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:58]** I don't know if John includes all that into his recap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** I've got that plan, too.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** Don't worry.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** It's that nice transition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** That's rule number 12.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** Ignore Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:17]** Next to play by the rules, Kev and Kelly.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** It's important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Wait for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:31]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:38]** The group, you all, you four, you're in a strange place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:56]** At the end of book two, your paranoia was centered on the lab that you found yourselves in after your entire reality aboard the Chimera shattered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** Will we ever leave?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:01]** What awaits us outside?

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** Is any of it real?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:05]** Well, no.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:10]** And then a hopeful meeting with Narla and Shay.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** Two stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:18]** That maybe, maybe it will bring some clarity, some answers.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:24]** But instead, I think your fears just found a new orbit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** Can they be trusted?

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** Are they another simulation?

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:37]** You leave aboard their spec ops vessel and you discover that you're on an asteroid.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:40]** In what region of space?

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:42]** Again, is any of it real?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** Is this a hoax, you ask?


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:44]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:56]** Immediately, like same day, you suffer horrifying experiences as you're abducted at the hands of the greys.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:58]** How did the greys know that you were there?

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** How did they find you?

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:09]** Then when you sought revenge on the grey ship, the stewards and the mercs, the Pyke's Peritons, attacked you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:12]** Is that planned?


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:13]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:19]** And now you're in a steward's base with the stewards who saved you and the mercs who attacked you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** And then fed you a nice dinner.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** But why?

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:27]** That's like, you don't have to answer, but like, why?

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:30]** That base also happens to be in hell.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** Did you make a mistake?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** The mercs apologized.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** And then now you have free room.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** I'm bored.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:39]** Eatin'.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:43]** Just got to answer a couple questions, which Dr.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** O.K., Colin, here's you did.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** You guys are pretty good to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** It's about to be Rick's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:54]** Before we get there, let's just confirm.

**[00:23:54 - 00:24:04]** Rick is still in the medical bay having an examination done by Silverton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:09]** But let's check in real quick with the other three before we get back to that.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** Dr.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:13]** O.K., here's Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:17]** I'm going to bring you guys over to the Tyrcalis base map.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:19]** Back into the threefold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** Conspiracy.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** You forgot the conspiracy part.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** There's threefold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** There's a conspiracy part.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** Yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** There's three conspiracy parts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:29]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** and here's you're in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** They're all folded together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:34]** I think probably talking with Sylvania.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:37]** Like a crepe or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** Sounds delicious, though.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:42]** I'm sorry.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:49]** So you're talking with Sylvania, the steward's guard, about crepes and croissants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:50]** Croissant.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:52]** What's your favorite croissant?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** Chocolate?

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:55]** Like a maple.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** I think bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** It's good.

**[00:24:59 - 00:24:59]** Colin.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** Colin is... Flaky pastry.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** Colin's in the gym, right?

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:06]** Colin's in the gym.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:10]** Yeah, Colin is pressing his anxiety out.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** That's right.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:14]** Someone else is in the gym with him, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:18]** Yeah, but before we... Well, you know who was?

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** Keniko Breeze.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:20]** She came in.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:25]** She said, ah, Colin, I've been meaning to talk to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:25:47 - 00:26:17]** it is now currently he's in like a squat room okay looking at at yourself in the mirror and you heard the door open but maybe you're just in the middle of a just film in the zone film in the zone headphones on but no music playing got it are we peeking into vinnies like real life yeah i think i think we are and and will and i just shared a moment of like yes of course yep


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** Also, mechanically, then you can hear things.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:27]** Kaniko's face kind of slides in behind yours, smiling, waving a little bit.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** Hi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** Can I help you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Wow.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:35]** That was impressive.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:40]** Hey, look, I wanted to talk to you.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** Are you almost done with your sets?

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:46]** I... She kind of

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:50]** Walks over and just says, How have you been feeling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:54]** A bit anxious, if I'm honest.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** Okay.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:06]** There's a lot going on, and I'm getting out through the iron, and he nods his head toward the rack.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** It's the way that I keep my head straight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:09]** Yeah.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** I get it.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:12]** I get it.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** What are you listening to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:15]** Nothing.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:15]** Nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:45]** oh i'm so looking forward to calling boy era it's happening right now like i can't he's in the midst of his glow up and and now yeah he's like i'm listening to nothing she she walks over and puts her hands on the plates and then oh my god whoa looks back over and walks over to colin just says colin i'm gonna keep nodding and i'm gonna keep smiling but i am gonna lower my voice


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:49]** because I'm a little anxious to hear something.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:53]** Something's been stuck kind of in my mind.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:57]** Something is not right.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:10]** Um, yo, do you recall, uh, yesterday when here's introduced himself to, um,

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** Officer Astara.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:16]** That's the Inspector Heard's right hand.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:17]** The Vlaka.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:18]** Hi.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:19]** Yeah.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:22]** He's quite excited to meet a Vlaka.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Yeah, keep smiling.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** Yeah, no, we're just talking.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** I'm going to point at the plates.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** Yeah, right?

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** Yeah.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:30]** And I'm going to count as if I'm counting.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:30]** Yeah, right?

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Yeah.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:35]** I'm just going to lean down and just pretend like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:40]** I just... Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** Whoa, indeed.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** There's that explicit tag.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** There it is.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:46]** Let me just pick that up right now.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:46]** Oh, boy.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** Excuse me for one second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:50]** What are you doing, Step Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** I've seen this one before.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** Look, she... It's on your hard drive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:59]** My solid state drive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:06]** Officer Astara is... She is aware of all the goings on.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:07]** Okay?

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:11]** And she maintains a pretty rigorous schedule, right?

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:16]** To ensure that everything is running flawlessly, right?

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:22]** Okay, here's... She never comes out to greet guests before.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** I've never seen her do that.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** Maybe that's nothing.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:29]** I don't know.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:34]** She smelled a little bit like smoke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** Did you catch that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:40]** It was like an incense-y smell that I smelled.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** And then she kind of like fake laughs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:46]** No, I didn't catch that.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:52]** And he like demonstrates his squat technique because he's like engaging in conversation.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** Yeah, and she's like thumbs up.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Thumbs up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:55]** Yeah, it's great.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** It's great.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** Have you met many Vlachas?

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** I mean, you're a doctor.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:05]** Maybe you... No, this is the first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** Let's cut away for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** Let's go back.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:16]** As we... As they're talking, there's a white flash.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:17]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:40]** trying to take notes here on this sexy scene as the light is passing by your eyes a few times left to right rick rick rick rick hey are you with me rick i think rick rick kind of reaches out and grabs and he's like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:48]** And then he comes to, and he's like, I'm so sorry.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** I apologize.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:52]** It's okay.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** You feeling okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** Yes, is everything okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:58]** And Dr. Nodin's head leans over.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Okay.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:02]** All right, Rick, just take a deep breath.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Breathe with me.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:06]** And...

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:10]** In and out.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** Again, just, it's pretty, it's pretty simple.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:17]** Why don't I just, let me just give you a minute.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** And if we recall, Rick and Bernice are in.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** We're back in the medical center.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:25]** Rick and Bernice are in there.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:29]** Rick is sitting in the corner on the bed in the corner of the room.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** Bernice is next to him.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:36]** Silverton steps over Bernice and walks kind of behind the little area.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** And you're by yourself for a minute.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** Rick, what are you thinking?

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** What is going through your head?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:49]** Because the last time that we cut away was when Silverton was shining a light in your eyes, right before the nano-adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:54]** But Rick doesn't know about the nano-adventure, does he?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:59]** Rick is uncertain about anything he knows at this point.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:06]** For all he's aware is that he was on a mission for...

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:11]** The Android abolitionist front.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:14]** And yet he cannot contact them.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** And he's having these glimpses.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:25]** He's getting these pulls from Akita.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** Something else.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** It's something else.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** It's not Rick.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:34]** At least it's not what he recognizes himself to be.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:47]** And so what you saw, what you guys saw and listened to in, you know, the nano adventure, that's revealing itself to him.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:53]** And so he's trying to make sense of this at the same time he's aware of it.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** You want me to give a perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:58]** Yeah, but I did not mean to step on your moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** No, no, you're fine.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:04]** There's only 16 on the die.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Hold on.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** I got to check Rick's perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:09]** You got to blow off the dust on that Rick 19 hero lab there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:12]** That's a 23.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Nice.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:21]** As your mind is swimming, maybe all these thoughts, trying to make sense of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:31]** The outburst that you just had, you look over as you follow Silverton walking behind kind of the privacy shield, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:36]** Where the computers are and your eyes focus in on something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:39]** Maybe it's the first thing your eyes have focused in on since the flash flash.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:48]** You were lost in your thoughts, and then you look over, and you zoom in on a data pad.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:54]** And you can see a little bit the data pad sitting, leaning against one of the computers.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** And all that you notice with 23...

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:11]** is the verification of a patient having been transferred from Tier Calis Base to somewhere called Terrapin Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:21]** The document must go on below the screen, and you hear Silverton and Dr. Dunn's talking for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:26]** And right as you're thinking about patient transfer, suddenly...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** Dr. Nodens steps around the corner from the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:34]** Ah, a drone.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** How cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:38]** Walks over, bends down next to Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:42]** Is this Dr. O'Kays?

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:45]** This is so cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** And then goes to- Yes, this is Bernice.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** To pick up-

**[00:34:48 - 00:35:09]** bernice and kind of tap on i recommend against that bernice recoils backwards away from a little feisty both my character i know i think they are he's pulls out a knife what okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:17]** I just love the idea of a suitcase holding weapons.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** I'm so sorry.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** I do apologize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:23]** Looking at Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:26]** I do, but I didn't mean to scare you in the slightest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** Silverton, back to the matter at hand here.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:38]** Silverton, I think for now maybe we put this check on hold.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** I want to thank you, Rick.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:46]** You reminded me just now that this could be, this might be a lot.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** This might be a lot for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:49]** Is there something wrong?

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** Is it something I said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:51]** No, no.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** I'm not looking to make you uncomfortable.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:59]** And it seems like that outburst... Maybe we can skip this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** No, I'm sorry.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** That was... It's a misunderstanding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:08]** I'm... Why don't you just take a minute, keep breathing.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:14]** I think actually that I'm going to need your help and all of your help.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** Kind of.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:19]** She references to the three of you.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:19]** I...

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:25]** I think maybe I can just ask a couple more questions of you and your compatriots.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:30]** I want to learn a little bit more about these insidious greys.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:35]** Silberton, why don't you accompany Rick over to the interview room?

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:45]** She gestures behind her to the open door, which is where you wouldn't know this, Rick, except from what Colin and Dr. K and heirs have said.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:47]** But that is where they answered questions.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:50]** Why don't you go ahead and accompany Rick into that room?

**[00:36:51 - 00:37:00]** And then, Silverton, if you could please take a few of these things and return this stuff to my room.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:04]** And she grabs the data pad that you saw.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Rick powers it off.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:09]** A couple other files and things.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:12]** She takes her data pad, which is she...

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** You've seen her always have it with her.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** And she hands the other one and a couple other files.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:20]** So can you just drop this off in my room?

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:27]** And then can you go please have each of the others go ahead and take a seat in a separate room?

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:37]** I'm thinking maybe we could have peers can come into here and try and make use of the briefing room and the guest office.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** That might be a good place.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:42]** And I'm just going to go ask a couple of questions of them.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** All right.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:45]** And Silverton's like, yeah, yeah, of course.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:47]** Not a problem.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:50]** Dr. Nodens walks back behind the privacy shield.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** Rick, I'll be with you first in just a few minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:37:55 - 00:38:02]** And Silverton gestures for you to follow Rick to have you go into the interview room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:05]** Here, if you want to just step this way, please take a seat.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:09]** There's a nice view outside of the base.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** You can see some of the lava there.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** It's a nice place to kind of relax.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:14]** There's a couch if you want to sit on the couch.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** That's not a problem either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:18]** Bernice is still going to follow, right?

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Okay.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** That's up to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** I thought Rick would have picked her up.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:23]** Yeah, that works.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:24]** Okay.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:27]** Can Rick do a second perception check on the way?

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:28]** Sure.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:29]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** That was a total of nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** You don't see too much more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:49]** Again, you know that that data pad that the Sheeran stewards worker Silverton is supposed to take to the doctor's quarters and then go back out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** All right, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:51]** I'll be back in a bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:52]** Thank you.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:58]** And just walks into the room and sits down on the chair and sets Bernice down next to him.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:59 - 00:38:59]** It's quiet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:05]** You can't hear anything outside, but you can sometimes see little spews of lava.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:09]** It's a little eerie that there's this violent, chaotic landscape outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:12]** And there's like the only cue is if you look at it, there's no sound.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:14]** There's no nothing.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:18]** It's like clearly separated from the world around it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:21]** Just a minute or two later, Silverton steps out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:27]** And Sylvania steps out of the way and Silverton steps in.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:30]** I think, Dr. O'Keefe, you might have been in Sylvania Square.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Silverton steps up.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:37]** Hey, here's and Dr. O'Keefe.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** Hey, Sylvania.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** She just doesn't smile.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** She just nods.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** Fine, fine, fine.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:43]** Sorry, it's a tight squeeze here.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** I know it's right at the intersection.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:46]** We've got to have everything right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:54]** We were just having a wonderful conversation about croissants and other pastries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** Have you ever had one?

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** They're really delicious.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:58]** They are.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Wow.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** It's like a full-bent bread kind of thing.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** That is literally my love language.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** If I could wake up to a croissant every day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:09]** I don't know where they're from, but they're really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** I don't either.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:12]** I actually order mine online.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Yeah, I do.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** There's a site.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:15]** Yeah.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:17]** It's called Croissant Central.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** Yeah, it's good.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** I don't know who sells them, but they're really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** Trusting Silverton.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:26]** So conveniently like in on everything and like, cool.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** I don't buy it.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:35]** There's no, there's no like good hidden foodie spots on this secret base, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:35]** No.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:37]** Sorry.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:39]** The bowling alley is always a place to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** I do know something about that.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** Hold that thought, Dr. O'Keefe.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** Hold that thought.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:50]** Hey, look, Dr. O'Keefe, could I have, and I don't know where your drone is.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** I think your drone's still back in there with Rick.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** It's fine if you want.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:55]** Yes, it's his emotional support drone.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:56]** Okay, excellent.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:59]** Well, if you need them to come join you, it's fine.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** Just let me know.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:04]** Look, Dr. O'Keefe, could I have you step into this room at points right behind you?

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** Could I have you take a seat in there?

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** What's this about?

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:18]** Yeah, so he leans into you and hears, so Dr. Nodens needs your help with some things and has a couple extra questions.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:22]** Rick, I think we're just going to skip Rick's kind of first talk.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:25]** I think Dr. Nodens has some pretty important questions for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:30]** It's a bit strange, to be honest, to be approaching me.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:35]** In that way, can you explain why we need to be separated?

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** Or what's the deal here?

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** What are you trying to get to the bottom of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Don't shoot the messenger.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** I don't know.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** I'm not in on all the secrets.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** I've just been asked to have you take a seat in there.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:50]** If it's all right, I'll have you go ahead and take a seat back in the medical bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:52]** I've got to be honest.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:55]** I'm not too comfortable with this right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** It's a simple request.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:57]** I got a couple.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** You tell a doctor.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** I think she has a couple questions for you.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** Is that all right?

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** I'm just passing along what I know.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:05]** That's it.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:09]** And then as soon as we're done, I can show you how to order more on Quest on Central.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:13]** Silverton, you want me to go into the medical bay.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** That's where Rick is, right?

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:15]** Yeah.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:18]** Rick's actually in the interview room.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:18]** I'd be accompanying Rick.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** No, you'd be sitting in the medical center.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:21]** That's all.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:29]** Why don't I go with Dr. OK first, and then after you're done with whatever interview you got to do, I can go into the medical bay.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** Does that sound good?

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:34]** I just feel like it's good to watch out for each other and stuff.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:38]** I remind you, Silverton, of the experiences we've just been experiencing.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** I mean, I recounted them to you, correct?

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:43]** And then we talked about how my antenna was all messed up.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** I don't want any of that to happen to anyone anymore.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:47]** And so it's kind of good for us to stick together.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** I'm not saying it's going to happen to you.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:50]** I'm not saying this is happening either.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** No one wants that to happen, Silverton.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** But I don't want to, like, you know, leave my friends alone.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:57]** I mean, Bernice is with Rick, which is good.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:59]** Bernice can come out and hang out with you if you want.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:01]** No, Bernice needs to stay with other people.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** And then I'll just go with the doctor.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:08]** And then after we're done, I'll go and I'll go and do whatever thing you want to do.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:08]** Is that OK?

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:09]** It seems reasonable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:12]** I'm just trying to tell you, we don't split the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:14]** We never split the party.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:17]** Silverton, we made it out because we stuck together.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:19]** We got to stick together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:22]** This seems kind of strange.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** But I'm going to go with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** Well, I'm going to follow them in.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:26]** Because I should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** No.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:27]** No.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** I mean, you don't have to.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** Look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:33]** Let me talk to Dr. Nodens.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** Let's see.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** Okay.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:36]** Just wait here for one second.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:39]** Yeah, by the way, Silverton, still looking for help with that.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** Oh, he's gone.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** My antenna thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:44]** Silverton, my antenna.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** Did you look into it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** Very quickly.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:51]** He's trying to say it with his antenna, but he's actually just shouting it down the hall.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:51]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** The whole time.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** The whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:58]** Doctor, I don't know about you, but I've kind of lost patience with Silverton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:02]** Well, there's I mean, that's perfectly understandable.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:14]** I mean, he's kind of being a little unreasonable, but if it speeds things along, we're not too far from one another.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:17]** Hearing a literal slug talk about speeding things along.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:22]** Lightspeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** Lightspeed.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:27]** When the slug is telling you you're moving too slow, then yeah, you're...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:49]** i'm so chuffed to hear dr okay here's again whatever do you mean no i don't know you're waiting there for a second you start talking maybe we'll go in the stupid room john you don't have to go in the stupid room bro


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:50 - 00:45:11]** silverton comes back out yeah look if it's all right i'd like to have you guys take a take a seat is that cool is that fine oh what is with these people yeah what is this like divide and conquer i know that they're stewards and they're kind of like cops and so this is what you do but you do this in circumstances that are like not kosher so i don't know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:16]** I feel like I'm being charged with a crime, but I don't know where it is yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:19]** Dr. Kate, thanks for taking a seat.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:23]** I think Dr. Norton's will be in in just a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:30]** I'm remembering that Rick took off everything because he was fully comfortable with the situation, and Kevin is not.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:37]** So it's like, I'm hoping that Bernice pops open with an artillery rifle inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:41]** She's going to give you a really crude melee weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** Like, desperado.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** Yeah.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:46]** Just, like, machine gun hidden away.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:52]** But, yeah, Rick is unclothed, or, yeah, unarmored and unarmed in this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** Here's, if you want to follow me...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** opens the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** Sylvania steps out of the way.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:02]** Silverton, I gotta say, man, this is very combative and not normal.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:04]** And I've dealt with stewards before.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** I've worked with you.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** If you look in your database, I'm sure you've come across this.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:12]** This is unusual behavior for people that are supposed to be your ally.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** You're treating us like we're under suspicion of something.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** You know what I mean?

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:19]** Look, I don't have any suspicion of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:23]** I'm just a croissant-loving Sheeran, just like you are.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:25]** I don't... This is so suspicious.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:28]** Look.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:30]** Just take a seat.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:30]** It'll be fine.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:31]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** It'll all be over soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** Where am I going, Silverton?

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:38]** If you want to step into the room over here, like, again.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:40]** Yeah, go and step in there.

**[00:46:40 - 00:47:04]** yeah oh hey doctor the doctor the doctor who doesn't look evil at all yeah he doesn't have the twisted looking face she literally has a scouter like a saiyan scouter on her face she looks like carmen san diego all right whatever right yeah what if we recall colin was talking with kanika let's let's jump back to that for a second look so you've have you met flaccus before


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:10]** No, I've never seen them in my practices.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:14]** Oh, well, okay.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** You probably know this, right?

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:18]** You've probably studied this, maybe.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:24]** Two-thirds of them are actually born blind or deaf.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:28]** Some, I think even some, both.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** This is a real thing.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:34]** So, Officer Astara is deaf.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:40]** But when she... The door opens.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:42]** Hey, Colin, I was looking for you.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:47]** Hey, Dr. Nodens has a couple questions.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:53]** I think about kind of like mouths the words, graze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:58]** He's like mid-hip thrust demonstration when this dude walks in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** Okay.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:09]** And I think Dr. Nones has some questions about the graze with the rest of your party.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:14]** If you don't mind, could you just have a seat across the way here in the briefing room?

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:16]** Just take a seat wherever you want.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** Make yourself comfortable.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:20]** I think Dr. Nones has some questions for you, if that's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:21]** Aye.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:26]** Is that where the rest of my party is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:31]** So they're actually going to be in a couple of different areas.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** Yeah.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:35]** But here and walks out kind of like leading you out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:38]** It's big pardon.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** Is this some kind of interrogation?

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** Are we being detained?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** Absolutely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** Absolutely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** No.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** You are absolutely not being detained.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:50]** This is absolutely not an interrogation.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** This is just...

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** A couple of questions.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** Look.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:58]** And as you walk out, the door kind of shuts behind you and.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:09]** Silverton steps up and says, I think Dr. Nodens needs your help in defeating the Greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Pretty odd way to go about it.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:15]** Not that I'm privy to this conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:22]** Yeah, I mean, that's tough because that's a cause that Colin could absolutely get behind given his experiences over the last week.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:27]** But also, to Will's point, this is not the way he would go about it.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** But sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** Anyway, just hang out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:34]** I think she'll be in a bit.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:38]** I'll wait as patiently as I can.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:39]** Got it.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:43]** Hey, by the way, do you like croissants?

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** He's so suspicious.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:49]** I'm a bigger fan of the pen chocolate.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** I don't know what that is.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** No?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:56]** But I love croissants, and you know who else loves them?

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:59]** My fellow brethren here, right?

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:00]** Butts.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:00]** Butts.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** Two peas in a pod.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:06]** Anyway, look, we'll talk more about this in a bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:08]** They're not real.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:12]** They're not passing the Turing test.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** For sure.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:17]** This is not how a sentient being talks.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:21]** Hello, my fellow adventurers, chums and chaps.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:24]** I also like, you know, delicious pastries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:27]** Esoteric pastry.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:33]** I am also a fan of pre-gap confections.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** I also like hot bean water very much.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** Hot bean water.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:41]** Let me show you this picture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** So you all are sitting in there.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** I'm going to need to hire a freaking lawyer.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:50]** That's what I'm thinking.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:52]** And I don't answer questions.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:58]** Colin's trying to figure out if he missed some signals in the gym there.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** I mean, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:02]** From Koneko Breeze.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** He missed his chance.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** He's like, oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** I should have...

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:09]** Should've got her datapad or something, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:12]** Should've gotten her pad address.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:16]** I'm all for it as long as they're not, like, traitors or whatever.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:19]** Then I think here they... I wouldn't trust it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:23]** Here's... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:23]** Silverton blocked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** Freaking Silverton, man.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:36]** Here's this, like, here's this trying to remember who has the... Someone in our party has an amulet that transmits things sort of telepathically, correct?

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** Is the doctor okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** I believe so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:39]** All right.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:43]** So here's just leaving the channel open, listening for any communication.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:47]** And he says to Dr. Okay, he's like, if anything happens, I'm here.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:49]** Let me know if you need something.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** This doesn't feel right.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** I'm here for you, man.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:53]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:56]** Yeah, this doesn't sit right with me either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** I'm keeping my mouth shut.

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:59]** I'm with Dr. Nodens.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** I'm not going to say anything either.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** Oh, fuck.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** I have to roll to see if I say this out loud.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:04]** What was the roll again?

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:08]** Thanks, Jimmy T. I can't remember.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** I think it's a percent roll.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** It's a percentile roll, right?

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:14]** It's essentially a 50-50 chance.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:17]** Yeah, a coin flip online.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** That's what I'm going to do.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** I don't have any coins here.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** Everything is in paper money.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:20]** For the sake, I think Dr. Nodens is going to ask each of you questions.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:24]** I'm just going to kind of jump back and forth a little bit.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** All right.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:25]** Hey.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** That was Silverton's voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:34]** Rick.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:37]** Hello.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** You comfy?

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:38]** Hi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:43]** I am actually very uncomfortable, but it's okay.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:47]** I understand the situation.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** No one understands the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** Sorry to hear that.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** Shouldn't sound sorry.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:56]** Rick, which packed worlds planet are you from again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:07]** I... I am... I'm from Akiton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:07]** Okay.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:07]** Okay.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:15]** Uh, did you move around Akiton a lot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** Interesting.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:19]** Akiton.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:25]** From what I can recall, I... I was not born in Morrow.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:28]** But last I remember, I moved to Morrow.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:31]** Do you?

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:35]** So you... My... Yeah, please.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** Finish that thought.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** I'm not comfortable with these questions.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:38]** I apologize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** That's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:46]** But just to be clear, you don't recall where you were born?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:59]** I am not... I don't quite understand what these questions have to do with the Greys and what we have been... Just stay with me for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** Where are you headed after this?

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:05]** Do you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:18]** After this as meaning when we finish with everything with the Greys and the stewards and everything else that we were... I was on my way to Absalon Station when we were abducted by Greys.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:19]** Okay, Absalon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:24]** So don't remember where you were born, but going to Absalom.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:24]** Okay, okay.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:28]** Dr. O'Kate, how long did your education take?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:37]** Well, I mean, one's education starts at birth.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:40]** So, I mean, sure, since I've been born.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** How about that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** Okay.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Starts at birth.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:56]** So, well, let's say for the sake of discussion here that during your time at school, right, at university, how long did that take?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:56 - 00:56:00]** Was that like a five-year program, ten-year program?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** That would be absurd.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:06]** A study program at our distinguished Javome University taking only five years?

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:07]** Are you kidding me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:10]** Right, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** That's so silly of me.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:17]** Did your family visit you during that time at all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** I'm not really comfortable with this conversation.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** What are you getting at here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** No, that's fine.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:26]** It's okay that you're a little sensitive about your family.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:26]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:33]** Nobody gets between me and my kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** Who were your close friends?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** I'm not...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:56:39 - 00:57:03]** prepared to discuss any of my known associates without understanding the line of your questioning not willing literally social engineering she's she's finder she's gonna like what was your first friendship what's your mother's main name what's your social security number are you trying to verify my backstory lady here's what years did you captain a ship


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:10]** You already had that information in your database, ma'am.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:12]** That's very true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:13]** I just wanted to ask you.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:14]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** I can't remember.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:20]** My memory is really fuzzy right now.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** I don't know why.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** Faulty memory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:25]** Sorry.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:26]** Question.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:31]** During that time, did you grant that role to anyone else?

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:34]** Or did they take it from you?

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** The role of captain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:41]** Man, I must have hit my head on something.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** I can't remember anything.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** It looks like nothing's really going to jar my memory.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** Sorry about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** No, that's fine.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** I don't know what it is.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:54 - 00:58:00]** Colin, how many times did it take you to pass your medical exams?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:16]** I passed the, it really depends on which licensure you're talking about, the general practitioner that I passed on the second time, but I'm not sure how that's relevant to hunting grays.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** Second time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:23]** Hey, you can just be a little clearer, like, we're friendly.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** Was it the third time?

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:27]** No.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:32]** Oh, so you actually passed on the third time, not the second time.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:32]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:35]** But... It was the second time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** It was the second.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** Okay, cool.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:38]** You did well, yeah?

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:38]** Yeah.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** Good grades?

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** High positions in student groups?

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** Generally, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:44]** Okay.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** What's this got to do with the grades?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** Any favorite classes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:49]** Um...

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:53]** Physiopathology was a standout for me.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:54]** Okay.

**[00:58:56 - 00:59:03]** You know, I've always felt like my calling was to figure out what's wrong and to help people fix it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** Physiopathology.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:07]** That was a fun one.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:07]** That was a fun one.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:17]** At what point did they touch on things like new approaches, like hypnosis?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:25]** That was a sort of independent research endeavor.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** Independent.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:29]** What's that got to do with what's going on here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:38]** Well, I'm just trying to understand more about the hypnosis and the abductions that you mentioned.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:44]** It's all, yeah, and kind of where those stories came from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:47]** That was a tactic I picked up on Accuton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:55]** Okay, so independent from any sort of curriculum or mentor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** From formal education.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:59]** Right, so on your own.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** Okay.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:03]** Here's, what are your useful combat tactics?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:08]** My useful combat tactics.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:11]** Yeah, really.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:19]** Yeah, actually, I did once read a book called The Art of Tactics by Thaddeus Bartholomew.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:23]** It's all about running away.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** Yeah, you can honestly.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** Oh, my God.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:28]** People very often misunderstand.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:36]** And I feel that like a thousand years from now, he'll be vindicated for his tactical know-how.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:39]** I don't know why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:43]** You know, some say it's even bolder to retreat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:58]** So to be clear, the theory is that you should remain apart from your fellow group at a safe distance away, kind of prioritizing yourself.

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:16]** theory is more like you should all maintain a safe distance and usually the enemy is kind of moving towards you at a given time and then you shoot or attack them from afar and then it might pull their attention back and so you're just kind of like basically taking turns kiting.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** Why am I telling you this?

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** Actually, I completely forgot.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:21]** I hit my head and I just completely forgot.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:21]** I'm sorry.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:23]** I disregard everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:25]** Absolutely fine.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:26]** It makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:29]** But you are away from others.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:30]** Okay.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:36]** Rick19, how many weapons do you own?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:40]** By own, I actually only own two weapons.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:46]** I have my primary artillery rifle, and then I have a backup firearm.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:51]** I have obtained several weapons while on the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:51 - 01:02:15]** chimera and uh was it correction omicron base by the greys oh the uh checks your nose outpost omicron i believe is what your colleagues said that's what they called it or if you're called that as my colleagues as being the the stewards no that have brought us here oh no you're you're friends party right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:17]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:18]** Can you clarify?

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:24]** So you have two weapons of those two and maybe others.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:26]** How many of those were yours to begin with?

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:28]** Right.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:28]** Two.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** I just told you two.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:30]** Two.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:34]** So you pulled none off of your dead enemies.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:34]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:41]** I just told you I owned two weapons that you purchased.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:44]** And I pulled several weapons off of enemies along the way.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:47]** Including the greys that we... Right.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:47]** Yes.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:48]** The greys.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:49]** Yes.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:53]** I am not comfortable with this questioning.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:56]** Can you please explain to me what is happening here?

**[01:02:56 - 01:03:01]** I'm trying to just know a little bit more about... And he's going to reach down and tap...

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:15]** uh bernice okay just right he knows exactly where the microphone is and he's just gonna tap it i just want to ask did you enjoy firing the weapons right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:43]** i enjoy being alive okay being alive if that answers your question we're talking about okay so so so so you were alive and the grays were dead right so in that way you did enjoy the process right question here's do you have a family


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:48]** Wow, I just can't seem to remember anything.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:52]** You know, earlier I kind of slipped and fell on this vase that was kind of shaped like my friend Finder.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:56]** And ever since then, I can't think properly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:59]** Here's... What's up?

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:00]** You can tell me.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:02]** Do you talk to them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:09]** I don't remember at family or not at family.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:15]** Something about coming to the space and something about the last several... I don't remember.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:17]** I don't know.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** I'm sorry.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:20]** I just can't remember anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:22]** No, you can't remember anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:24]** Yeah, this is highly unusual.

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:26]** It's a little troubling.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:32]** I've been debriefed by Stuart before I've ever had this kind of conversation or interview.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:34]** So you do remember that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:36]** I remember that.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:41]** It's called long-term memory loss, okay?

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:43]** I can't remember something that happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:43 - 01:05:04]** The more that you say it, the more that you think back, and there are gaps in your memories about if you have a family, about what happened before, about how many years you served.


## Speaker_0

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:08]** Dr. O'Kate, do you and Bernice talk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** I'm sorry?

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:15]** Do you and Bernice... Do I talk to my drone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:17]** Do you share thoughts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:19]** God, Rick is just carrying around an empty suitcase.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** Do you share thoughts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:23]** Yes, I talk to my drone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:27]** Do your companions know that you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:30]** Yes, they see me...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:33]** Talking to my drone, yeah.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:36]** Have you ever asked Bernice if she wants to be your servant?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:41]** No, she kind of just follows me around, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:47]** So it was her decision, too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:54]** I mean, she was... I mean, listen, I...

**[01:05:55 - 01:06:07]** She and my colleague have spent many times with her, and after his disappearance, I recovered her.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:09]** So I would say yes.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** She consented.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:13]** Okay.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:15]** Did you have many friends at university?

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:17]** We didn't cover that, really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:19]** Yeah, you know, I was actually quite popular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:20]** Great.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:21]** Okay, that's good.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:23]** Colin, again, quick question for you.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:26]** We talked a little bit about medical history.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:32]** Which of the Periton crew members do you, like, trust the least, right?

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:38]** Like, if I were to be, you and them were to be on a mission, which do you trust the least?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:44]** I'd say that's a pretty incendiary question, Doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:45]** Sorry.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** Didn't mean for it to be.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:50]** Sometimes I'm just a little clinical.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:51]** You know how it is.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:53]** My bedside manner might not be the best.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:59]** Which do you feel not the closest with, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:02]** I'm not sure that I could name a single one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:06]** Okay.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:08]** So it might be more than one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:37]** sure do you think it's because they don't like your friends I think it's because of what I've been through over the last few days I've got a lack of trust for a whole lot of people why are you trying to take a partner back Stuart Kevin your question


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:39]** Yeah, it's not really a question.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:40]** It's more of a statement.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:42]** I rolled an 8 for sense motive.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:46]** You should have been rolling that all along.

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:47]** Can I get a sense motive check?

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:52]** Yeah, it's... I'm surprised we didn't.

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:53]** I also rolled an 8.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:57]** It's going to end up being like, oh, they seem like they want to ask you questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:58]** I got a 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:03]** Dr. Okay, it seems like they have a certain, like...

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:11]** there might be an agenda... There is somewhat of a loose agenda about the Greys, but if so, they're starting really far back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:16]** I don't know how to interpret that.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:18]** Meaning...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:23]** Meaning, it's tough to see how they're going to circle around to the grays here.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:24]** But maybe they will.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:27]** Were you with Dr. O.K.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:31]** the entire time that you were on the... Sorry, let me check my notes.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** Chimera, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:34]** I'm feeling really sick.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:37]** Doctor, could I please get some kind of medication?

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:38]** Yeah, sure.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:40]** I'm not feeling good.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:41]** Yeah, sure.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:42]** Of course.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:42]** Thank you.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:44]** Some kind of nausea medication.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:44 - 01:09:08]** yeah sure and she actually reaches in and pulls out a small serum um and and starts to pretends to take it just throws it behind his head well no it's an it's an it's an injection and no what about um sorry nico orion i believe his name was were you with him may he rest in peace on the chimera


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:11]** I mean, drift beacons and distant stars.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:13]** I have to get out of here.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:14]** Do you have a bathroom somewhere?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:18]** Please, just take one second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:19]** I don't feel well.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:22]** I think I have a sudden onset of claustrophobia.

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:23]** Claustrophobia?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:26]** Claustrophobia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:28]** What's fear of doctors?

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:29]** Let's see.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:32]** I have iatrophobia all of a sudden.

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:35]** I can't even explain how that happened.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:36]** It just did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:45]** Colin, did you have any prior contact with your friends, Hears and Dr. O'Kade, before meeting at this outpost, Omicron?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:46]** No.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:47]** Okay.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:50]** No thing before.

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:50]** Got it.

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:52]** At an outpost, Omicron.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:55]** Does it bother you that Rick and Dr. O.K.

**[01:09:55 - 01:10:02]** found, I don't know if they told you this, it sounds like they found the room where some captain's body was stored?

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:04]** That they were the ones to find it?

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:05]** Does that bother you?

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:06]** They found it.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:09]** I'm not sure which captain you're speaking about.

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:14]** I mean, if you think about it, everyone on board the Chimera died except for three of them.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:18]** Well, I guess four, but then the fourth one died, right?

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:25]** Nico died, and then it was just three of them, and you didn't know them before you woke up, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:30]** No, no, I didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:33]** Rick19, do you have any affiliations with any other groups?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:39]** I told you that I am affiliated with the Android abolitionists.

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:39]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:40]** So that's all?

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:42]** Yeah?

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:42]** Okay.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:44]** Does Hears' time with the Free Captains at all concern you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:50]** It would if I did not know Hears personally.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:56]** I feel as though Hears has redeemed himself from that time of piracy.


## Speaker_0

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:56]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:57 - 01:10:58]** Interesting.

**[01:10:58 - 01:10:59]** It's very trusting.

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:08]** Dr. K, when you attack the peritons, would you characterize your aggression as extreme or mild when you attack them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:11]** I'm sorry, is that addressed to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:12]** Yes, Dr. K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:16]** And what was the question again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:19]** My... You know, that's probably not the best one.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:20]** Here's actually a better one.

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:28]** To the abductions, did it spark any sort of curiosity in you when you saw your fellow companions under scientific study?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:30]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:31]** I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:33]** No, not particularly.

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:42]** I enjoy... My expertise is more in pharmacology and fauna.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:44]** Fauna?

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:47]** Like... Flora and fauna, yeah.

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:48]** Like the suitcase.

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:48]** Okay.

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:50]** Sorry, no, not my suitcase.

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:51]** Like the suitcase?

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:52]** Okay.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:52]** All right.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:55]** What are you explaining to me?

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:57]** You're trying to say something.

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:57]** This is not a doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:58 - 01:12:01]** Did Rick share any concerns with you about his time on the computer?

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:01]** Here's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:04]** Hears is pretending to be passed out.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:06]** He's asleep.

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:07]** He passed out from the needle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:11]** Are you actually trying to be passed out?

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:15]** He doesn't... What else can he do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:17]** He's tried everything else to not answer questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:18]** Do you accept the injection?

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:19]** No.

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:23]** Sorry, so you are... I'm sorry, I'm afraid of needles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:24]** Okay.

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:27]** Are you actually going to try and go back to sleep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:30]** Here's...

**[01:12:32 - 01:12:32]** I know.

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:34]** He's not a child.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:35]** He's not a child.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:35]** He's an adult.

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:42]** So what he's going to do is he's just going to look at Dr. Nodens and be like, Doctor, I'm not comfortable answering questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:43]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:44]** I understand, Doc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:47]** Let me just ask, and you can answer if you feel like it, okay?

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:51]** Did Rick share any of his concerns with you about his time on the computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:55]** What's the star finder way of saying I plead the fifth?

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:57]** I don't know if there's some law that was created.

**[01:12:58 - 01:12:59]** You don't answer her question.

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:00]** I was literally looking this up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:01]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:07]** Colin, do you feel like you fit in with the other three, Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:09]** There's a bunch of rules on divorce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_15

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:10]** Here, guys.

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:14]** Reign it in for me.

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:15]** Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:16]** Wait, can I clarify?

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:18]** Do you feel like you fit in with the other three?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:21]** I would say that I do.

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:24]** Will enough to survive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:27]** Do you realize that your new friends might not be who they say they are?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:30]** I might not be who I say I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:38]** This leggy bitch and her inserting herself into our... Selling mistrust, but I have a question for you.

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:41]** Why are you trying to establish our background?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:45]** I would like to know a bit more about you, because here's the thing.

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:58]** I want to ask you, Dr. O'Kate, did you share your motives with your curiosities about fauna, flora, and things with your companions?

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:00]** Did you entrust them with that information?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:06]** They can read any of my published works and discover that themselves if they wish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:07]** Okay.

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:11]** Is it harder to trust them, though, since they're not Osharu's?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:14]** Um, yeah, but I look past that.

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:16]** That's very big of you.

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:19]** Rick, Dr. Oak is racist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:24]** I mean, I think Osharu's are mistrusting of people outside of the Osharu.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:25]** I just get that vibe.

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:28]** Here's, here's, you don't need to answer this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:29]** They're slugs, man.

**[01:14:29 - 01:14:30]** They're vulnerable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:36]** Just a question here's, did you feel any guilt about letting Nico go into the room, the room that he died before you?

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:41]** You said that you don't remember, so maybe just think on it, right?

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:43]** That seems like what happened.

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:46]** Let me think on it and I'll get back.

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:47]** That you let him lead.

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:51]** Rick19, do you know what the Grays are planning?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:14:53 - 01:15:01]** Why would I have any idea what alien adversaries are attempting to get from us?

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:08]** Are you insinuating that I have any involvement with what has happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:11]** Colin, can you recall for me your first experience with the Grace?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:22]** The first experience I remember was...

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:31]** After being abducted from your, um, the stewardship for that, I don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:34]** But are you sure this was your first experience?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:35 - 01:15:35]** You don't remember?

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:36]** You can't really be sure?

**[01:15:37 - 01:15:37]** No.

**[01:15:37 - 01:15:38]** Yeah, that's tough.

**[01:15:38 - 01:15:39]** Here's a question.

**[01:15:39 - 01:15:41]** Is it possible that you killed Nico Orion?

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:42]** Something to think on.

**[01:15:44 - 01:15:46]** Dr. O'K, what are you to the greys?

**[01:15:47 - 01:15:48]** Do you know?

**[01:15:48 - 01:15:50]** Probably inconsequential.

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:54]** Last question.

**[01:15:54 - 01:15:54]** Sorry.

**[01:15:54 - 01:15:55]** Last question.

**[01:15:56 - 01:15:58]** Rick, have you been feeling like yourself lately?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:06]** The actual answer to that is no, I have not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:07 - 01:16:08]** Not feeling like yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:11]** I don't believe that has anything to do with the greats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:12]** But you are alive.

**[01:16:12 - 01:16:13]** Like you enjoy it.

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:15]** You are alive.

**[01:16:16 - 01:16:21]** Can you be so sure that how you're feeling is how you are actually feeling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:30]** My emotions and my internal feelings actually have very little to do with what is happening here.

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:37]** I have been trained to assess things objectively.

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:38]** Yeah.

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:39]** And without emotion.

**[01:16:39 - 01:16:39]** Without conscience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:40 - 01:16:43]** You do enjoy, yeah.

**[01:16:43 - 01:16:44]** You don't remember some other things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:46]** I just wanted to correct what you were saying.

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:47]** I wanted to translate for everyone else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:47 - 01:16:57]** Honestly, Rick, you would be a great steward for the strength part, but the unity part, I'm concerned at your abilities.

**[01:16:58 - 01:16:59]** Do you feel like you trust yourself?

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:02]** It sounds like not.

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:03]** Am I right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:17:03 - 01:17:08]** I have full faith in the stewards, but at this moment in time, I have very little trust in you.

**[01:17:08 - 01:17:08]** In yourself.

**[01:17:09 - 01:17:09]** Dr. Noden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:11]** No trust in yourself.

**[01:17:11 - 01:17:12]** Understood.

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:13]** Dr. O'Kay, quick question.

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:14]** Last question.

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:21]** Did you tell the Elder Council that you're now traveling alone and that you've kind of failed in your charge to protect your mentor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:21 - 01:17:22]** Um...

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:37]** That's a matter of Osharu internal politics, in which I think we should keep confined to that space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:37 - 01:17:37]** Sure.

**[01:17:37 - 01:17:37]** Okay.

**[01:17:37 - 01:17:38]** Unwilling to share.

**[01:17:38 - 01:17:40]** Noted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:42 - 01:17:42]** Okay.

**[01:17:42 - 01:17:44]** Does it depress you to be without Dr. Boushdakis?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:44 - 01:17:45]** Last question.

**[01:17:45 - 01:17:45]** I swear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:46 - 01:17:46]** Okay.

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:47]** Okay.

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:47]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:48]** It's tough.

**[01:17:48 - 01:17:48]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:48 - 01:17:51]** Colin, I think...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:54]** I think you're different.

**[01:17:55 - 01:17:57]** The other three, they can't help themselves.

**[01:17:58 - 01:18:02]** But I don't think that the greys have desecrated you.

**[01:18:02 - 01:18:04]** Perhaps the greys might have desecrated them.

**[01:18:06 - 01:18:07]** Colin.

**[01:18:07 - 01:18:07]** I'm sorry.

**[01:18:08 - 01:18:12]** Can you unpack the term desecrated?

**[01:18:12 - 01:18:15]** We had a little offer.

**[01:18:15 - 01:18:17]** And I decided to take you up on that.

**[01:18:18 - 01:18:19]** And I'm going to share a secret with you.

**[01:18:20 - 01:18:21]** You are not alone.

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:26]** Someone on the parentage knows what your family really does.

**[01:18:27 - 01:18:31]** Out of courtesy, I haven't asked.

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:31]** That seems genuine.

**[01:18:34 - 01:18:38]** If there's a secret that you want to share with me now, go ahead.

**[01:18:38 - 01:18:39]** I'm all ears.

**[01:18:39 - 01:18:43]** Otherwise, that might be my last question.

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:46]** Other, yeah, the independent research part we can get to later.

**[01:18:47 - 01:18:48]** Any secrets you want to share with me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:54]** Here's Colin just blinks at her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:54 - 01:18:57]** Here's do you have a sense that you're destined for something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:19:00 - 01:19:02]** Can I have my puck back, please?

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:06]** You still have the puck.

**[01:19:06 - 01:19:07]** What's your background?

**[01:19:07 - 01:19:10]** I thought that you were a medical doctor, but apparently you also have a PhD in psychology.

**[01:19:10 - 01:19:12]** I had no idea that you were also a psychologist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:13 - 01:19:14]** I am, yeah.

**[01:19:14 - 01:19:16]** You can read some of my papers.

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:19]** Here's the thing.

**[01:19:19 - 01:19:22]** I don't think that you are destined for something personally.

**[01:19:22 - 01:19:38]** because what about your friend who died right the one who died to protect you like i guess you weren't going to protect them like that wasn't in your destiny really really upset okay i'm about to get up and walk out of here so you need to

**[01:19:38 - 01:19:39]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:19:39 - 01:19:42]** I think that's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:42 - 01:19:47]** And there are like kind of, I picture like four frames of her talking in different rooms to the four of you.

**[01:19:48 - 01:19:53]** Look, I do want to just go ahead and thank you all for your dear time, for spending it with me.

**[01:19:54 - 01:19:56]** It's lovely to get to know you a little bit better.

**[01:19:56 - 01:19:59]** I may have some other questions for you.

**[01:19:59 - 01:20:00]** I haven't decided yet.

**[01:20:00 - 01:20:02]** I need to go back over our chat here.

**[01:20:03 - 01:20:05]** I've noted down some of the concerns that are plaguing you.

**[01:20:06 - 01:20:06]** Right.

**[01:20:06 - 01:20:10]** And I will have some recommendations for you.

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:14]** So for now, just go ahead and please enjoy your day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:20:15 - 01:20:17]** Can you answer a question for me?

**[01:20:18 - 01:20:19]** What is Terrapin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:20]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:23]** Yeah, what's there?

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:24]** It's like a base.

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:26]** But like, where is it?

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:27]** Whatever.

**[01:20:27 - 01:20:27]** Station.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:28]** Station.

**[01:20:29 - 01:20:29]** Here.

**[01:20:29 - 01:20:31]** F*** you, John.

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:34]** F*** you, John.

**[01:20:35 - 01:20:35]** F*** you.

**[01:20:35 - 01:20:35]** F*** you.

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:36]** It's not even in style.

**[01:20:37 - 01:20:37]** It's a name of an album.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:20:37 - 01:20:40]** This is the most unhappy I've ever been in this godforsaken game.

**[01:20:41 - 01:20:42]** I don't know if I want to continue.

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:45]** F*** you, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:49]** I feel like we as players are going to need therapy for this game.
