**[00:01:28 - 00:01:28]** What do we say?

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:34]** I'm your Dr. Lee GM, and I got my patients here, Kevin, Vinny, Will, and Kelly.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:38]** And we have our nurse finder watching and attending.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:41]** A silent specter watching over us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** Silent specter.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** Yeah.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:44]** Not Batman.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:45]** The listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** A benign specter or a malevolent specter?

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** Do we know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** I don't think we'll ever know.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:55]** Benny, I have a very important question for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:59]** How often do you wear shirts that are red?

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:04]** That's what I'm seeing that is really cuing me in that there's something important going on in your life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** You know, it's funny.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:07]** I don't often wear shirts that are red.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** Is that red, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:11]** Seems like a... Salmon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:14]** It's like a... It's like a... Heather sort of... Heather?

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** No, no.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** Yeah.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:20]** Heather is... Is the, like... The, like, pattern.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** The, like, texture.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:21]** Right.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:21]** Yeah.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** Like, caring about.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:23]** Yeah.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** It's not really hairy.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Like a strawberry...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:31]** I'm going to start Googling all this shit as you guys see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:34]** Are we trying to avoid the fact that his shirt is pink?

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:37]** Is that what we're trying to avoid right now?

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:37]** Yeah.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** I got lots of pink shirts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Herringbone is not a color.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Where did you guys get that from?

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** Herringbone's not a color.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** It's a pattern.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** It's a texture.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:49]** But Heather is not a herringbone pattern.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:54]** If Heather was a herringbone pattern, it would just be called herringbone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** Yes.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** Or Heatherbone.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:59]** Guys, we've laughed a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:06]** Heather just brings up Heather Locklear and Heather Plant and Heather Thomas and Heathers, which is a movie from 1988.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** Whatever your search history is, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:10]** Do you know how to Google?

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** I'm Googling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** I don't know what to Google anymore.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:15]** With unnecessary Google searches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:35]** literally write heather pattern and you can find out all about it it's showing a gray like a like the slashes like a like and then there's a wikipedia with with yeah with something like this maybe that that looks like very sure you should update it with a screenshot of benny right now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:56]** yep yeah that would be heather guys um i need a joke because i want to laugh i don't got any i just say that no one can't force a joke yeah you can what wait what hold on finder said something he said something wildly inappropriate as well


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** We're explaining the whole joke again.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** Do one more time.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** Yes.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:04]** I only heard the punchline, I think.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** I couldn't hear anything else.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** I heard penis.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:08]** Okay, cool.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** We have our new imaginary friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:15]** I'm just going to leave it all that silence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:25]** It's kind of like telling a bad chemistry joke where you get no reaction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:52]** nope okay all right that was a good dad joke yeah yeah yeah we're a bit too noble for that before we came on oh wow before we came on we were like who gives the better dad jokes but i don't a better means worse to me because dad jokes are really bad and um there's and i think i feel like vinny vinny does the best bad jokes and also the worst for this reason oh instagram is bad jokes bad jokes not dad jokes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:52 - 00:05:11]** yeah there's an art to telling dad jokes truly like if you're gonna if you're gonna have a bad joke it's gotta be in the right time it's gotta have the right context like you can't just like throw a bad joke out there otherwise you're not funny but you can throw a bad joke in the right situation and gets a whole lot of laughs


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:17]** I feel like that's what dad jokes are, is that they're always done at the worst times and they're never good.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** But hold on, let me see.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** Wow.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:20]** Googling dad jokes now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:22]** I think he's Googling my dad jokes to see.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:25]** Kelly just wants to put me on blast, apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** VinnyDadJokes.com.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:31]** Is this the next Kendrick and Drake?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:39]** I've been hearing about that and I don't know enough about it, but everything that I see, I don't like to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** Drake is losing, just for record.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** Yeah, that's what I gather.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:52]** Drake came out the gate strong, but K-Dot has since... Who?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:55]** Why would Drake ever get into a battle like this?

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:58]** I feel like that's just not his... So un-Canadian of him.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:14]** i it's just no it's like even even a genre of music makes no sense to like get into like a district why would you open yourself up to attack like that i i it makes sense you would lose to be honest yeah i mean some say come on kendrick took the first shot and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:38]** drake was just retaliating but oh is that what it was yeah there's lots of videos that track the whole timeline but it's tough to keep up with because they're releasing like multiple songs a day in response to each other well i feel like that's the best uh the best feud then for creativity right yeah so it's very profitable for both of them

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** Presumably.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** We'll see.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:44]** I mean, we all saw what happened to 50 and Kanye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:48]** It's not going to make me listen to Drake more.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:51]** Drake is not in any way badass at all.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:56]** So then I don't understand why he'd be...

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:26]** put anywhere near any of the people that have been mentioned like you know uh or eminem or anyone like that he's not heather locklear yeah no it's just it's just don't get into wait what is heather locklear who the next is gonna get into a district you haven't heard about her or something like that she's gonna emerge out of the ocean out of retirement and then selene would own heather selene would own drake wow sorry it's just annoying to me any i because yeah i don't know it's dumb


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:48]** i'm trying to think if i've ever had a feud like that like just some beef in my life yeah got beef yeah got some like kendrick drake i can't air it for the streets though can't air for the streets okay there's beef in in the verse yeah i have beef i have beef with taco monk wow


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** My neck is getting tired from holding all these hats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** I think you need more hats on there.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** You got to pump those numbers up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** I know you got more.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:01]** I know you have more.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:04]** I can out-hat you just reaching over here, probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** I have three hats in my whole house.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** I have two more hats.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** Only one of them is black.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:13]** And I quite honestly saved the best one for last.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:14]** Yeah.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:17]** Way to drop it.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:24]** So for those of you that don't know, we have a channel just for supporters called Vinny's Unreasonable Requests.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:30]** And Taco Monk in there said, I demand my unreasonable request for you this week is that you wear all of your hats.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:38]** So he looks like a freaking general from like Napoleonic Europe right now.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:39]** And that's what he has.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:42]** And just for the listener, he put on a top hat.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** Yeah, he did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:45]** It goes really well with my monocle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** Because he put the hat on top.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:48]** See?

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** That's a dad joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** That is a dad joke.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:52]** Thank you, Kev.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** That was good.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** I didn't laugh, but thank you.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:54]** I know.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** That was still fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** I'm not supposed to laugh.

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:00]** No one made John laugh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** Do you know what one hat said to the other?

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:02]** What, Will?

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** You go on ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:32]** i like that that's good that made me chuckle so yeah speaking of funny dad moments um i my fingers have have just like gone through this week i dropped a bowl of hot oatmeal and just like shredded two of my fingers oh nice cool and so liliana my daughter was like she had to go get me band-aids that she was super helpful the whole thing

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:36]** The next day, I'm getting bowls out because we had made ice cream.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:38]** And so I'm pulling out a bowl.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** She's like, oh, daddy, hang on.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** I'm going to go get the Band-Aids.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** Don't hurt yourself.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** Just in case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:47]** I'm going to go get the Band-Aids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** Kids are brutal.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:48]** The worst part?

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** Absolutely sincere.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** Like, I just want to be helpful.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** I'm going to go get the Band-Aids.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** Thanks, kid.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** Appreciate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:04]** My wife has a bad habit of bringing in coffee mugs full of coffee in the car.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** Leaving them?

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:09]** Okay, like open-top mugs?

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** Open-top, like a mug.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:16]** Like a will-save mug filled with coffee, and then she'll put it in the cup holder that it doesn't fit in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:23]** By the way, you should go on to our coffee and become a supporter and maybe purchase a mug.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:26]** Yeah, or just buy coffee mugs at shop.whatsapp.com.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:29]** And help us buy, Kev, more coffee.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** No, no more mugs.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:31]** And many more hats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** We need a coffee container.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** What is it?

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:36]** I don't know.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:41]** Anyway, so one time she put it up on the dashboard and then I turned a corner and it fell off.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:45]** Another time she had it on the center console and I didn't know it was there and I elbowed it.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:49]** And several other times she spilled it just on her own when I wasn't in the car.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:52]** It got to the point where our three-year-old son said,

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:55]** Mommy, you should stop bringing coffee in the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:56]** Wow.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:59]** And I was like, yes.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:02]** To which she replied, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:04]** She just went, hmm.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** And she hasn't brought coffee back in the car yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** Okay.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:08]** Well, there you go.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:09]** Winner.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:13]** All it took was the honesty of a child.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** The pragmatism of a toddler, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** The pragmatism of a toddler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:40]** it's just what like having finder and i were talking about having kids the other day and what it's like uh but we didn't we never covered like all they do is it's like your own little like roasters that just like follow you around oh yeah roast you like roast everything you do that part sounds pretty fun yeah the the comparison i've heard that's that i thought was most apt is they're all little drunk people


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:39 - 00:12:08]** and as they get older they just get less and less and less drunk until they don't and then they get a lot more drunk and then you know and then you get drunk with them right yeah Amelia was standing at the front door she can't quite walk yet so she's standing at the front door holding the door wobbling with her water bottle by the straw in the other hand she definitely just looks like

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:13]** She's ready to vomit all over the place in downtown whatever at 2 a.m.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:17]** Because drunk babies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:22]** Do you just get your babies drunk?

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:27]** Cats follow you around and just burn you, just roast you the entire time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:55]** uh if i roast you do you mean just like bite my toes and legs and hands and stuff yeah they'll just like look at you and like push like an item off of a shelf like while looking at you like very like i don't know i want cats that's what i think maybe maybe i think this is a deep this is a deep-seated thing that that you're asking about cats because you really just want to experience the joy vicariously through me of cats roasting you yeah vicariously yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean you should just get some cats


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:58]** This is the will save schism.

**[00:12:59 - 00:12:59]** Truly.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:02]** Children or cats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:04]** And right now it's two and two.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** And Kelly has yet to cast his law.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** Kelly has not cast his law.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** I don't have either of these things.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** I'm going to choose a salamander.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** I'm going to find a salamander here.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** And that's what I'm going to, that's my case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** An axolotl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** Yeah.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:17]** If there is an axolotl for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:24]** Well, Grayson has an axolotl stuffy and he was showing his aunt and she's like, what's that?

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** And he's like, an axolotl.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** And she looked at me and was like, what's he trying to say?

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:32]** And I was like, he's saying axolotl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:38]** If you're aware, an axolotl is a salamander from Mexico.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:44]** To be fair, they're criminally recently like sort of popular, which is kind of sad because they're very cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** They're very endangered.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** That's why they're popular.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** They're also called the Hound of Telemundo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** The Hound of Telemundo.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:53]** The Hound of Telemundo.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** Telemundo.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Joe64.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:58]** All right.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** I think it's time.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** No last from John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** I think it's time to play.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** I didn't quite get my last this time.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** Maybe one day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:31]** i'm sorry john can i can i take these hats off now no no whole episode i mean you gotta fulfill the request what's the request is it the whole episode let's let's let's figure this out let's figure this out wear an unreasonable amount of hats for next recording oh man so i think it's until you're not recording anymore okay and you just put them on backwards you just turn the whole stack around


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:33]** I mean, I would have made it like a propeller.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Yes, fan them out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** You could just spin and take off.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:42]** I fear that that would be unstable.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:45]** No, as long as they stay centered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:46]** Yeah.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** Like a stair step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:54]** That's assuming a consistent build curvature.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:56]** That's assuming consistent mass across the hats.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:59]** There's a lot of assumptions there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Not all hats are the same.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** You should know this.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** Not all hats are the same.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** You're very much against the snapback.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** And I'm only about the snapback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:11]** Is this the beef you're talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:11]** Yeah.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:22]** This was the beef that I didn't want to air for the streets, but now that we're here, I'm a flex, flex, flex fit only type of guy.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:26]** Cause I don't like having a sunburn in the shape.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** This is the other schism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:30]** You should just wear it the correct way.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:35]** And that would prevent you from getting a sunburn on your forehead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:39]** But then you have the hair sticking out the back and you look like a duck, but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** Are you saying I look like a duck butt?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** I look like a duck butt right now.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** You going to say something, Kev?

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:43]** You want to go?

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** No, because you have long hair.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** It's not the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:46]** Yeah.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:53]** Remind me to bring like a UV flashlight the next time we're staying somewhere with Kev so we can just like tan in that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** Yeah, just tan it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:58]** All right.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** You're going to get burned in two seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:00]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:03]** Let's do a little... Have you seen you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:04]** Looking back.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:07]** I get four seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:11]** Let's do a little looking back in the reflection that has kept skin.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** what do y'all recall?

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** I looked back, John.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:16]** Thank you.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** Yeah.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** Thank you for that.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:19]** It did.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:21]** It again, didn't quite make me laugh, but it's fine.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:31]** What do y'all recall from like the first episode, few EPS of book three and landing at T'Challa space.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:40]** I'm trying to just, just start to build in our collective remembrance of events, points of interest, uh,

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:43]** Things that you thought, hmm, that's interesting.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:45]** Or, huh, that was funny.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Or, I didn't like that.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:56]** What are some things from when y'all landed, let's say, at Tercalis Base that you remember that you were like, hmm?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** This stuck with me.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:05]** I remember meeting two new species, which I was there for.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** What were those species?

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** I was getting excited about.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:12]** It was a Vlaka, and then the other one was the... It's the Vlaka, the dog people, right?

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:12]** Yeah.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** And the hyena person.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** And everyone was like, ooh, you don't know what that is.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:19]** But apparently that's a new creature in Starfinder, so whatever.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:24]** Anyway, and then I remember having to give up my armor back before God.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:27]** And then I remember asking for armor and no one would give it to me.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:32]** And I remember being interviewed the first time by freaking what's her name?

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:38]** The doctor so-called like, you know, uh, and then sort of having deja vu because apparently it's happening again.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:38]** That's what I remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:38]** Noel.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** Noel is the name that you're looking for.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:51]** I remember that we aren't getting, are we not in communication with the outside world or we just like get like a, we're not receiving messages or something like that.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** The internet doesn't work, right?

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** The internet doesn't work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:57]** There's a limited amount of access to the infosphere.

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:00]** It's like time delayed or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:04]** Did you ever get a response back from your peeps, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:06]** No, I couldn't even get onto the website.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** It didn't connect.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:10]** It's like the website doesn't exist.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:12]** It's like we got to use it.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** But wait, can you clarify?

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:16]** Did you give the puck to what's-his-face?

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** Shay?

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:17]** Is it Shay?

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** Is that his name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** No, no, no.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:22]** I just asked if Shay could do some research, that's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:27]** So you still have the puck, but nobody knows that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:29]** At least the four of us don't know.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:30]** Except Shay.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:34]** And then Kevin went on to be like, how could you tell Shay and not me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** Yeah, because I'm upset.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** I'm very upset.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** Kevin's upset.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** Rick doesn't know.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** Rick's clueless.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** He's an idiot.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:44]** Will he be upset when... Rick is clueless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** He's an idiot.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** He's an idiot.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:48]** Nah, nah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** I don't know.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** We'll find out.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:54]** Is there something that you specifically wanted us to recall, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:00]** I'm just... I recall I'm being asked...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:18]** nonsensical questions about my origins it's very recent yeah of course or a call not answering anything and then and then john being like oh that means that your memory is developing holes because you have no memories or something like that which better not be true and he looked very happy when he said that what about things before that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Right.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:22]** Like, I remember landing in the hangar.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:30]** I remember there being another ship next to the one that we landed in that seemed like it belonged to the mercenaries that brought us here, maybe.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:35]** I remember some tell of another hangar that had, like, land vehicles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:38]** Yeah, there's another base, supposedly.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** Right, there's a prison somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:41]** Yeah, there's a secret department.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:41 - 00:20:04]** yeah that was like how did we find that out uh bernice wandered down the hallway accidentally i thought maybe i don't know from that but he started to yeah but i don't think y'all have gone much further down the hallway from where the medical center is i think you you talked to orvier right colin


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:09]** I think you were talking to Orvier, and there was something about vehicles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** I don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:13]** And maybe it was some of the Paratons?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:18]** I'm scrolling back in the notes, because I'm the only one logged into it, except for Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** I just watched Kevin take notes.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:20]** Wait, there are notes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** Yeah, there's f***ing notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:28]** Side note, everybody's suspicious.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:29]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** What else do the notes say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** There's a lot of notes.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:33]** Hold on.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** I'm going to go back.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** Gnarla seems clumsy.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:43]** Torv thinks the funeral was nice, but a bit too brief.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:46]** So that's still on the ship, right?

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:49]** And then we get to Tarkala's base.

**[00:20:49 - 00:21:13]** orville wants to rassle that's all i got yeah that's right that's auto correct uh some juval is a vagabond light transport and it's parked next to the void crier uh the same of all is the type of ship yeah you would you would know that that is that's not the ship's name it's it's it's like the model of ship right it's a it's a vagabond light transport

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** Yeah.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** Model.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Thanks, John.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:18]** What else?

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:29]** There were three people in the hangar, an android with working clothes, a human with a flight outfit, and a red-headed woman, a red-headed human, sorry, in steward's outfit.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** There was a restricted area.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** The Vlaka came out.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:37]** Then there was a gnoll, red, an elf, Sylvania.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:40]** And the stewards were guarding a secured area.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:40]** That's right.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:45]** There was kind of a big concern about, like, oh, this is a secured area, but it's a secured area.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** That makes sense.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:48]** Like, only stewards could go back there.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:49]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:52]** Or let Bernice go back, basically.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:58]** It makes sense from it being a military installation that it should be secured, like, from a realism standpoint.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:00]** From a metagaming perspective, I'm like, okay, cool.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** What the fuck are they hiding?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:05]** What new and interesting threats lie behind this iron curtain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** I'm not sure what this line means.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:09]** Rel Nodens.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:12]** Cruella DeVille.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:15]** Steward money hungry mad medical pseudo professional.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** Cruella DeVille.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:21]** Those are Kelly's notes.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** Mad money hungry.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** You asked me to help with the notes.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** I added the Cruella DeVille bit.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:29]** My sum total of contribution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:51]** ah and here it goes so colin colin talks to the pikes peritons in the rec room and they have seen stewards in vehicles uh 10 or 11 days since boarding the chimera oh wait and then error diaspora that was when i tried to get on the computers um yeah my notes are not very good that's what i'm realizing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** they're just blurbs.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** That's all.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:59]** It's like, it's like, that's all, that's all we do too, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:02]** I mean, so then after, after that is when we start splitting up and each going into the rooms.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:08]** And so ultimately, ultimately the, the, um, all of you felt suspicious.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:09]** What was going on?

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:14]** Here's was less suspicious than the other two, but Rick is like, no, they're stewards.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:14]** Yay.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** Famous.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** Uh, famous.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:19]** And now Rick's the ones being investigated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:19]** Yeah.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** What a line of questioning from Dr. Norton.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** So, uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:47]** dude uh in today's notes kevin wrote we simultaneously murder dr nodens that's like the first line that he put i was i'm trying to predict the notes ahead of time trying to manifest yeah yeah yeah that way i don't have to write them during the the episode you know they're already written totally totally yeah so we simultaneously murder dr nodens moving on let me bring y'all back to uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:47 - 00:24:14]** to the map here where we've conveniently been separated into separate rooms in the map in the map i think right as we were leaving last time right as dr nodens was like hey uh thanks so much for your time i'm gonna you you take care i've i've lodged or i've logged some of your concerns and uh we'll be in touch soon i think rick 19 you asked a question yes

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:17]** Sorry, what was that, Rick?

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:22]** I can picture the four scenes of her about to leave, and then it just collapses into the one with Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** What is Terrapin Station?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** Terrapin Station.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:30]** So he takes a sip from her full cup of coffee.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:35]** Terrapin Station is a monitoring station.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:41]** It's a communications station that we have for all communications here on Boros.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** It is a communication station?

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:46]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** Stewards.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:50]** Then why would you transport a patient there?

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** I don't know why you would think that we would do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** Are we finished?

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:58]** May I go?

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** I'm already one step ahead of you.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:03]** And just smiles and gives you a little wink.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** And then walks out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** That doesn't answer the question.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** She doesn't answer questions.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** She just asks them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** Kind of like the GM.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** Dr. Nodens is the GM.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:16]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** What are the four of you doing?

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:23]** You are each in your own individual space here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** We're not locked in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** You were never locked in to begin with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Well, Dr. O.K.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:31]** is going to... If the questioning is over, Dr. O.K.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** is going to go out to the hallway...

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:36]** outside of his interrogation room.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:39]** Is the question over?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:39]** That's great.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** Oh, look who showed up next to here.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:43]** It's the prodigal son.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:47]** It's Silverton.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:48]** What up, Silverton?

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:51]** Did you find out things about my antenna yet or what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:53]** Hey, here's...

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:55]** That was just a few hours ago.

**[00:25:55 - 00:26:00]** It's noon right now, so I'm actually about to just go ahead and... Chop, chop, Silverton.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:10]** That was a little aggressive, but... Well, it's... Excuse me, but I literally just got funneled into this room and then, like, interrogated by, like, your boss, question mark?

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:10]** I don't even know.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:11]** I wasn't here.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** I'm sorry to hear that.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** Yeah, for sure, Silverton.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** It's not like you participated or contributed to that at all.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** All right, cool.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:19]** Well, I'm looking forward to getting my antenna fixed, Silverton.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** Hey, actually... One sec.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:22]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** Okay.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:33]** You hear behind you as you walk out the door and storm out, you think you hear Shay's voice behind you here saying, here's, wait one sec, that puck.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:36]** And then the door kind of shuts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** God dang it.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** Hey, Sylvania, can you move out of the way, please?

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:42]** Because apparently you're in the way of the door and I got to open it.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:45]** Hears opens it and he's like, uh, Shay, is that you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** Hey, how's it going?

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** I can't see you.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:48]** Oh, there you are.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** How are you feeling?

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** Not great, Shay.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** Oh, shit.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** I don't.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** Why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** I can get into it later.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Okay.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** Well, thanks for asking.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** No, now I'm going to answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:03]** So basically, as you can see, my antenna is half clipped, which if that happened to you, that would suck, right?

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** No one's been able to fix it yet.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** You've only been here since yesterday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:14]** And then I got interviewed in a very uncomfortable manner by Nodens.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:15]** Has she ever interviewed you before?

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:18]** Or debriefed you for missions and so on?

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:21]** Yeah, she's definitely debriefed me for missions.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:24]** Does she ask extremely detailed questions going back 20 years?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:30]** He looks over and takes a step back and looks off to his left and...

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:36]** You see that the door for Dr. Nodin's quarters are the door that's up and to your right.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:39]** You can just wink and, like, you know, tell me if you help.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:45]** He just takes a few steps back and he kind of, like, steps up to the door that's at the end of the hallway.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** You're just following him the entire time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:51]** Yeah, and he's like, I mean, look, she's...

**[00:27:51 - 00:28:15]** lowers his voice she's definitely asked some weird questions before but i don't know it's nothing like uncomfortable it's just a little weird she's she's a medical doctor she's a she's a therapist doctor she's she's a psychiatrist you know she does everything so sometimes her reasoning is a little hot i don't know why okay what'd she say no it's all good man what what do you want to talk about well i hate i uh

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** I guess I should do things.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:24]** I might have some more information for you about the armor.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:31]** I'll probably know more later tomorrow at the Pledge Day party.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** And then...

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:37]** The other thing is, wait, you know about Pledge Day, right?

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:38]** No?

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** Inspector Hertz Pledge Day?

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:42]** Okay, your silence would say no.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:42]** It's fine.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** It's cool.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:43]** It's okay.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** Why would you know?

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:49]** So it's Inspector Hertz 10th, sorry, 12th Pledge Day.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:55]** So there's going to be a little celebration and some, you know, kind of like drinks and cake and something.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:55]** I don't know.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:58]** I'm not playing it, but it's a chance to...

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:03]** Just kind of get together and do a little quick celebration and just change things up, change the routine.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** But I might have some more information for you about Harvard then.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:07]** I'm waiting on something.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:10]** Waiting on somebody that means sad to try and get me something for you.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:15]** But that is not the surprise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:18]** Well, that is surprising because everyone's been very unhelpful here.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:21]** But Shay, I'm very happy to hear you've done that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** I'm sorry that everyone's been unhelpful.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** It's horrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** You've been great, Shay.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** No, it's fine.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:25]** Thank you.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:26]** Thank you.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** You're a good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:33]** Look, I found out through a little birdie that here is it's...

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** It's your birthday soon.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:43]** So I wanted to see if there was something, I don't know, got something kind of unique that I wanted to show you.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:46]** I think it might be helpful a little bit.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:54]** Allow us to figure out some more information about the P-U-C-K.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Okay.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** Of course.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:59]** You want to see it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** Yeah, I definitely want to see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Okay, cool, cool.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** Come on, come on.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:13]** Turns around, unlocks the door that is behind him, and then as he opens it up,

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:25]** You're filled with this like sense of wonder and terror kind of at this like pulsing, calming blue space with this massive double height ceiling.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:34]** It's like 25 feet tall and wonder at the scale of this device that you know is a reactor terror.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:42]** At the last time that you saw something like this, there was a giant quantum troll that was attempting to kill you.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** As you walk in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:45]** It's like a little nuclear reactor or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** Yeah, it's clearly a power station for the base.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** It makes sense.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:55]** Shay's a mechanic and, you know, it makes sense that this is his kind of office, let's say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:00]** His office is right next to the reactor, you know, in the radiation area.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** And that's actually where he sleeps.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** How does that make you feel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:04]** Yeah.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:06]** Kev, let's pause the game and talk about that.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Yeah, let's.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** I'm down to here.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:18]** There are some kind of like lonely tools sitting on random shelves and hanging on walls.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** Some have kind of collected dust.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** It doesn't seem like there's too much going on in here.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:27]** You notice that there's also kind of a lonely balcony.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:31]** That can be accessed via a lift or a ladder right inside.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:37]** But mostly taking up the center is this 15-foot-high rectangular reactor power core.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** And Shay steps inside.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** Inside.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Would follow him.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:43]** Can't.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:46]** He steps inside the power core?

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** No, he steps inside the room.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:50]** It is immediately vaporized.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:53]** He sleeps in the power core.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** Here's the surprise!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** That I have a problem with.

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:02]** Meltaman is also... Meltaman's inside, and there is a...

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:08]** There's a large vest with a steward's symbol armor just kind of leaning against the ladder.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:11]** Looks over at you and looks at Shay.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** Shay nods.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:15]** Like, kind of like, too cool to be here?

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** And Shay's like, yeah.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** Let's jump him.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:17]** It's fine.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** It's fine.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:18]** Yeah.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:20]** He walks around to kind of give you some space.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:24]** And Melted Man says, it is good to see you, Hears.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** Good to see you, Melted Man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:28]** That's it.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** Hey, so, uh.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** Again, we're talking about the puck, right?

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** I picked up something that's kind of cool.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:40]** I think you might be interested in how it works.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:41]** Follow me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:53]** Shay steps up the ladder, and if you move your character onto the space that says ladder, you will see things appear in the balcony.

**[00:32:54 - 00:33:02]** Shout out to the levels module on Foundry that allows you to put things at different heights so you can't see them from certain levels.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** That's awesome.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:10]** You see that all along this balcony, along two of the sides, there are a bunch of smaller white boxes.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** They seem to be containers.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** Some are labeled, some are not.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:18]** You have to squeeze a little bit to get past them because they're pretty large.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:24]** So as you start walking around the corner and Shay is trying to lead you along the balcony, Shay...

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** He's like walking and kind of looking, making sure it's about 10 feet up.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:34]** He's making sure that you're following until you get to this green light in the corner.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:42]** There seems to be a device that looks familiar, yet futuristic.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:52]** And there's a green pulsating light in the center, surrounded by these vaporous green waves around it.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:59]** And it's all wired up to a console on the edge of the balcony overlooking the reactor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:10]** Shay says, hey, whatever I put in here, I can replicate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Kind of neat.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** Yeah, that's kind of neat.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:16]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Yeah.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Right?

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** That's insane.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:23]** Here, watch, watch, watch, watch, watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** I had such high hopes for this.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:32]** He takes a stone and there's a couple of pieces of just like random little stones.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:37]** And then he takes it and he puts it close to the green.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:38]** And there's this.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:43]** And then it comes back to his hand.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:46]** And there's another one that just like flings out the other side.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:49]** I've done this now with guns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:55]** I think you need some UPBs in order to get it really working.

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:02]** But I was thinking, if you want, we could do this with your puck.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** You can have as many of these as you want.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:07]** I'm still trying to figure it out.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:09]** It seems like it takes some data.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:17]** So if I knew what it broke down, how it read the information and then replicated it,

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** then maybe we can learn more about it.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:22]** And I'll say you get, you get a second bucket out of it.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** It was cool.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:28]** Uh, but yeah, you know, think on it.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:28]** What do you think?

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:34]** I know that you're as shocked as I am with the silence.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:36]** So you don't have to decide now.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:41]** I just thought that it was something neat that we, that, you know, just wanted to share with you.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:41]** Yeah.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** Kelly.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:45]** This is, you know, I, I appreciate you.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** I've seen some strange things.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** I'm though.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** I'm not surprised.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** Such a thing exists.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:53]** I I'm very, it's very cool to see it in person.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:56]** And I have not seen one in person before.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:59]** I've only heard some stories, but it's, it's really brilliant.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Thank you.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:09]** As Kelly, I really wish that if we, everyone here, including me, is just eternally suspicious of everything.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:16]** But this would be super cool to do in a completely different scenario, is to just throw my puck into this thing and clone it.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:20]** But I don't know what's going to happen if I do that.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:24]** Give me a... John, stop putting me in these situations.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:25]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** Yeah, what's up?

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:30]** Give me... You have a couple options here.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:34]** You can either roll an engineering or mysticism to know more about it.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:37]** You could also roll a perception check if you wanted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:39]** Or a sense f***ing motive!

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:45]** Yeah, I'm going to start with the sense motive and then I'll proceed to go on to some other...

**[00:36:45 - 00:37:12]** not trying to metagame or anything but like yeah no no definitely not him like hearing that you know it's not like a thing yeah for sure okay but you know what here's the thing here's the thing about motive in this here's the specific campaign here's the situation all right so like we've done that before and you're and and you'll just be like we'll be like oh like what's the motive behind this person what do they want i scored a 48 since motive yeah you don't sense anything

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:19]** Or they'll be like, oh, they seem like they want to do this, or they seem like they want... And then they end up not even being... By the way, they're f***ing crazy.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:21]** Sense motive isn't... Exactly.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** Or they just drop dead.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:27]** I don't know what motive, what value it has anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:33]** Sense motive isn't like you're going to get more than an impression, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:39]** I know, but like... That's a street cred... How sheisty is this individual?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:46]** And yeah, but like that, it should give you some indication of what an answer where everything seems fine.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:50]** So like a non-answer like that is also an answer, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:53]** Like when John doesn't answer questions, that's John.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** I don't, I don't honestly, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** Threefold conspiracy was the first game that we played as a group.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:03]** And one of the first basic game, basically that I played is in TTRPG.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:05]** And so I don't have any faith in sense motive.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:21]** where i feel like in other where in other in other aps i probably would but anyway all right i rolled with 19 i i have a headcanon about how here's can get better at it maybe we can talk about it offline or on here if you want but uh yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** I'm down to hear that.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:24]** But yeah, sure.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Why not?

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:32]** I was just saying, since you effectively have a disability in which you, one of your antennas cut, you can't communicate effectively.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:42]** Maybe you feel like you need to invest in some skills that are a little more softer, a little more social, a little more like deception, sense motive, bluff, feats, things like that.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:48]** Because you're like, I'm at, I used to be at one place and now I'm not there anymore and I'm not as good.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** So I'm trying to build that back up.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** It's a thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:53]** It's fine.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:53]** It's fine.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** I understand.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** What do you do?

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:59]** So basically, he's just an uncultured Rube.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:04]** It's not my problem as Jon.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** It's your problem, player.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:09]** If only you had higher charisma stats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** That's also not what I'm saying.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** Roll a sense motive.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** A 19.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** You got a 19.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** Okay.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** He seems genuine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** Except...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** Don't they all?

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:26]** They all seem genuine.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:31]** But there's a better impression of me answering.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:34]** The mic drop with that response.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** Except what?

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:44]** He also knows that this is not like, yeah, it's really cool.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:49]** You know, like as an engineer, you're like, yeah, like this is a really cool process.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** It was awesome.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:58]** He also clearly knows that like, this is not necessarily like the cat's pajamas.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** This is not the bee's knees.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:06]** Like he can read your disappointment and you can see that he understands that.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:11]** So maybe there's, maybe there's something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** Maybe there's something else.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** What do you mean by that?

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** That's what you get from Seth's motive, man.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** He can't give it away.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:22]** Everyone here is like, but there's something happening on the side.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** And we've heard that a lot.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:27]** So everyone's just like, everything's not quite as it seems.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** Which it isn't.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:32]** It hasn't been since day one.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:36]** Here's rolls an engineering check because he's good at that.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:40]** He's an uncultured swine, but he can use engineering.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** So it's 28 for that.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:59]** Yeah, you know for sure that this is a synthesizer that is a quantum synthesizer that is pulling energy from the reactor core as a heat sink.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:14]** And it requires UPBs as fuel in order to break down matter into its most basic components, then copy the matter of what was put into it, and then be able to spit it back out.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:21]** You also know that Shea's smart, for sure.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:29]** Shea rolled pretty well on the old first rolls here, right?

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:39]** But the capability of this machine, because 28's a good roll, this machine does not need to be used in an analog way.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:43]** You can use it telepathically.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** Shea's not doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:46 - 00:42:09]** but you could what do you mean use it like well how would i use it you could operate it in a telepathic way so i put something in and then i can like tell it telepathically to do something to it beyond the normal you can use this machine telepathically right yeah with your yeah yeah yeah but but is that what you mean like though john

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:13]** I don't know what else you can use it telepathically means.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:17]** Well, but, like, why would I have to use it telepathically if it just clones objects?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:18]** You don't have to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:21]** Is the rock already in there?

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:25]** Alright, here's connects to the... Yeah, is the rock already in there?

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:29]** Shay put a rock in and it came back out.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:32]** Is the original rock still in there?

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** No, it came back out.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:34]** Okay.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:38]** So here's, I guess, just talks to it telepathically.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:41]** He's just like, and I had to flip a coin.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** Hey, machine.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** Speak to me.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** Speak to me, your secrets machine.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:49]** I want to know what you're all about.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:53]** He feels kind of stupid because he doesn't know if the machine's actually going to respond.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** But that's what he's going to do.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** Roll a D120.

**[00:42:57 - 00:43:00]** And then, yeah, it's quiet.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:02]** So he just says that to it and it alone.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** What is it that you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:08]** The machine doesn't talk to you, but

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:18]** It acknowledges your presence and is willing to take in whatever you want to put in.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:21]** And then reproduce it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:24]** Just put your intent in there, bro.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** Can I give it thoughts?

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** Can I duplicate thoughts?

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:27]** Is that a thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** No, no, no.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:32]** It's going to synthesize things like a culinary synthesizer would.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** But the thing is...

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:38]** Yes, you might have heard about something like this.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** You have not seen anything like this before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:48]** When you say synthesize it, that means that it takes the data and it stores it as well, correct?

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** Does it also do that?

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** You think that part of it stores it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:53 - 00:44:22]** here's you good man you uh you just been kind of staring am i right like this thing uh yeah no i just do that sometimes sometimes i just stare off into the distance yeah for sure yeah so like i don't know why you think that you're not that i mean like you clearly get excited like you like haven't seen a lot of other you know species but that's that's fine oh my god all right let's let's change the topic all right look here's the thing yeah what's up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:47]** uh apparently this thing like uh stores the data correct so what is it that you want me to do you want me to like put this in here duplicate it you keep the duplicate and then research it correct with all of your yeah sure and so on and then you come back to me with answers correct yeah sure and i thought maybe like i could just try and like you know like learn from what's in here right i could share that with you that might be cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** Could do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** Yeah, I could do that.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:55]** Um, but the problem is, is that like, this is a, you know, a dear friend of mine gave this to me.

**[00:44:55 - 00:45:02]** And if I put it in here, uh, then they could, yeah, I, I just don't want just lies.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** No, he doesn't lie.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:03]** All right.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** I don't want to have to make another role.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** Like, uh, he's just like, uh, yeah.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:10]** So I just don't want like any of his information to be compromised.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:10]** Same.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** Do you have any other resources available at your disposal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:16]** I mean, you already given it to me and melt.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** The man has, uh, you know,

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:42]** scanned it I just thought we had another way to scan it so hey if you uh if you don't want to that's fine you can also think about it come back to me later I just thought it was cool so yeah not gonna it would be cool not like would like to see it gonna be truthful here would like to see what happens and learn more not gonna force you uh anyway look here's yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:43 - 00:46:05]** what's up you know here is is going to do what he wants to put in the uh the the uh the what's it called the figurine of wondrous power oh wait hold on actually no i don't want to risk it though i i don't i can't i don't trust you john i i feel like if i put something in here something's going to happen will it be destroyed is there a way that i can know for sure that electrovore is going to be okay if i put it in this machine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** He put in a rock and it came out the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:11]** He said that he's done it with other more important items, like weapons and other things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** Now there's the Electrovor.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** It's a summon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:18]** I know, but like, I understand, but it has magical properties and I don't want it to be corrupted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:24]** Hey, if you want to put something else in here, like besides a puck, it's cool, but...

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:29]** Either we should do it now because the thing is that, like, you're really not supposed to be in here.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:34]** So I brought you in because it's cool and because I like you and everything and, you know, the birthday stuff.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:38]** But, like, maybe we can do this later if you're not sure right now.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:38]** That's fine.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** That's cool.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** I'll do it later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:42 - 00:47:04]** put out or get out is what he's saying here let me uh squeeze by you just give me and he squeezes by you awkwardly and then it's not like a whore he's not just gonna put out like immediately you're just an uncultured room go back down on ladder yeah and then yep

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:10]** Just invest in some soft skills, Hears, and then one day... Wrong way there, Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:11]** All right.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Thanks, Shay.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:16]** I really do appreciate you showing me, and I'll think about it.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** Have a nice day.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** All right.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:19]** Cool.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:19]** You too.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:20]** See you.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** Bye, Shay.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:21]** Love you.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** Bye.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:23]** What?

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:25]** Oh, okay.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:28]** Nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:57]** the door's closed i can't get out there's a shay looking at me go colin thing sexy i didn't need to make that sexy i don't know how that got me sexy but i got to be sexy wait what to mention that that's fine nico and colin uh yeah yeah we're just shipping everyone here yeah i'm shipping shame they're gonna all right so here's it's not ready to be shipped so what is everyone doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:01]** Rick's still stuck in that interrogation room.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:01]** You are not stuck.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** You can leave whenever you want, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** Oh, I can just walk out?

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** That doesn't seem right.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** You were never locked in there to begin with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:12]** Rick picks up Bernice and is going to walk out of the room.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** My token collided with something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:17]** Okay, so Rick's walking out.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:21]** Is this Dr. Nodens in the next room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** No, that's... That's Silverton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:26]** Yeah, it's me, not Dr. Nodens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Rick stabs Silverton in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** Whoa!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:41]** Kevin, you played your character so well today, but it's kind of alarming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:47]** So Rick is carrying Bernice, and he just kind of nods at Silverton, and then he's going to go down to the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** All right, Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** My token collided again.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** Okay.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:58]** And he's going to take a long look down that hallway.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:03]** With, I believe it's an 18, maybe.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:03]** Let me double check.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** What's my perception at?

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:07]** Perception.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** Yeah, 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:21]** You can hear the sounds of some sort of like laugh and happiness coming from down around the corner.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:24]** You know, you're probably, what, 25 feet away from the hall.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** There's a door right at the end of the hall.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** There's a door to your right.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** And then the hallway turns to the left.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:33]** From down that hallway, you think that you hear laughter for a second as if a door is opening.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:38]** And then it, you know, fades away.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:43]** You see the door dead ahead of you is the door into the reactor.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:48]** And then... Where Hears is currently?

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:50]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:55]** Well, you wouldn't know where Hears is, but... No, but it's the same reactor that we were talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:06]** And then there does seem to be a door to the right before you get there that is the doctor's course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:09]** Rick is going to pick up Bernice...

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:40]** up to his chest and whisper into the microphone of Bernice and say I am going further in to investigate I'm not sure what I'll find and he's going to put Bernice down to his side and walk down that hallway okay you start walking down the hallway who do I see at the end of the hallway you what does Bernice do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:49]** Bernice is going to sit back, I think, maybe, and try to run interference if somebody comes up behind him.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** Okay.

**[00:50:52 - 00:51:04]** That's what Dr. Okay probably would have gotten, like a notification from Bernice, I'm assuming, and would kind of maybe telepathically tell here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:11]** Looks like Rick's about to get us in trouble, it seems, if we're not already in it.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:15]** Maybe we should stick around here in case he needs us.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:19]** I'm right next to you, Sylvain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** We're in the same room.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** We're in the same room.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:26]** No, but telepathically is the right way to do it, though.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:27]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:34]** So, he just, like, flitters his eyes, like, at you, and then smiles, and he's like, I'll, uh...

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** Yeah, we're close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:39]** Do you say that telepathically?

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:43]** Because if you do, you should roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:46]** Just make it big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:50]** Heads is it's like, you know.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:50]** All right, cool.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** We're good.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:53]** We're still good.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Just the doctor.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:57]** Rick, you are walking down.

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:00]** You pass Dr. Noden's door.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** You don't hear anything.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:08]** You get up to the door where the reactor room is.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:13]** It's clearly some sort of engineering room.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:13]** You don't hear anything.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:17]** You look down the hall to your left.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:27]** You see two more doors, two sets of double doors about 30 feet down the hallway.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:30]** I'm going to ping where they are so you can see on the map.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** One on either side of the hallway.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:40]** At the very end of the hallway, you see the back of Shay, Daisha, talking with somebody.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:48]** You can just barely hear like... And they don't appear to see you yet.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:52]** Get in trouble?

**[00:52:53 - 00:53:00]** Um... Rick is going to roll stealth to walk up.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** Roll stealth to walk up.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:03]** Okay.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** That's a 14.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:10]** That is a 14, he says.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:16]** And so Rick is going to walk up that hallway to where the first set of doors are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** Yeah, so they're directly across from each other.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** You start walking up.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:22]** There's one on your left, one on your right.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:27]** The one on the left seems like it gets a lot of use.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** There's like vision glass in it.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** So you can see a little bit through.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** You see some storage.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:36]** You think based on where you are, this is probably a warehouse.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:43]** And you recall when you first got off of the ship.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:51]** That Inspector Heard and the Vlaka, Officer Estara, came through a double door on the other side.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** You think, this is probably a warehouse.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:59]** Like, if I were to look all the way through, I could probably see the doors that go into the hangar.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:07]** The door to the right looks like it's some sort of garage.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** Is there a window on that door?

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:12]** There's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:17]** Is there any markings on that door?

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:20]** Yeah, marking for garage.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:21]** Is this garage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:24]** Yeah.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:28]** And for the moment, they don't seem to notice you.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:33]** But their voices are getting louder as you're walking towards it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** Towards them, talking.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:40]** My heart is racing, and I'm sure Rick's is too.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:43]** Um...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:47 - 00:55:00]** Bernice, while this is going on, when he sees Rick go up the hallway, is going to move towards... Is the hallway really well-kept?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:02]** It's cleaned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:05]** There's no, like, loose panels or anything like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** Not necessarily, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:09]** Okay.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:09]** Yeah.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:15]** There's not a panel that says the Chimera or what was the other ship from... Star Dream 2?

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** Yes, I think, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:27]** I think Bernice is just going to go just to the corner and peek, like, stealthily try to hide in plain sight, kind of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** Hmm.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** So where do you move?

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:32]** So move, Vernice, to where you want to go.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:38]** Okay, so just right beyond, just on the other side of the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:41]** Yeah, just enough to hear what's going on, kind of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:42]** Okay.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** Maybe peek around.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:53]** Yeah, I mean, Rick, you're standing in an open hallway that's five feet wide and realizing that Shay and whoever Shay's talking to are engrossed in a conversation.

**[00:55:53 - 00:56:01]** And the reason that you haven't been seen yet in your mind is like whoever they're talking to can't see behind Shay.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:04]** And Shay's just looking at them.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:07]** So at any moment, Shay could turn.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:12]** They could just move a little bit, shuffle as you do in conversation, and see you.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Better duck in, man.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:18]** And Bernice is right at the edge of the hole.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** Right there.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:23]** Knowing that if you go a little further, you might get seen too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:33]** Yeah, I was real torn about going into that garage or moving into the room with Shay.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:42]** And I flip the die and I'm going to move up to Shay.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:45]** I'm going to roll another stealth check, but this is not, I just want to be very clear.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:48]** It's not like an aggressive stealth.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:49]** It's not like I'm hiding.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:55]** It's just, I'm not, I'm trying not to be loud because it's almost as if I don't want to interrupt their conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:56]** It's how Rick is playing.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:02]** That's a really low roll.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:03]** What is my stealth at?

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:09]** It's a five on the die for a 14 total.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:12]** 14.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:25]** And so Rick is going to move up right behind and kind of, well, I'm going to move up right behind Shea, but then I'm trying to see, it looks like there's some more room.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:27]** So he's going to step out to the side of Shea.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** Step out to the side of Shea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:38]** So you walk up and reveal yourself to them, stepping literally right next to them.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:47]** As you step in, you see that there's a hallway off to your left, another, you know, thin little connecting hallway that goes around the corner and curves.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:53]** There's a door directly in front of you to the north, a single door.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** This is training.

**[00:57:57 - 00:58:04]** The hallway then peels off past that door to the right and directly to your right.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:12]** As soon as the hallway opens up, you see that there is a room that clearly looks like some sort of command center room.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:16]** And there's a door and there's two big panes of glass.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** On either side of the door.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** And on one side you can see monitors.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** This is to the right of where you are now.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:29]** On one side you can see monitors where there are computer monitors and somebody's sitting there.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:32]** Can I see what's on the monitors?

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** Their backs are to you.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:42]** Like you can't see what's on the monitors because they are facing the person and the person is on the other side of them.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** So you can just see the back of the monitors.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** You can't see anything.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:47]** Oh, I thought you meant they're facing the door or the windows.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:49]** Yeah, they are facing the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:53]** And I can't see the reflection in their eyes of what's on there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:57]** And it is at that time.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:01]** Bernie's watching.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:06]** Watches Rick go up and around the corner.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:13]** And Bernice hears the door open behind her.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** I wasn't trying to get Bernice caught!

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** Stranger danger.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:25]** There it is.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** There's so many.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:27]** I'm sorry.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** You can rebuild, right?

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:32]** You can rebuild, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** I mean, Bernie's just going to play dumb.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** She's a drone.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:37]** She's just going to be like, what?

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** Where am I?

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:40]** She's just going to go into a suitcase.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:41]** Yeah.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:44]** We're in a suitcase again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:46]** What are you talking about?

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:48]** All of her feet suck up.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** Good game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:51]** All of the intrigue.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** We're back.
