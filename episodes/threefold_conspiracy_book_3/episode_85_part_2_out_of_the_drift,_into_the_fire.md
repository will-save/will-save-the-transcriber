## Speaker_0

**[00:00:02 - 00:00:29]** so so


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:23]** You have come to the right place at the right time.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:26]** Welcome to Will Say The Podcast.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** Let's play.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:32]** I wish everyone a good night's rest, and we'll see you in the morning for breakfast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:34]** Okay.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** Five days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:38]** What does everyone do right now?

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:40]** Let's say it's like 4 or 5 a.m.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:47]** Starting to be the early morning, most of the crew, the peritons, are starting to head off into their rooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** Colin, having checked everyone, is like, fuck this.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:54]** It's been a long day.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** He's taking his notes.

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:01]** He's put some work in on the gray flying saucer.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** Like, he's ready to go to sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** Okay.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** Yeah, he's going to take a long rest for sure.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** I like it.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** Don't want another bad dream, John.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** I just want a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:13]** Just want a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** With normal time lapse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** The normal amount of time that lasts.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:17]** Just a normal night.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** That's all I ask.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:21]** Just a super normal night.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:23]** Nothing else goes crazy.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** Yeah, that's what I want.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Okay.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Let's see how that ends.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:26]** Let's do that.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:27]** Okay.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** And Rick19?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** Is the doctor okay?

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Well, I don't think he's ready to rest.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** I think Rick would actually go back up to the bridge.

**[00:02:37 - 00:03:02]** almost he's he's just he's trying to observe he wants he's offset by what happened and he's almost like standing guard on the ship like nobody else is paying attention to security of this thing and he just he's watching all the screens and kind of like observing all the people so narla and kaniko are up there and shea heads back up there too so yeah and i don't trust any of them they're f***ing great for all i know okay yeah i mean you can't trust anyone


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:07]** You can't trust good Pyke's Peritons anymore.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** We can barely trust ourselves, to be honest.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** So what can you do?

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:25]** But what can you do other than take a moment of rest, some respite from slaying greys and checking cavities on...

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** What sort of cavities?

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:30]** Naked crewmen who are not wearing armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** Aye, Doctor, okay.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:35]** I didn't know you did an orthodontic practicum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** Not that kind of cavity.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:40]** I don't think he meant those kinds of cavities.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:43]** May I remind you, doctor, you are not a medical doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:47]** I was making sure there wasn't any gray probes, you know?

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** You hear stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:49]** Okay.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** Is this your excuse?

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** You're just like, I'm a doctor, trust me.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:54]** Don't say in what.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:57]** Open your cavities, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** But I am a doctor.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:58]** All right.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** So.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:02]** It sounds like Rick is staying up, Colin, Dr.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:04]** O.K., or, well, I didn't hear what you said, Dr.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** O.K., but are you going to go to sleep, too?

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** You're going to crash?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** I mean, I might as well.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:10]** I'm not really injured or anything.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:15]** I don't need to go to bed, but, I mean, I could get back one of my biohacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:15]** Okay.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:19]** Rick needs to sleep, but I don't think he would.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** Who am I rooming with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Oh, shit, I'm rooming with Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:28]** Rick, you're operating on a shoestring budget as far as I'm concerned.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:34]** You've taken a big... I mean, you didn't even step in for a medical exam, and I can just see that you're tired.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:45]** I think if you'd like, I don't mind to stay up through the night and observe if you want to take a rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** Rick, let's go to bed.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:48]** Like, we're in the same room, right?

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** Let's just sleep.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** We need it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** All right.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:56]** So let me... From the bridge...

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:00]** Rick is gonna stop by the bridge and then yeah, I'll head to the rack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:07]** And I'll hang out on the bridge with Gnarla and just, I'll mosey around.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** I gotta get some exercise.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:15]** It's been a while since I've been sitting in that pilot chair and cramped in that engineering space throughout combat.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** It's good to stretch my legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** Do you even have legs?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:22]** I stretch my tentacles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:26]** Yeah, what's under your robes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:32]** Listen, we're not here to instigate my biology, but if you want, I'm happy to share.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:39]** Speaking of biology, I could actually use some medical attention.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** I'm quite hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:45]** I don't mind to give you a... I can do a field dressing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:49]** My stamina is actually full, but my hit points are down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:57]** Yeah, I can give you a... I'm going to give you a field dressing then as a standard action.

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:03]** And, yeah, I just need to roll 1d6 plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** 1d6 plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Plus four.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** You get eight hit points back.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Ooh.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:09]** Yikes.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:09]** Thank you.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:09]** Tasty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** That's pretty good.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:11]** Very nice.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** Oh, my God.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:13]** You said eight?

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:14]** Eight.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** I think he is a medical doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** I mean, I dabble.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** I'm into holistic medicine.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** He's just an ombudslug.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** He's a medical hobbyist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:26]** Yeah.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** I like it.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:34]** So, Rick, you stopped by the bridge and then you went down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:38]** Yeah, can I roll perception and sense motive on the bridge?

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:39]** Sure.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** If there's anything to roll.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:41]** Sure.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:45]** Uh, 18 perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:49]** Yeah, they, it seems like they're just talking.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:56]** Kaniko is filling in Gnarla and Shay on kind of what happened, any details that you all might not have given them already.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:59]** And there's nothing on the monitors?

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:01]** No, I mean, they're all monitoring and doing that.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:06]** So you're looking over their shoulder, kind of, they check and you go and check and you don't see anything.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** You seem like you are back on course to Varus.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:09]** Right.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:10]** Yeah.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** And so you head to bed.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** Dr. O'Kay, you're walking around.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:18]** At some point, you might see Kaniko heading to bed.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:23]** And then the next time you head up to the bridge, you see that Orvir has gone up and relieved Kaniko.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** So Kaniko can actually get some sleep as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:30]** Uh, here's his waiting for Rick cause he wants to make sure he's okay.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** So she's waiting for the lower deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:32]** All right.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:35]** Um, I'll find out how to, it's the lower deck.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** Isn't that where we stay?

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** It's the lower deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:37]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** I don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:41]** You're staying on the lower deck.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:42]** Yeah.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** And pardon me for the floating tokens that are just moving through.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:50]** It's a lot to have every token take the elevator.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** When you're every character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:55]** He sees Rick come out of the elevator.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:58]** He puts out a cigarette and he's like, alright, you good?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** You were waiting for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** I'm just making sure you're alright.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** I know you did a good job.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** I probably took a lot out of you though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:06]** Thank you.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** How are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** I'm sound, man.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** I'm all right.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:15]** I'm kind of sad we're going to have to give up our armor, apparently, but beyond that, I'm okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** I think I convinced Orvir to let me keep it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:22]** Well, I still have some work to do tomorrow, so maybe I'll ask for your advice.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** No, I'm just kidding.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:17]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:20]** He just takes them in his hand and they kind of absorb into his hand.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:22]** Yeah, that's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:34]** I'm just crushing it up in my palm with a mortar and pestle and snorting it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:38]** So the next morning comes.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:43]** The only thing I'll ask is, you know, I think we're going to start to move through our five days here.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:46]** A little bit of an accelerated pace.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:46]** Hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** You said the next morning comes.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:50]** Does that mean we get a long rest?

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** You all get a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:57]** And I ask Piers, do you meet Orgat for breakfast or no?

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** Yeah, after I get a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** Or do you ghost him?

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:03]** Okay, so after the first day, I'm going to take a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:05]** I guess I'll go to breakfast.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** Can I get a full rest?

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:10]** Okay, yeah, you still get a long rest, but maybe you were a little late.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** She's finishing up, but she catches you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** No, no finishing up.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** We need to have a proper breakfast.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** What is this?

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Okay.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:19]** Well, yeah, but she gets up a little early.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:23]** I guess if you have, like, a giant mouth, you can just, like, absorb all your food in, like, an instant.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** But, like, he doesn't like that.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** He needs to, like, actually, like... Yeah.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:26]** So, all right.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** I'm going to, like, breakfast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:33]** So, do I, like, over the course of five days get a long rest?

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:33]** Can I do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** Or, like, is that fair?

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** No, we're going to move back to a long...

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:42]** to a normal schedule for the most part, you know, like you all are, we just haven't gotten there.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:45]** I was asking, are you just going to stay up for this first day?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** Yeah, just the first day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** So you stay up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:51]** I mean, we could probably take shifts if we had to, but... Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** So let's go back to...

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** Breakfast.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:59]** Orgat, you and Hirs, you and Orgat start talking.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:03]** They are down in the room.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:03]** Give me one sec.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** So they're at breakfast with you.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:07]** Yeah, we're in the cafe together.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:09]** Yeah, so you all start talking.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:12]** What kind of questions do you ask?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** Hey, how's it going?

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** Oh, man.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** I am just... Oh, my neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** Oh, I'm sore.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:20]** Starts to drink some more coffee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:21]** Sorry to hear that.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** Drinks the same way that you do.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:25]** He just goes... It's a match made in heaven.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:29]** He just goes behind Orgot and, like, gives her a bit of a shoulder massage.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** Like, it's all right.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** You've been through a lot.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** Oh, thank you.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** Yeah, it's okay.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Just take that in right there.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** You're all right.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Yeah.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:38]** Okay.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** So, what have we got for breakfast?


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:40]** Uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:43]** What is this Aoxian fare that you have set up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:45]** Well, I did synthesize a little of the tongue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** If you spread it, it's a little bit of a pate.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:50]** If you spread it on this toast here, it makes one for you.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:51]** Okay.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:52]** It's quite good.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:58]** There is some sauce that I would, that hors d'oeuvres likes to use, but just straight, I think is better.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** Much, much, much better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** All right, here goes nothing.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** John, how does it taste?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:06]** Tastes, honestly, really gross to you.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** Oh, okay.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:14]** Yeah, it tastes like rotting and kind of like the shark delicacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** He's like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** It smells like dirty.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:22]** Oh, that was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** That's a really good deep cut.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:27]** Did you like it?

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:30]** I feel really... Yeah, I think I'm full now.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** Oh, well, yeah.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** You must have a small stomach for sharing.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** Yeah, well.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** Now...

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** What's going on?

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:46]** What's your next assignment after we get to the steward's base?

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:49]** Are you done off to your next assignment or are you going to stick around with them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** Quick question.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:53]** That's an Orvier and Koneko question.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** I am not sure.

**[00:12:55 - 00:13:03]** I would honestly like a bit of downtime to research some more of the texts that I am studying.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** The texts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:10]** Well, you know, I'm very fascinated and I'm a very devoted devotee of Phrasma.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:13]** That's actually why I grew up on Eox.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:19]** You might know about the Spiral Basilica, but my parents actually were there, and so I was...

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:26]** Grew up there, so that's why I have this affinity for some of this very unusual.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** I know that you didn't like the tongue.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:28]** It's okay.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:32]** Oh, well, in my culture, we try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** I appreciate you trying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** Yeah, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** That's why I, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:39]** Oh, yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:46]** I'm just studying some of the deeper texts, trying to find some meaning and make some connections.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** And she goes into some deep lore.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** Not too much.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:51]** She knows how to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:51 - 00:14:21]** say enough to grab you but not bore you if you don't want to get too deep into it that's good i mean for asthma otherwise known as the lady of graves uh yes great goddess of birth death oh man is this a star finder story time is it a star finder story time it probably is not star finder story time is that a is that a star finder story time from our just a brief one kelly yeah okay yeah do we do we have a drop or do we play the job or just record it in


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:24]** We do have the drop, but I don't know where that went.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** Yeah, we can put it in post.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** We'll just put it in post.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** Yeah, why don't we just put it in post?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:31]** You want to put it in post?

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:31]** Let's just put it in post.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:34]** Starfinder Storytime!

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** Starfinder Storytime!

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:36]** Starfinder Storytime!

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:38]** Starfinder Storytime!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:49]** Uh, as the, so, Phrasma is otherwise known as the Lady of Graves, and as the goddess of birth, death, and fate, Phrasma awaits all mortals when they die.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:57]** Her realm, the Boneyard, sits atop an impossibly tall spire overlooking the city plane of Axis, which is, I guess, what you were referring to earlier, right, Jon?

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:01]** No, the Spiral Basilica is a separate entity on the Ox.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Apparently a lot of spires.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:11]** And is the final destination of the River of Souls the metaphysical stream that carries the souls of dead mortals to a realm for judgment and subsequent assignment to an afterlife in the Outer Planes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:15]** The final destination of the River of Souls does sound like Hades, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:19]** Yeah, it's kind of cool.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:21]** There's more, but basically...

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:22]** Yeah.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:30]** So, Phorasmus sternly observes both life and death, assigning afterlives in accordance with mortals' characters, but without a personal interest in either sin or righteousness.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** I see.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:32]** Okay.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:32]** That's cool.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:38]** I guess because you grew up on Aoxia, is that where your interest in her started?

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** as a deity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:42]** Yeah, well, I mean, it's my parents, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:42 - 00:16:07]** They were the ones that actually got me to be a believer, and I went through that time when you rebel, but honestly, there was... I had a major event when some of the, you know, the rogue undead hordes that attack, I joined one of the hotheads who went out to fight them, and I don't think I've ever felt anything like that before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:18]** So, I've been ready for battle ever since, and I knew that staying at Yacht would not satiate that, so that's why I joined up with the Americans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** I can empathize with that.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** Right?

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:22]** I mean, I've also been to a bit of a space fair, and...

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:27]** uh, you know, I'll just kind of leave it there, but I kind of get it like space fair combat and so on.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:36]** Here's, here's wants to get the sense if there's any useful sort of information generally towards their mission that he can figure out from her before wrapping up this conversation.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** Sure.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Sort of check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** I mean, uh,

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:42]** I think you could do maybe a diplomacy.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** What check do you think?

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:47]** Like just talking through it, it seems like she's just trying to get to know you better.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** That's it.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:51]** Just being friendly, chatting with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** Getting to know you.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:56]** Getting to know you, getting to know all about you.

**[00:16:56 - 00:17:00]** Here's a, it's fine with that, but he does want to like see if, um,

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** I don't know.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:12]** Just a general, like, is there anything I can, like, get from her that maybe will help us, like, answer some questions that we have with the greys and so on and how they got corrupted and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** She doesn't know too much.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:18]** She does apologize to you again and saying she doesn't know if she hurt you.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:23]** But I guess through the hypnosis, she might remember attacking the four of you and being in that hallway.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:27]** And so she apologizes again.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:35]** There's no more information that she has other than that she was told that you were a traitor and you were dangerous and you needed to be taken out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:39]** Well, Orgot, I really appreciated this conversation.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:41]** You're a really cool gal.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** So let me give you my contact information.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:48]** You can reach out anytime and we can do this again, you know, in a friendly way, like sometime again.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** Very platonic.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:52]** You're just like really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:53]** Thanks, you are too.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** Hey, do you have my artwork?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:03]** Here's as he said that was like off the chair, like, you know, kind of like moving towards the exit, like ready to leave.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:06]** Those were his parting words and he just freezes.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:09]** And he's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:29]** yeah i got it right here actually and he like slowly unboxed it in the kitchen he wrote his number on the on the side of the armor and then took it off the editor and he gives her the cassava microport no i'm just kidding he gives her the armor back


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:49]** oh man i really wanted to see where that was going thank you you know i i'll call you later i appreciate it thanks for keeping it safe for me we'll uh we'll do some grenadine shots later i would have been like all right i wanted to get it fixed first so

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** Nice roleplay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** Kelly, that was fun.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** That was good.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:53]** Thanks.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** That was a nice little sweet moment.

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:00]** Here's this kind of... I, Kelly, and here's are both a little bit kind of annoyed.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** But it is what it is.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:04]** So here's... Well, I don't want to give up the armor.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:08]** I already have a low enough, you know... Okay.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:11]** It was... Goodbye, freebooter armor number one.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** Lee's foundry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** All right.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:16]** So I think...

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:33]** I'm going to ask you all, I think after that nice little breakfast meeting, if there was anything specific that you all wanted to do with some NPCs or during this next five days, the days pass pretty quickly.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:41]** Uneventfully start thinking about if there's anything that you wanted to say or do, you know, during that time, how are you spending your time?

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** You talking to anybody?

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:48]** I'll tell you that later on, on that second day, there is a.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:51]** All call from Narla.

**[00:19:53 - 00:20:00]** And she asks that everyone join her in the brig for the funeral.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:04]** Who all is attending?

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** Who died?

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** Who died?

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** Here's...

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** Yeah.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:12]** You'll recall that there were two of the Plex Peritons who passed away during outpost Omicron.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** And they talked about this at the beginning.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:19]** They were going to have that first night was a dinner and they were going to have a little ceremony that got interrupted.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** Or God.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** Sorry.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** I forgot about that.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:23]** I don't mind.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** That's okay.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** Here's, here's, it'll be there as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** Yeah.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** Everyone is there.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** Um, I can pull in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:32]** Hey, or God, do you want to give a bit of a prayer?

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** I mean, you know, for asthma and that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:54]** yeah oh yeah i've i've yeah i definitely will you said the brig i appreciate that yeah it's in the brig that's like the best storage space that they have wait how do they get into the brig where's the funeral again the bridge it's in the brig that's a bad place for a funeral why would it be there because it's also it doubles as a storage space

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** Welcome to ship life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:58]** Either of those places are not a place to have a funeral.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** It's so strange to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:01]** Just on a submarine, there is no brig.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:04]** If somebody gets in enough trouble that they get locked up, they get thrown into a storage closet.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** Let us honor you in our little prisons.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** I expected you to finish that sentence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:10]** Don't we want to move them to the airlock?

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** They get thrown into the ocean.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:15]** Star Trek status, where eventually you just kind of send them into space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:19]** They just get yeeted off into the ether.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:20]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** You, Dr.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:25]** O.K., remember that they are not going to be yeeted off into the ether.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:29]** They are being brought back to Pactuals.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:29]** Gotcha.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:37]** That was, upon re-inspection of that thought, you're like, yeah, no, they're going to stay forever.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:41]** So Colin makes his way to the main deck from the lower deck.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:43]** I mean, that would never happen in the Navy, would it?

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:47]** Having finally had a decent night's rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** They don't bury you at sea?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** Just shoot them into the ocean.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:52]** Very rarely, not that I know of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:58]** It's been a very special occasion if you get shot into the ocean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:59 - 00:21:59]** Okay.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:02]** Okay, so you all joined.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** So everyone's running, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:03]** Yeah.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Okay, cool.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:08]** I want them to wake up and start screaming.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:09]** Dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:16]** The camera swings around as you all join in.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:19]** Rick, you can come in on Foundry.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Find some space.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:43]** camera swings around and you see the entire crew there including you all everyone's weary uh body's sore but slowly recovering and this you can tell that everyone's a little somber because they forgot for a sec with everything about this so their hearts are empty for some who knows when they'll be refilled

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:48]** Before you all, you do see two silver, sleek, unblemished boxes.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:50]** These are the bodies... Rick's standing on it?

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** Yep.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:54]** You're standing right... It's like video game style.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** You're standing on top of it.

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:04]** These are the bodies of Melody and Sorin, who have been mentioned before they perished aboard at Post-Omicron.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:10]** Norla, Norla, Norla Orvier and Shay is piloting.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:12]** Is that their couple name?

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:12]** Norla.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:14]** Norla, yeah.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:17]** Norla and Orvier are standing at the front.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** Orgat is off to the side.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** They are looking at everyone.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:23]** Norla kind of slowly says...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:29]** Thank you all for joining this recognition of our lost crew.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:31]** I'll just start with a few words.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:35]** Stewards are called to sacrifice many things.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:48]** In our line of work, it may be family or friends, a wedding, a birthday, the important milestones in life, or maybe just the piece of a good drink over at the Good Omen.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** She smiles.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** A few people smile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:57]** Many times, though, we are called to the highest sacrifice for death.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:01]** It is a door that we will all race and reach to in our lives.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:12]** And while we know that their souls continue on through that door, it is a door nonetheless and remains nearly closed to those who remain.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:17]** Fetch and Hesper are kind of leaning over each other.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:22]** At this point, Fetch's shoulders kind of shake a little bit.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** You hear some sniffling.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** Orgat says,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** Varesma waits for us all.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:36]** She has seen us into the world and she welcomes us as we leave.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:47]** We never know when we will reach her door in our lives or when those closest to us may walk through and never cease walking with us.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:51]** May their memory forever be a gift.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** She looks at Orvier.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** Orvier says,

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** I'll be brief.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:04]** Melody was fierce, strong, tougher than me.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:13]** She was those who become, and she touched new worlds and inspired many with her strength.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:19]** And Soren could always make you laugh when you least expected it.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:25]** He was the brother we all wanted, and not with us as long as we would have hoped.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** Torv.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:28]** So now.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:31]** Sniffling.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** Wiping his face.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** The eye has turned.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:36]** Actually, it's still red.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:47]** Orvir nods at Narla, who begins speaking, and the other Paratons actually join in, and you hear Shae's voice over the intercom.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:50]** From strength, unity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** From unity, strength.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:55]** Thus do we stand against chaos.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:59]** Thus do we honor their sacrifice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** You all would know this is the steward motto.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:12]** We say our goodbyes here, and although Melody and Soren were not stewards, we treat them as such in our service.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:24]** So here as a family, we bid them farewell, and then upon our return to Veros, they will be sent to their final destination of choice.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:32]** Now this might be unfamiliar to some of you, but along the way, their bodies will pass by many.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:45]** It is a custom to give those viewers, those friends, and even those family who they've returned to, a sense of who these fine individuals were out here.

**[00:26:46 - 00:27:09]** in a way that they could not have known so i encourage you all now you may add photos or videos or texts or memories that will they will play on the coffin along the way and two rolls of silver shiny staticky shimmering tape are handed out um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:17]** Orgat pulls some out and Kaniko pulls some out and Colin and Dr. OK, you have a chance to.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:25]** This is like a tradition where you can upload a video or a photo or write some text and they put it on the coffin.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:37]** And then everyone, their families get a sense of who they knew, of what they were like, what they went through, as do other people who see stewards and people affiliated with stewards.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:42]** If they see this procession coming, they can see who these people were.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:44]** They hand the two of you tape.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:49]** Is there anything you want to write or say, Dr. O'Keefe and Colin, since you're standing next to them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:49 - 00:28:00]** In this case, Colin, he puts his hands across his chest and you see that his fingertips line up with the feathers of the wings of Sarenrae on his chest.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:05]** And he leaves the same memoir on both.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** The dawn brings new light.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:08]** Nice.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** Dr. O'Keefe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** Is it an open casket?

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:12]** No.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:14]** Stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** Where was that going to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:19]** I don't know.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** Do you want to know?

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** But we'll stay there.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** Do you want to know?

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:22]** Slimes all over it.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** Um, yeah, Dr. Okay.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:35]** He's going to just, um, I feel like he doesn't know them.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:37]** So like, sure.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:46]** He's going to politely decline, but he's, uh, he's somber and he wants to see them faced.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:49]** Like he wants to see the bodies at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** Hmm.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** Okay.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:53]** All of the crew put down memories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:56]** I'm gonna ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** Just be patient.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Just be patient.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** No, I'm not.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:07]** I literally was about to say, Hears and Rick, what do you want to... The other crew start to do that.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:13]** You all are there too, but at some point, do you write or put anything on there?

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:13]** Rick Hears?

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:14]** Go ahead, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** He hands it to him first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:21]** He just kind of puts his hand up and like, like, no, no, thank you.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:22]** Okay.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:26]** And, but he does, he, he's, he bows his head and he's thinking something to himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:27]** Okay.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:31]** Here's, here's, here's writes down your heart's gone home.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:34]** And also,

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** You're on your pilgrimage to Besmar's throne.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:39]** Shitty-ass pirate s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:41]** Did you say shitty-ass pirate s***?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** That's not shitty, that's cool.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:45]** Pirates are cool, Kevin.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:47]** Sorry, Kevin just said something.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:50]** One by one, a few of the crews start to leave.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Gnarla, as they're leaving, says...

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** Thank you all for coming.

**[00:29:55 - 00:30:04]** Soon after this, there will be sort of a group dinner where we can all come back together and celebrate them again and hopefully just enjoy the rest of our journey.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** People start to leave.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:11]** And that's the end of the funeral, as they say.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:14]** What do you all do in this moment?

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:17]** And I'm also going to invite you to transition.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:23]** If there's anything that you want your character to do in this downtime, start bringing that forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:27]** is going to wait in the storage room until everyone's gone.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:27]** Oh, my God.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** Okay.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** Interesting.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:56]** so it seems like dr okay just in the immediate time frame you're the only person left in there i'm going to slowly start to move people out what are you doing it's going to open up the caskets oh my god take his arm i think i think colin with his wisdom would say doctor that's that's in bad taste but as a researcher he's gonna cast grave words


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:01]** I mean, hey, I'm down for this for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Do you have grave words?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:08]** I learned it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** I'm going to stand and watch for sure.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:14]** Rick is out.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:17]** He comes up close to Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** He's like, do it.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:37]** I heard about this once, and he starts murmuring something that Yaris had taught him to contact, I guess, the, sorry, who's the god of, I mean, it's a necromantic spell, but I learned it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** So you open the first one.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:41]** There is an android.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:47]** The body of an android there seems to be presenting as a female.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:51]** Their body is largely injured.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:56]** Lots of little tiny cuts all over their body.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** Can you cast grave words twice a day?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** Yeah.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** It's a cantrip.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Okay.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:05]** But I just can't cast it on the same person more than once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** Right, okay.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:13]** And what's the, give me the, just the byline of the spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:18]** You can force a touched corpse to talk to you, but you can't ask specific questions or communicate with it at all.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:25]** The corpse utters random sentences for one round with a 10% chance of this information of some use to you.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:35]** Useful information might include warnings about dangers, a wrecked starship, password to unlock a computer, or the name of a supernatural creature seeking you or your allies.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:43]** GM makes a D percentage roll in secret and decides what information, useful or not, the corpse spews out in its babbling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:51]** For the record of everyone listening, you may know, but we've never yet rolled... It's never yet been successful.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:54]** It's always just been random stuff, so...

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:57]** This was the first time it was being used in our main game.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:01]** Yeah, it was used in Unknown Treasures by Will's other character.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** I love this spell.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** Yeah, he really likes it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Curious parents.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** I hate it.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:09]** You cast it on the android.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** You believe this is Melody.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:12]** Yeah.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:15]** And Melody's eyes open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** Okay.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** I'm in the room.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:21]** There's... Nothing.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** Nothing.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** Wait.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:23]** Wait.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** Wait.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** Wait.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** No.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:29]** What the f*** is that vending machine?

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:29]** Do...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:49]** oh no that's sad and funny at the same time the phantom machine phantasm mimic phantom machine oh it could be a mimic dude we just narrowly make it out of our lives it could be like the little it was like the little like sharon uh guy anyway little like plush what do you do do you shut that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:57]** Yeah, I shut the lid and I write on one of the silver strands, did not like grape Fanta.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:58]** Oh, I don't know.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** Here stops him while he's doing that.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** He's like, wait, wait one second.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:03]** And he's looking for any armor.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** Is there armor in there, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** You're going to loot the body?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:13]** Kelly, I'm just going to say that I don't think there's armor on the dead corpse.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** Okay.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:20]** It's just, it's buried in plain clothes for PC's sake.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:40]** uh so dr okay you walk over and you go to the next coffin yeah you open it this is apatra please don't let it be thaddeus i know you know that this is soren who was one of the peritons

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:51]** You feel that maybe here's especially there's a magic connection here that is intangible.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** And I don't know if Dr. O.K.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:59]** would just have a touch in on it because there's like a psychic resonance here that you can feel.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:01]** Can I roll something for that?

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:04]** No, it's just a general sense.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** Dr.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** O.K., you say your words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** I almost feel his presence in this room.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:11]** Is he a magic user, maybe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:14]** No, just hold on a sec.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:17]** You feel like the aftereffects of a psychic effect.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** Here's Dr.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:24]** O.K., you cast grave words, and the posture of his body is fine.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** Their eyes open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Hi.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:28]** All right.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:30]** Okay.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:32]** Everything seems to be fine.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** All right.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:36]** Yeah.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:36]** I know.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** That's what I'm thinking, too.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** It's unusual.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:41]** It doesn't feel... What?

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** Sorry.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:47]** Is that... Does that gray have a... Is that gray on all fours?

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** We have a situation here.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** We have a conflict.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:52]** Is this gray... Ah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** Oh, no, the Greybounder.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:54]** Close their eyes.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:59]** You think that the Greybounder psychically attacked them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Dang it.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** That sucks.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:01]** Ouch.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** Greybounder is terrifying.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** We got revenge for you.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** We took care of it for you.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:08]** Did we, though?

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:09]** We did.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** We killed that Greybounder.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** Did we?

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:11]** We did.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** I promise.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:17]** Do you want to give me a check, Doctor, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** No, I mean, a check on what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:22]** No, I mean, you could give me, like, a wisdom or intelligence check.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** Sure, I guess.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** Intelligence?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:31]** I love these moments because it's like, I really want to tell you this, but please roll a check to see if I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** Does an 18 do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:37]** Yeah, you just remember that they were in a separate part of the facility.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** You bet your ass it does.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:42]** Yeah, it was a different gray bounder, which thankfully we didn't run into.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:49]** And they all yeeted into a green blink of non-existent existence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:50]** It's dead now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:57]** I hope that no more bounders haunt us or you.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:59]** I hope so, too.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:03]** Farewell, Oren and Dr. O'K.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:06]** Close the casket as respectfully as possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** And, uh, leaves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:12]** I have to say, I just wasn't sure what that was going to go.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:14]** And I went with it and I trust you all.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** And no, this is a real, this is a compliment.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:18]** I like it ended in a respectful way.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:26]** And I know you're curious at first, but just giving a kudos to you, Dr. K and to you here's just for turning that into a nice moment.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Likewise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:31]** I really wanted to get some information about what we're doing on this ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:37]** Well, just keep rolling great words over and over and over.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** You'll get something eventually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:48]** I learned it in a dream as I was aboard this ship, and I thought, well, maybe try it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:51]** It's really cool that you could just pick up new skills in your dream.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:52]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:53]** Yeah.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** It seemed like a dream.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:58]** It seemed like it was happening right before my eyes, like a waking dream.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:00]** That's cool.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:04]** I'm just discovering this inkling.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:04]** Yeah?

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:05]** Like what?

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:12]** Intimistic things beyond just biomechanics, genetics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:21]** You feel like you're getting in touch with the mystic nature of the universe beyond the hard science that you're trained in, right?

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** This is new for you, isn't it?

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:44]** that's cool you hear i can if you have any questions let me know here colin or call from the hallway oh yeah like what you missed it colin it's okay there'll be other opportunities hopefully maybe not with rick around you never know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:48 - 00:39:12]** uh so true okay yeah big boy so the rest of the day the dinner goes very well it's more lavish you can tell they pulled some special things out of stores again trying to recreate that first night now that you have some there are no threats or anything you're not under any danger there everyone seems relaxed uh

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:18]** And the next couple of days start to pass pretty uneventfully as well.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:21]** Is there anything that anyone wants to share?

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:23]** What are you doing during this downtime?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:30]** Not to keep stretching this freaking armor thing, but here's really needs better armor.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:45]** So like, can we go and he's interested in maybe picking up the armor that might be left behind by these dearly departed stewards or would like to ask if when we land, if he could buy some because he doesn't want to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** You don't want to just ask the stewards if they have extra armor?

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:49]** You want to go steal somebody's?

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** It has to come off the body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** I want the solution to be extremely convoluted.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** That's what I want.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** I should probably do what you're saying.

**[00:39:56 - 00:40:00]** All right, so he's going to ask someone that when he can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:03]** I think it makes sense for here's to default to piracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** It's how I play games.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:10]** All I did in Skyrim was just steal the entire time.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:12]** That's how I made all my money.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** I'm with you on that.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** I was a Khajiit, can you tell?

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:17]** I love cats and stealing things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:18]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:22]** In Fallout, I would sell everything and then steal it back.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** Or just steal the coins because the coins are always easier to steal.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:29]** So you just steal all the money and then buy whatever you need.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:33]** They're fine to give you some armor, whatever they get there.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** It's not a problem.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:40]** They can see what they have and try and work something out.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Appreciate it.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** Shay makes a note about that.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Thank you, Shay.

**[00:40:45 - 00:41:11]** yeah um everyone on the crew just so you know is like very friendly and apologetic to you kaniko you can tell is like always talking you up to shay and narla she's like they need to get a reward like they need they deserve a lot of recognition for what they did here friendly and apologetic which like sure if i scuffed your shoe makes sense but like i tried to kill you yeah they are like they are

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:17]** coming to terms with that and trying to figure out... Generally mortified by the fact that they... Yeah.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:19]** They're trying to make amends.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:23]** They're trying to welcome you to take a totally different tack.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:25]** And they're trying to take it seriously.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:28]** They seem like they care about you all and your well-being.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:30]** Okay.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:30]** Piers?

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:36]** Piers is going to... He's learned to trust some of these people, particularly Shay.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:38]** So he's going to ask Shay for a moment of privacy.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** If you can get him.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** Shay, I have something.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** Oh, okay.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:47]** I have something I want to show you.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:53]** And I know that the stewards, you looked up my previous history with you, right?

**[00:41:53 - 00:42:01]** I know that I mentioned that before we boarded, but you know about my previous communications with your higher ups.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:05]** I know you have a lot of connections and a lot of huge knowledge base.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** I wanted to ask you about this.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** And he pulls out the puck.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** And like unravels the wrapper.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:15]** And as it glows blue, he's like, a friend of mine gave this to me.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:20]** He died before he could tell me what it was for, why it would be useful.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:22]** But it is supposed to be useful to me.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:25]** I just don't know what it is.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:28]** And we've encountered some...

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:44]** alloys before that when they're near it interact with it and glow that's kind of all that I have to go on but I'm wondering if you might know about it or if anyone you know might know about it and he kind of lets him look at it for a bit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:48]** Yeah, he is very excited to hold it.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:53]** He seems like this is really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:55]** He's like... The appropriate amount of excited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** Please, please keep this between us.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** Okay.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:02]** He's like... It's like he's an enthusiast.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** He's into this.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:06]** He's like, I don't think I've ever seen anything like this.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:08]** He's really into minerals.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:11]** Can I have Melt Man scan it?

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** All right.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:13]** Uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:15]** I don't want to take it from you.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** No, no, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:19]** I'm trying to take your stuff.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:19]** Okay.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:19]** Hold on.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** No, no, no.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:20]** Listen, listen.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:21]** I think that's good.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** I need this information.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** So as much as I can get.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:28]** So could we get Meltaman to, could I do it?

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** Could I be there when you do it with him?

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** Sure.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:34]** And will Meltaman keep this information contained?

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:37]** I don't know if he's part of some larger network or whatever.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** If he's off grid, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:43]** I mean, look, putting data on anything is always going to be a risk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** So if you don't want to do that, we don't have to do it.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** It's fine.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:49]** There's only a little bit of time left on this ship.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** I just need you to keep it between us, please.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Let's get Melty Man.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:53]** All right.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** All right.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** All right.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** So Melty Man comes over, scans it.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** Not any immediate results that you can tell.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:05]** It comes up unidentifiable in some.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:08]** Like, you know, like there are parameters that you see.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Some are filled out.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** Some are...

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:29]** blank can't identify it um I will continue to research this so and then yeah yeah okay just uh yeah there's not a lot that you can tell about it from melt demands understanding yeah

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** Look, I'm going to do my best.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:33]** I can try and research something like this.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** Sorry, your friend gave this to you.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:36]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** Okay.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:39]** Yeah.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:40]** Where?

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Did they say anything about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:45]** I'm just trying to put some more pieces together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:47]** Shay, uh...

**[00:44:47 - 00:45:00]** Your higher-ups know already I don't really care, but I was a captain in the Free Captains, and I'd like to make my way back into that.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:07]** I was just told that it would help me do that, and I don't know if it points to some star map or something else.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:13]** I know it's reactive to other components that we found in our time on that research center.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** That's all I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** Okay.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:18]** Meltaman, take note of that.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** Can you tell Meltaman what it was reactive to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:26]** Here's... Does he still have it on his... I'm trying to remember if he has one of those materials.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** I think he does, right?

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:31]** The little, like, things that glow blue that... Well, there's both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:32]** Yeah.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** Well, yeah.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** I think you have both.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** So, there's the device.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:42]** Here shows them to both Meltaman and Shay.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:42]** This.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** Oh, wow.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** Okay.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:44]** Yeah.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** Melt-A-Man cataloged this too.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** This is fascinating.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:56]** And then takes a video scans the, uh, cause I believe it was like two pieces of metal that you had that had like writing on it and stuff like scans all of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:56]** Right.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:59]** I hope this isn't a mistake doing this, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** I'm kind of mad.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:02]** You never revealed to us that you were a free captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Well, okay, the stewards know.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:14]** Because if you remember at the beginning of Unknown Treasures, here's when he goes on one of the narrator's ships to do what he does.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:17]** The stewards pick up that stuff.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** So they know.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:20]** The stewards know.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:22]** I don't care if Shay knows, personally.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** Okay.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:24]** Yeah.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:30]** Plus, remember, sorry, just, like, before we came on this ship, Hears said, look up my records.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** So they know who Hears is.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:32]** He knows.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:36]** I mean, look, we've not been on the ship too long.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** I'll continue to look it up.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:42]** But yeah, we'll take this offline on the base.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** Rick, this did happen in book two.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** Like, he was brought it up.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:48]** Yeah, the stewards thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** Oh, this isn't Rick talking.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** This is Kevin talking.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:54]** I'm just saying you haven't revealed that you were a free captain directly to the three of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** Hold your horses.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** It just takes time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** Just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** What is...

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:02]** Okay, so you have that conversation with Shay.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** Kind of disappointed, but whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** Like, cool.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:06]** Hopefully something happens.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:06]** Dang it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** They don't know.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:12]** Anybody else have anything that they are doing or want to mention or share during these next five days?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:19]** I think overall, casually over the next few days, Rick is definitely just probing about the stewards.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:29]** The closest he's gotten to the stewards before was the interaction with the officer right before he boarded the Chimera.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:35]** But he's always admired the stewards, and he's always wanted to become a steward.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:38]** And so he's just kind of probing that aspect of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Yeah.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:41]** You're talking with the Pykes Paratonians.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** They're telling you stories about working with the stewards.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** You're talking with Narla and Shay.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:52]** They're telling you about what, like, just the different branches and how the hierarchy works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:55]** Have they ever seen any ghosts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Right.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:58]** Yeah.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** Okay, cool.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** That's very on-brand for Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:07]** One more thing to point out is he still is kind of... He's not completely sold on the Pikes Paradons.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:10]** And I know Orvier was like, you'd make a great Pike.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:15]** But I think anytime that avenue kind of comes up, Rick is very quickly to like...

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** Yeah, okay, cool.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** Moving on.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:20]** He's kind of not interested in the Pykes at all.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** He's interested in being a steward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:22]** Justice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** Justice.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** That's right.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** I like it.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Makes sense.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** You all are doing your thing.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:30]** Anybody else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Uh, Dr. Okay.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:38]** He's going to spend this time looking into the, whatever he can look at as far as like the ship's logs.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:39]** Yeah.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:47]** And, um, I guess he's trying to like piece together why or how, uh, the void crier came to be at Omicron.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:51]** And also like, if there were any, like, why was it a target?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** How was Omicron on the radar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** You don't have any.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** Yeah.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** You don't have any information on that.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** That's not on the ship's logs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:03]** So I don't even know what like missions they've been on or just like, I don't see anything.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:04]** No.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** Yeah.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:09]** They're not going to have that just available to look at or see.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** What if he rolls a hella high computers check?

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Cause I can help him.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** No.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:13]** Still then.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:13]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:16]** What if I, what if I convince them to just give it to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:24]** I don't think they're going to give you that, but if you want to ask them why they have come to figure that out.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:24]** Sure.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** Yeah.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** I'll, I'll ask Narla.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:29]** You just, you just straight up mission.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** Like, what was your mission at Omicron?

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:35]** How did you come to seek out these greys anyhow?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:41]** I wish I could tell you more specifics, but they have sabotaged the stewards before.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:44]** This was a, let's just say, targeted mission.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** They are devious.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** They are cunning.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** You never know that they're there until it's happening.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** And we thought, you know what?

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:55]** If we can take this to them, let's do it.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** That's all I'm at liberty to say right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:12]** good question though I like it yeah does seem like can I roll sense motive on that yeah sure would you roll 14 okay she seems like she hates the grace she hates the grace yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:37]** lot of vitriol there so yeah all the all that you found in the files were just like administrative records like there's nothing about missions there's like flight it's like just like flight specifics data yeah no copies of outgoing communications um things are pretty wiped clean there's a lot of hygiene to keep their their data secret gunship

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:42]** Yeah, you think if the vessel fell into enemy hands, they would not want any way to get into anything, right?

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** Colin, I think I interrupted you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:47]** Good for them for effective data governance practices.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Do what they did, kids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Do what the stewards do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:57]** I think for those five days, Colin makes himself useful in the MedBay area.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:58]** Yeah.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:20]** but also similar to like a um shoe shine might be he keeps his ear to the um ear to the ground to figure out what he might pick up through osmosis or a loose lip or anything love it that that one of the puritans or anything else sink ships yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:23]** I think there are two things that come up.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:33]** Shay at one point talks about how Gnarla seems a little clumsy.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:57]** it's just like just like they're like talking once and she's like yeah i've just noticed you've been even like knocking things over and like you keep missing putting in logs and stuff like that that's just just weird yeah just like not in like a bad way gnarly's just complaining like i cut cut my hand on that glass and

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:22]** breakfast and she's like yeah you've been knocking things over like you need to right but only only since the gray encounter you don't know enough to know uh the other thing you notice is that torv is talking with somebody a little just feels like the funeral was very nice but a little like brief on orvier's part

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:28]** Torv was one of the people who actually... Let's see, it was... Who was it?

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:36]** It was Kaniko, who was really close with Melody, and it was Hesper, who was really close with Sorin.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:41]** But Sorin and Hesper and Torv were friends, so...

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:49]** Hesper and Torv were talking and Torv was like, yeah, I feel like Orvir didn't say enough about them.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:52]** Orvir's brief, but just wish he would have said a little more.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** That's it.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** That's all that you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:07]** I don't know that Colin knows them well enough to sense their motives, but he would definitely log that in his notebook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:08]** That's cool.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:09]** I like it.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:12]** Okay, so let's keep going.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:14]** Day four happens.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:14]** Day three, day four.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:16]** Day five.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:21]** And Narla buzzes before you and says...

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:23]** Hey, we're about to be, uh, oh, that was Shay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:32]** Uh, we're about to be coming into, uh, coming into Varos if you all want to come up to the bridge and get a good look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:32]** Aye.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:36]** That sounds, um, pretty interesting.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:43]** And Colin steps into the elevator platform, find my mouse, and heads up to the bridge.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:50]** Finding it very crowded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:54]** Yeah, there's a lot of people here.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:57]** Colin looks to his left and says, Hello, Melt-A-Man.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:00]** Oh, hello, Colin.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** Totally lost that you're making fun of Melt-A-Man.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** It's good to see you, Colin.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:07]** Good to see you too, Melt-A-Man.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** Okay.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** What does anybody else?

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** It offers a genuine smile.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:15]** And Melted Man doesn't smile.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:20]** They don't smile.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:20]** Good stuff.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** Okay.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Anybody else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:30]** just sort of walks around the bridge, the consoles that he once operated.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** Yeah.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:38]** And just sort of, you know, gives it a nice glance, maybe a loving tap, like, you did pretty well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** That's cool.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** There's a connection that you all have.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** Yeah.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** With the Void Crier.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** That's neat.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:47]** Okay.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** You...

**[00:54:50 - 00:55:00]** The screen becomes brightly colored again as this tear begins to open and you move out of the drift.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:17]** And the Voidcrier, the bridge is immediately filled, the entire window, with this blue and purple swirling clouds that are quilted over the planet that you know as Rathida.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:27]** They move with a familiar but alien motion, like how a flame might flicker, and you can't really pull your eyes away.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:40]** In the corner, you notice a fiery, angry red circle that's growing larger and larger, slowly centering itself on the screen.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:45]** This is Varos.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:48]** Volcano Moon of Brithida.

**[00:55:49 - 00:56:02]** As you begin to enter the thick atmosphere, it's tough to tell where the reentry heat and the surface heat waves separate because the heat from the moon is everywhere.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:19]** Maybe it's your mind, but you start to maybe feel like your armor is breathing hot air into your body and outside you see black rock badlands extend for miles beyond that are broken by these pools of fiery lava.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:21]** You start to float down over the surface.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:31]** You see these large horn gray creatures running alongside deep, boiling, churning red lava flows, cutting the landscape.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:39]** You veer to port to more rocky, trackless land dotted with more of these feisty pools of spewing lava.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:48]** The occasional dilapidated buildings long evacuated and left to the extreme heat of the burning moon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:48 - 00:57:10]** someone give me a physical science or culture check i'll do a physical science yeah i'll do culture because i don't have physical science love it uh i'll do physical science as well for a 23 23 i'm never rolling on hero lab again 15 15 on physical science that's a 19 on the die for 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:16]** Okay, Dr. Okay, you realize and remember, no pure water exists on the surface of Veros.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:25]** It is so hot that instead, sulfurous pools of steaming, stinking mud will bubble to the surface.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:32]** and sublimate and leave behind all this, like, flammable residue, this gooey residue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** That Beerus is so hot right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:35]** Colin... Dude, it's so hot.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:39]** Colin and Hears, you remember that.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:39]** Facts.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Beerus...

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:56]** is dotted with these small facilities that dot the very hostile landscape, including prisons that are operated by the Barthedon government, where prisoners serve hard sentences of hard labor.

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:01]** It's often called the death moon because people don't leave.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:18]** Minutes later, you crest a featureless hill and see the rectangular, brutalist, gray-black buildings of the Steward's Base sitting on a sturdy platform, as you can see in Foundry, over a large lava pool.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:34]** the three dark buildings look emotionless and yet ablaze the walls sitting silently while the windows like red eyes reflect the ire of the living volcano pools meet you

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:41]** And above it all, the blue and gold of the Steward symbol is projected holographically into the sky atop a little tower.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:49]** There's an opening off to the left, like a little mouth, revealing a shielded hangar on the left side of the platform.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:57]** You can see another ship, the model, different model, similar size, and you're headed to land in the port right next to it.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:02]** Welcome to Tyr Calus Base.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:05]** on the volcano moon of Brithida.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** That is our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:10]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:16]** We're finally off of a ship and onto a real planet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:19]** We're on a ship that has an asteroid.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** We don't actually know this.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** We're getting better.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** It's still a base.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:27]** It still could be that nothing is as it seems.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:30]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:30]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** But...

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** We're making progress.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:36]** Let's hope the base is not another, like, proving ground or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:39]** I mean, we've literally landed on hell, but sure, yeah.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:39]** Or a dungeon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:43]** Nothing will go wrong, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:44]** This will be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** It's going to be smooth sailing from here on out.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:46]** Yeah.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:46]** This is fine.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:48]** They're going to have a gift shop.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:49]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:51]** They're going to have a... They're going to have a lot.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** A gift shop would be nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:54]** Maybe a nice spa day.
