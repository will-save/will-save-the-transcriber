**[00:00:01 - 00:00:24]** Previously, on We'll Save...

**[00:00:24 - 00:00:34]** With the team in tow, they tread down to the bottom deck, where Rick reaches to reveal a reclusive resident reclining in the ship's rec room.

**[00:00:34 - 00:00:37]** Will they rally in reason with a roused Orvir?

**[00:00:38 - 00:00:46]** Or risk ruin from a rage-filled remote-controlled pugilist puppeteered by pernicious paranormal poltergeists?

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:50]** Find out this time on Will Save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:37]** You have come to the right place at the right time.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:41]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** We'll save.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:42]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:46]** I am your armor swapping GM, John Swan.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** And Kevin, we want to know.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** We want to know right now.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** Don't hold back.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:54]** Did you see any ghosts at Dunsky Estate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:55]** Yeah, here we go.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** Tell us.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** You've got to bleep out Dunsky now.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Why?

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Why?

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:03]** So what I learned... I would rep them.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** I know, but they don't want to be known as haunted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** They're not haunted, everyone.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:12]** This is a total fabrication from Kevin Decker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:14]** This is all fabrication on my mind.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:29]** But for the listener, the five of us flew to the land of unicorns, Scotland, to see the royal wedding of the Lord and Lady Spinner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** Lord and lady of the lock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:37]** My goal while we were there, we were staying in this estate.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** It was a castle.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** It wasn't a castle.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** It was pretty castle-like.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** It was an estate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:47]** It was a modern estate.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** It's dope.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** It's very cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:50 - 00:03:00]** It's not a castle because the castle was torn down after a maid threw one of the babies out the window in the 1700s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** I got all sorts of history on this place.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** We can get into that later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:07]** You can believe Kevin knows about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:12]** My goal when I got off that bus was to find... I didn't want to see a ghost myself.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** Well, I do want to see a ghost myself.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** That's a lie if I decide otherwise.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** But I don't necessarily believe in ghosts.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** That's a long, complicated story.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:26]** I'm very cynical, and I believe in physics, and ghosts do not abide by physics.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** But...

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:33]** I wanted to know if anybody in the home of the estate had seen any ghosts.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:36]** I wanted to know if there were ghost stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** I love ghost stories.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:40]** He pressed this the entire trip.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:42]** I didn't mean to.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:46]** This place has a staff of 40 people or something.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Literally every single one of them.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** It was Downton Abbey.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:51]** We were the people that lived in Downton Abbey for four days.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:52]** Thank you, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** It was quite...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:55 - 00:04:11]** smashing yeah yeah it was it was delightful day one yes kevin from day one was like all right like you know he kept poking at people being like are there ghosts here are there ghosts here are you sure i know these scottish people like no no no no


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:35]** the woman that walked me up to my room to show me where our room was i asked her first so she was literally the first i was the first staff member i spoke to i was like hey you got any ghost stories and this is what she said she said like there are there are stories of a woman that walks the hall at night uh but she has never seen it and i was like oh this is a good start

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:42]** Then the next person I spoke to was one of the younger staff members, which I actually kind of got buddy buddy with him towards the end.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:49]** And I got some personal ghost stories from him later on from his like home, which were creepy as so good.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** Anyways.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Really?

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:51]** Not Gavin.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:53]** Who?

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:53]** It was Gavin.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** Not Gavin.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** No, it wasn't Gavin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** No, Gavin was there for part of it, though.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** It was that younger guy.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** Is it Blair or Blake?

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** Blair's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:03]** Blair, because he's the son of the chef.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:03]** Yeah.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** Yeah, and I know about the chef.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:09]** But anyway, because the chef's a ghost, but that's besides the point.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:11]** So he told me, he was like, oh, I'll tell you in secret.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:15]** And in secret, I kind of got cornered and I was like, hey, it's secret enough.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** And he was like, there's no ghosts here.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:17]** Not at all.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** And I was like, oh, man.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:22]** And then I talked to... But there's demons.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:23]** Alistair.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:26]** Alistair is the owner of the home.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:30]** And Alistair was like, oh, so here's what happened.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:41]** My wife, who is also an owner and she was the one that runs the show, she one night came out and said there was this ghost that she saw a ghost that walked the hall.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** late at night and she doesn't make up stories.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** So it had to be real.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:49]** And then three days later, I told everybody that it was just a joke.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** So after that, I was like, oh, there's no gun stories here.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** It's done.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** But I kept poking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:54 - 00:06:01]** So then we waited until like 1130 at night to go do this hedge maze and turn the flashlights off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** We did it.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** We did it.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:08]** And because of a Ronald McDonald cartoon, we managed to find the way to get to the middle by hugging the left side all the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:10]** I haven't heard this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:14]** That's how you find your way out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:14]** Years ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:17]** You remember when you were texting us to like, hey, come back.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** There's a surprise.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Yeah.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** This is what we were doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:27]** We were stuck in a maze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** We couldn't find our way out in time.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** I'm sorry, John.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:34]** But basically, this is so much of a tangent, but there was a Ronald McDonald cartoon I saw years ago.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:37]** And so I was like, all right, let's hug the left side of the maze to see if we can get to the center.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** And it worked.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:42]** But then we abandoned Vinny halfway there, I think.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** And then Vinny...

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:48]** We were just like in the middle of the hedge maze and Vinny's just like a flashlight pointing in every direction like where is everyone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:49 - 00:07:05]** I somehow figured out how to get from where I was back to the entrance of the maze while everyone's waiting for me in the middle


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** This is the perfect setup for a horror movie.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:17]** Yeah, so there were so many creepy things that were happening, but Kevin, every single day, you were asking, like, everyone that worked there, like, ghost, ghost, ghost, and on the final night, I think, they finally admitted it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:19]** I was getting, like, what's it called?

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:21]** I was getting different stories from different people.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** I was like, wait a minute, this isn't right.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:35]** And so what I finally got, and it was the last night, and I'm not going to reveal who said it, but somebody told me that they were told by the Dunskies, by the bleep, bleep, bleep estate, um, not...

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:39]** to talk about ghosts because they don't want to be labeled as a haunted mansion.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** Interesting choice.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:50]** That person told me that they themselves witnessed the woman walking the hall right by the bear at the front door.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:59]** Just for our listeners, when you walk through into the main entrance, there is literally a grizzly bear that stands probably six feet tall holding a platter.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:02]** Like, it's a taxidermied bear holding a pot of space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:08]** I mean, the bear is only really, like, four and a half feet, but... But it's tough when... Yeah, Kev's... It's... Yeah.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** Things appear a lot taller than they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** That's true.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** Kevin... Yeah.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** Sometimes you do, like...

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:17]** Kevin's a short man with tall tales.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** Short king with tall tales.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:28]** So that person said they saw the woman that walks the hall.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:31]** And that hall is that entryway where the bear is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:34]** Yeah, I still think they were just pulling your leg.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** You think it was the bear pulling my leg?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** But here's the thing.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:43]** They would have to be mastermind game mind player, like whatever the f*** they say.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** Whatever they say.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** There's a phrase for that.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** Who is that?

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** Okay, the people that worked at this place.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** Because, like, okay, I saw this happen.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:55]** Like, you were all playing that one pool table game where you're all trying to, like, kill each other.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:55]** Yeah, pool walls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:57]** Yeah, that was fun as f***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** And then, or snicker or whatever the hell.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** And then like Kevin.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** No, we don't.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:07]** I would pass by like going from one thing to another.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:13]** And like the first time I passed by, like Kevin was just talking to like one of the Scotsman that worked at that place.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** And then the Scotsman was just like getting really into it.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:18]** And Kevin was like, no, there was this one ghost story, this one ghost story and whatever.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:21]** And then I would come by like an hour later and he would still be talking about it.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:23]** But there would be like two Scotsman then.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:28]** And then I think at one point there were three people listening to Kevin like talk about like ghosts.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:31]** And then all of their eyes were like as wide as saucers.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:33]** And then they were telling their own ghost stories.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:36]** And then like Kevin, Kevin can make people talk about anything.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:38]** That's just how he is.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:43]** So then I gained a lot of respect for Kevin that night because I just saw he just transformed these people.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:46]** It was like they were around a campfire.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:49]** They were like kids in a candy store just listening to Kevin.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** I even got ghost stories out of John's dad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** They admitted everything to him.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** It was amazing.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:58]** John's dad told me his ghost story and John's dad listened to my ghost stories.

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:00]** I don't think I've heard John's dad's ghost story.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** Is it the one about the car?

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:02]** Yeah.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:06]** He sees like a 1930s car roll up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** And somebody entered the house that they're staying in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:08]** Yeah.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:15]** So the camp in Maine is was built by like my dad's grandfather's father.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** And we saw it.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:17]** It's beautiful.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:21]** And at one night.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:27]** There's a long camp road that comes down to the yard, which is just like dirt where people pull in and park.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:31]** And the back porch is the porch that doesn't face the lake.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** So the back porch faces the car yard.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** And one night, him and his friend are just hanging out.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** And when it's dark in Maine, we talked about this last episode.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:40]** It's that part of the country.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** It's like when it's dark and there's no lights, it's dark.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** It's real dark.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:50]** And they see a car coming down the road that looks like it is.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** Like, from the 20s.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:55]** It's like a Model A, Model T. And they're like, this is strange.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:59]** And this is in, like, the, what, the, I think, 60s or early 70s.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:02]** So they're like, maybe this is some old person rolling up.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Hot rod culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:04]** Yeah.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** Right.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:12]** And he said the weird part was the man that got out of the car had one of the emergency lanterns.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:12]** Yes.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:16]** Which, they still have these lanterns around, but nobody uses them normally.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** What, Scooby-Doo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** The villains?

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** That kind of lantern?

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:23]** Or like a 1920s non-electrical society.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:24]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:26]** And so they walk up.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:28]** And the thing is that it's a covered porch.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:32]** But the door to the porch is just notoriously like you open it and then it just swings shut.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** And they walk up.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** Two people get out of the car.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** They walk up.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Walk in.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** Door slams.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** And everyone else is inside.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** And there's another door that goes in.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** And there's glass.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:45]** You can see that lights are on.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:45]** People are moving.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** They open the door and they walk in.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:50]** And they're like, what the f*** was that?

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:55]** So then they run inside and they're like, where are they?

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:58]** Who just rolled up to our thing this summer?

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** Yeah, what is going on?

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** And they're like, what are you talking about?

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** Nobody came in.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** No one has come inside.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** You were the only people outside.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:08]** And then they went back out and the car wasn't there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** Never existed.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:10]** Drugs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** When was this again?

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:12]** 60s, 70s?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:15]** No, he said they were like, this is like when they were like kids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:20]** It wasn't as long before they... JK, it could have been a real... I don't not believe your dad.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:20]** That's crazy.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** Yeah.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:22]** That's weird.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:22]** Wow.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:23]** That's weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:28]** And it's interesting because like my ghost story, I have a ghost story from my house that I lived in when I was a teenager.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** I'm not gonna tell it now.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:30]** It's too long.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** But...

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** I think I've told that story.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** You've told the story on the podcast.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** The chair story or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** The whole story?

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:37]** I don't know.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:38]** Yeah.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:39]** That's fine.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:43]** But like my, my story, I've told that story a million times over the last 20 years.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:49]** And I finally correlated it with my parents, my mom, that she experienced it too.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:57]** And my friend that was with me the night that my mom realized that there, that she, that I wasn't fucking around, that these are real events that are happening in the house.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:58]** And my,

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:04]** And I was just messaging my friend because his son was born at the same time as my daughter.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:07]** So I was like, hey, man, congratulations on the kid, blah, blah.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:10]** By the way, do you remember this night 20 years ago?

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:14]** I relive it every single night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:20]** You just had a very positive life-changing event.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** And then you're just like, well, congrats on the kid.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:24]** By the way, can I rewind time to 20 fucking years ago?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:29]** Can I remind you of the time that you dearly shit yourself on my living room floor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:31]** He just got married.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** And we talked about it.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:34]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:51]** but yes he was my best friend at the time so it makes sense that we can just like you know pick up where you left off it does make sense it does but he he said he said he he remembers it kev walks up to john on his wedding day he's like hey congratulations


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:55]** By the way, it was late night at USC one time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:59]** Let's discuss this harrowing event that you've probably tried to forget.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:02]** I'm sorry, Kevin.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:04]** He remembered.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:14]** It's funny because my mom and him both, they remember the night and they remember the events, but they debate small, irrelevant details.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:25]** Like the thing that like him and I were playing the story is like him and I were playing video games and my mom screamed and we stepped out and looked down at her and she turned white because she thought we had touched her shoulder.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** But we're the only ones in the house.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** He remembers all of that.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:32]** What we debated was whether or not we were playing Diablo.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:35]** or Gauntlet Legends.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** That was the debate.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** What game were we playing?

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:41]** Not that all this other weird stuff had happened.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:46]** You were both inhabiting a parallel dimension and you crossed over.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:48]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** Wow.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** Only the Council of Will's would know this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:54]** You actually encountered yourself as a ghost.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** Dude, I like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** I was in the room playing with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** In a different plane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** Ask Will how he knows this answer.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** I was playing with myself.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Is that what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:05]** It's the Council of Will's.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:08]** It's the Council of Will's.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** What if it was Will's?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** Will's saying that I was sitting in a room playing with myself.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:14]** But also space and dimensions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** This is some Tenet stuff.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** With friends.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:17]** Watch.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:19]** Watch Tenet.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:19]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** Good stuff.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:28]** That banter was not as long as last episode's banter, which I guess is good.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:30]** Sorry for everyone who only listens to us for banter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:36]** But congrats on getting a longer banter last week than we intended.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:43]** By the way, do you remember that time 15 years ago when you had this really creepy thing happen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** That's what I'm going to bring up.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** Speaking of harrowing, creepy events.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:49 - 00:16:09]** In the aftermath, in the aftermath of your fight with the, uh, Pike's Puritans contractors, as you are, you know, taking armor, impersonating people, putting them in the brig, uh, making friends and trading names.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** Yeah.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** Yeah.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** And doing that stuff.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** It's like, you know what?

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:13]** God,

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** Where is my relax you?

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:15]** I need that.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** Dr. K is like, hey, guys, I'll be back.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** In fact, I don't even know that you said that.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:22]** You just were like, yeah, no, I'm out.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** OK, cool.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:31]** Hey, guys, you probably go down as you're getting it off of or got or here's.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** I can't really tell.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** I'm not sure who is who out of their room.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:42]** Then as you are leaving, a light comes on in the galley down the hall.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:44]** You think you hear TV.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:45]** It's weird.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:51]** You're like, nope, I'm out.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:54]** But I love that you went back up and you're like, hey, I found a relaxing.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:57]** Hey, by the way, I heard this weird noise, but it's cool.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** We could investigate it or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Let's go with not.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** Meanwhile, standing at the doorway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:13]** Smash cut to Rick 19 standing at the doorway of the galley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** And honestly, that's going to be our recap.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** You guys are like, let's go.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:21]** After the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:23]** After Orr got put on his armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:27]** After Orr got put on her armor and opened every door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** What is Orgott but a concept?

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:37]** I'm Orgott.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:37]** You're Orgott.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** We are all Orgott.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:47]** We all just have the name tags and shit.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:52]** It's a real Orgott situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:58]** Cut back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** to Rick19.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** I'm going to unpause the game.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:07]** We are here in Foundry as Rick19 is standing looking into the galley.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:12]** but only slightly because most of your vision is taken up by the light.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:19]** It's like when there's one single TV in a dark room and the TV is moving and the lights illuminating things and then taking it away.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:19]** Yeah.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:24]** Behind him are Bernice and Dr. Okay, Colin.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:27]** And then here's the situation.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:35]** And can he go breeze watching your rear brick 19?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:35]** Yeah.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** Take a good look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** You see a figure.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** Low to the ground.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** On the left side of the room.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:48]** You can't quite make it out because there's the table, there's the shadow.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:50]** I'm not quite sure.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:50]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:56]** So this room, it's the cruise mess, right?

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** This is where we were watching the game.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** This is where all the chairs were out.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:05]** It comes kind of to a peak on the left side because that's following the shape of the hull of the ship.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:11]** So you're saying it's at the tip of that as it merges into a corner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:11]** Yeah.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:14]** No, it's on the left side of the room.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:17]** So the door is on the far right of the room.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:21]** It essentially butts against the right wall, right?

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:24]** You're entering from the right corner, top right corner.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:37]** It's somewhere over to the bottom left area between what you recall is the sink and the cupboards where they keep the hydroponics and the plants and all that stuff and the table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** So can I ping an area and you'll let me know?

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** If you're talking like here-ish?

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** How do you ping in this game?

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:45]** Yeah, just click and hold.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Somewhere in this area.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** Oh, okay.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** So I'm going to roll perception.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:55]** And that rolled off the table, so I'll roll again.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:59]** Ooh, that's a six on the dice for a total of, I think, 13?

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** Can't really tell.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** Shape is...

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:21]** low to the ground kind of large you're like peeking in you think you recognize some of the the armor you think maybe it's argot like metal metal armor


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** What does that mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:25]** Wait, you could just see armor?

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:27]** Is that right, Kevin?

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:29]** Just a little tiny armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:31]** Yeah, you think... Just tiny armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** Is it what I think it is?

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:37]** It seems like a figure is low.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:39]** The figure doesn't seem small.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:44]** It feels like... It looks like they're low and they're more against the table.

**[00:20:44 - 00:21:07]** please don't be what i think it is like they're sitting on the ground like they're on the ground against but between the table and the like a mink i don't want it to be a skin and the sink i don't want to be a skater you kind of recognize the armor though like it like it looks kind of familiar but you're like uh can i roll like a culture check for that armor


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** Who's missing?

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:09]** Orvier.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:13]** Orvier's the only one we left that we didn't tie up somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:16]** Did Orvier have this kind of armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** I don't recall.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:21]** Give me an intelligence roll, Rick19.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:24]** Intelligence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:27]** Just kick in the door, wave in the 4-4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** Intelligence is low.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** but I rolled pretty good.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:34]** That's a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** That delivery.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** I like the delivery.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:43]** I wish I got the reference, but it's really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** I missed it.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** I was too busy rolling intelligence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:50]** I feel like that is one thing Will and I are always good for each other for, an obscure reference.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:57]** 17 for intelligence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:00]** 17 for intelligence.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:01]** 17.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** Yeah, it looks really heavy.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** It looks like it.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** It seems like maybe Orvir's armor.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:10]** You think, oh yeah, I would recognize that anywhere.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:14]** This is like, this is some serious, some serious armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** Hmm.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** Hi, Doctor.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:17]** Ah.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:20]** You, uh... Hey, here's... Do you have that injection ready?

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Yeah, it's, um, back here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:23]** Right here.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** What's up, uh, Rick?

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** I think you might like the armor on this creature in here.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:29]** Oh, really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:33]** Is it better than, uh, Orgat's armor?

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** I mean, I mean my armor with Orgat's.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** I'll just put the name tag on it.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** It's probably heavy armor, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:44]** No, Rick's going to turn back and he's going to say, he's going to be like hand signaling, but like bogey spotted.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** I believe it might be Orvier.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** Let's move in.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** I'm going to take this off.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** Do we know these hand signals?

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** Yep.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** He says, we know.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** We're going to throw a culture check for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:57]** Rick is pulling a full third base coach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:59]** What is happening?

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** You all are going to need to have a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:04]** He's like Whisper talking to you at the same time that he's pointing.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** So he's going to be like, I'm going to move south.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:07]** I guess you can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:08]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:15]** I'm going to move to the south side and keep a line of fire, but please come in behind me.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:16]** Be prepared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:18]** Peace, live long and prosper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:20]** Okay.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** Yeah.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:26]** Rick is going to roll stealth.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:28]** I think I'm going to try to roll stealth in this one.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** Roll stealth, babe.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:32]** It's stupid because I don't have very good stealth.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** I got to keep scrolling.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** It's going to happen.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** I have a plus eight.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:36]** That's not that bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** Do you have disadvantage such with your armor or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:42]** No, I think I'm down to medium armor.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:45]** Okay.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** What's 8 plus 16?

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** That's a lot.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** 24.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:56]** So with a 24, I step in and then I shut the door on accident.

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:01]** I feel like that's a failure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:04]** I got this.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** Did you delete the door?

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** Because I don't see the door anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:31]** did i just tried to move my doors open okay so you're so stealthy that there is a step in yeah and down to this corner the door is a portal to the drift and rick immediately dies take take a five foot step in and stop there oh because there's a wall okay so i'm gonna stop move to there no go go back and take a five foot step there we go


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** Oh, you're going to do something to me?

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:45]** As you walk in, you can see further the right pauldron in armor of, you think, yeah, this is probably Horvier.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:51]** They're sitting on the ground, leaning against the table, and they're not moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:54]** I know it's Orvir, just from, like, deduction.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** You see their hand, Wang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:57]** It was Orvir.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** No, I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** Yeah, it's a zombie.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:03]** Their back is to you, leaning against the table.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** Please don't.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:06]** Their legs are out.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** But they're unconscious.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:10]** Okay.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** Uh... Do you still walk up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:16]** I'm going to step forward.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:18]** That saves Southworld, or is it a new Southworld?

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:18]** Southworld.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:19]** Southworld.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** We'll keep it all the same.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** So you step in.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:24]** I'm going to ask Dr. Okay, what is everyone else doing?

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** Do you step in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:27]** I think Bernice is going to come into the room with Rick.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** Okay, Bernice goes in with Rick.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:34]** Slowly, with stealth, and start moving to the far corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:36]** Okay, what's your stealth role, Bernice?


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:57]** natural while you're rolling that colin here's i got a natural 20 dude for bernice i don't even know rick might not even hear you i don't know it's fine i think colin follows the briefcase in okay can you go comes up and stands at the door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:06]** Here's this kind of looks in the door and his eyes twinkle at the sight of armor on a passed out figure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:08]** His eyes bulge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** It's like the plants from book two.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** He gets really into it.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:21]** but he's going to wait on the outside and kind of like be on the other side of the door.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Uh, okay.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:24]** Out of view, you know what I'm saying?

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:28]** So at the wall adjacent to the door, hidden from view, from whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** Kaniko steps in.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** So she's not blocking.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** Colin got an 18 for his stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** The figure has not moved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** Yeah, because it hasn't heard anything.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** Look out in the outside.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** I'm close enough.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** Can I do a medicine check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:44]** Yeah, I was going to ask if Colin could move in and inspect the body.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:51]** Like, I would expect he would recognize a corpse based on his previous experience.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:56]** Rick taps his shoulder at Kevin's mom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:01]** Ouch!


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:01]** Oh, no!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:06]** And then Kevin comes out from the balcony with his friend.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** Yeah.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** But it's actually two Kevins.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:13]** There's just two of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:15]** You point at each other.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:19]** All right, so the body's not moving.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:22]** I can tell you that you can see the body's breathing.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** Oh, okay.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** I rolled an eight on medicine.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:28]** Yeah, they're breathing and they are not moving.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Do you walk around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:38]** I think Colin moves next to the body, still stealthily, and inspects.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:46]** He wants to do as much as he can without physically touching the body to see what is going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:55]** You walk up, and you are just taken at first with the beauty of this armor.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** It is Yomedai.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** What the f***?

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:06]** Oh, and there's like a symbol of Yomadai on it.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:10]** And it is just beautifully crafted, heavy armor.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:18]** You've definitely heard of like knockoffs of this armor, you know, but like, this is the real deal.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:22]** This is beautifully constructed with heavy plates that must feel light.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:26]** There's like clearly a hybrid magic that's holding everything together.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** There's a lot of synth weave in there.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** It's,

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:33]** There's even, you think, possibly some sort of force field.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:44]** You're just kind of getting this out from the flashing light as they'll show the sky of the Brutaris match and it lights up the room for a second.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:47]** And then it goes back because it shows a close-up of the player's foot.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:53]** You see Orvi or Pyke, unconscious, eyes closed.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:58]** One hand, the left hand that Rick 19 saw, is out laying on the ground.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:04]** The other hand is in their lap, just on their leg.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:14]** On the other side of them that you couldn't see on the other side of the table, there appears to be like a sponge.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:17]** And next to it is like a bowl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:20]** Does the sponge smell like chloroform to you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:47]** so uh that's what you see they appear to be unconscious maybe they were cleaning some dishes uh i think colin whispers in the calm to dr okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:55]** Doctor, I can see that Orvir is unconscious, but he appears to be fine.

**[00:29:55 - 00:30:01]** Otherwise, there are some sponges in here that may have some questionable substances.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:06]** Like surgical sponges or dishwashing sponges?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:09]** They look like they've been used to clean something.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:14]** I expect some dishes, maybe a weapon, I'm not sure.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:14]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:17]** Are there dishes, are there dirty and clean dishes?

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:21]** Like, is he, he's at the sink and the dishes look like they were being cleaned?


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:22]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:28]** Okay, so metagaming, but I think... Dang it, close the door.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** He was hit by the thing.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:36]** The same thing that happened to... I forget the captain's name, and was it... Gnarla and Shay.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** Gnarla and Shay.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:42]** They were hit by the beam that tried to overtake them, but they just passed out instead.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:45]** And so if he's knocked out, we should take off his armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** That's an idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** Is he okay?

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** He is alive, but he's unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** Okay.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:59]** I can only hear, but if someone's unconscious... How did the TV turn on then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** So Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:08]** is going to, I guess, examine the sponge using his chemilizer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:09]** Go over.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** Rick checks his watch.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** He just walks into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** This is too interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:17]** We all crowd around real tight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** There's not a lot of space.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:23]** Orvier takes up, like, the max.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:28]** Orvier is the maximum of medium before you get to, like, a large creature.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:30]** Orvier is huge.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** Yeah, he's a big guy.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** He's a big dude.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:51]** so he's thick the sponge the sponge okay you pick it up the three smells like uh it's a nice floral scent you think i think i've i've smelled this simple green castorville yeah it's like a little castor villain and lavender you know it's nice

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** You look up, you see the bottle of soap.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** It's castravelian lavender.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** You're like, okay.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** Does he have any weapons on him?

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:01]** He does have weapons on him.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:06]** He has a... What is that?

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:12]** He has just on him a arc pistol.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** Not like anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** Intense.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:21]** Can I do a medicine check to see if he's under the same knockout influence as Gnarla?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** I'll tell you.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:22]** Sure.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** I'll tell you without the check.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** He definitely seems like it.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:29]** You put your tentacle on and try and check him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** He is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** He is out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:38]** I think he's suffering the same effects as those Captain Narla on the bridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** Oh, and Shay.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:40]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** They are.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** This is Kaniko.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** They are unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:44]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:51]** Rick is going to reach down, and do I need to do a sleight of hand check to take the weapon off him without waking him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** I don't think he's going to wake up.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:56]** I mean, do you, without waking him?

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** He doesn't seem like he's going to wake up.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:04]** If you want to take the weapon without alerting Gnarla, then that would be a sleight of hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** What kind of armor does he have again?

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** No, I'm not trying to.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** Yeah, I was wondering that too.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** What kind of armor?

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** Yamira?

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** Yamada?

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:13]** Yamida?

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:13]** Yamada.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Yamada armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:34]** uh he has actually give me a culture check because this is like this is some good stuff 23 23 as well 23


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:34]** Pretty good.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** Yeah, this is Inheritor's Grace armor.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:41]** It's the armor of the Inheritor Ascendant.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:44]** Level 6 armor?

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:47]** Yeah, it's dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** It's heavy armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** We knew it all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** If I might make a recommendation, take the armor off and then shoot him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** I don't even know how to spell Inheritor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:02]** Well, I can just put a link in our Discord.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** Inheritor's Grace.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:05]** It's really good, apparently.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:08]** When first commissioned by the Church of Iomidae.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:10]** Iomidae.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** The armor of the Inheritor ascended.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:16]** Starfinder Armory, page 68.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** I need to stop cursing.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** By her grace, we are protected.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:26]** Not only the Taoists of Lomadai's church refer to her armor by its proper title.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:30]** Each suit of Inheritor's Grace armor constructed by the church receives blessings as part of its construction.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:35]** Though otherwise identical knockoffs and officially licensed suits also exist.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:40]** It's extremely common among worshippers of Lomadai and Knights of Galarian.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** Ooh, very cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:45]** But like the worshippers of Lomadai who are like...

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** The gauntlet of Yamada.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:52]** Like, it's the people who are going to go out there... When you buy Air Force Ones and then you buy the premium Air Force Ones.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:53]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** It's a little bit different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:56]** The Inheritor just hits a little different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:01]** This armor, like, has EAC plus 9, KAC plus 10.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:03]** It's, like, pretty good.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:06]** Obviously, speed adjustment is, like, negative, but...

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** But we can't wear it, at least not yet.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** I guess someone could carry it.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** I can't wear it.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Why can't you wear it?

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:15]** Well, it's level six.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:17]** You can wear it level six, because we're level four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:22]** Yeah, you can go up two levels, but I'm not classed for heavy armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:23]** All right.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:27]** I'm not sure I am either.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:30]** Rick is going to reach down and grab the art pistol, but he's not stealing it.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:33]** He is pulling the pistol out and sliding it away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:35]** To shoot him in the face.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:35]** Sure.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** And it's very clear that that's the way he's doing it.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** So he's going to pull the pistol out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** Can you wear heavy armor, Rick?

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:41]** Yes.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** Oh, you should wear this.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** You should take this, Rick.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** It's too heavy for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** He's not even listening to you.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** Rick is ignoring what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:52]** My sexy insect body will not.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Wait, why?

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** Why me specifically?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:58]** Is he a threat if he fell unconscious like Gnarla and Chek?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:02]** I am not certain if anybody is a threat at this point.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** I have to be cautious of everyone.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** And he slides the pistol away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** Oh, yeah, that's fine.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:12]** Sorry, I thought I heard Hears talking about taking the armor.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:12]** I wasn't sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:15]** I heard that as well, and I was choosing to ignore it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:20]** Okay, well, I think now we know where everybody is on board.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:26]** I'm thinking that we need to deal with this ship that's outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:28]** That feels like the logical next step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:34]** Should we man the bridge?

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** Ourselves, the five of us.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** We're going to try to get out of here.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:39]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:44]** What were you saying, Colin, about getting outside of the range?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** Bless you.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:55]** There's a mystic shadow cast over our drift engines, and that seems to be disabling everything.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:58]** That's why we haven't moved in the last 24 hours.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:58]** Hours.

**[00:36:59 - 00:36:59]** Hours.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** Hours.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Hours.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:14]** And based on my mystic ability, I would imagine if we can get out of that range or if we could disable the ship that's casting it, we could probably be on our way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:18]** And the entire crew has been immobilized.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** It is up to us to handle this.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:21]** I agree.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:28]** I have not experienced in any kind of ship-borne combat...

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:32]** But I think I might be able to man the guns.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** I'll head to the turret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** You're a pirate.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** Space pirate, right?

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** You called?

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:41]** Yeah, you can pilot, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:47]** I mean, I'm... So the thing is, I was not...

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:49]** I captained a ship and I can pilot.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** It's not the thing I'm most proficient at.

**[00:37:52 - 00:38:01]** More of what I did was leadership skills, espionage stuff to a degree with an old friend of mine, but my piloting is okay, but it may not be the best among us.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:28]** know well i had guys all the time i've got a bit of skill in it but that's just surprising to me well not every pirate is like gonna you know be steering the ship here's too high up there man he doesn't need to do that okay man all right gotta defend yours but at metagaming will what's your uh what's your pilot modification it's only plus five for me plus six i got plus four for piloting


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** I don't have a lot of experience piloting.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:39]** I do have a lot of experience with more softer skills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** I understand that.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** That's sort of where I come from too.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** Yeah.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:42]** Yeah.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** You know, it's not all about like, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:45]** It's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:46]** The glory, right?

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** You know, a good captain.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** You know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:55]** Now, I have a feeling I'm the second best pilot here is what I'm kind of getting, gauging from this conversation.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** So, yeah.

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:00]** I'll do it if I need to, but it seems, Doctor, you might know a little more than I do.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** Unless Colin has something to add.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** Nope.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:08]** I'm pretty terrible at piloting, but I could get by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** What's her name?

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** She was Shira.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:15]** Shira was a really good pilot, but she's not here, so alas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:23]** So we need to... It sounds like we need to get out from under this shadow.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** Colin, is that what you're saying?

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** Okay.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** I can help with engineering.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** Projector, if I don't recall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** Yes, I think you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Okay.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:36]** I'm a good computer and engineering specialist, so you put me to use in that way.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:37]** I recommend that.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** All right.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:44]** Okay, so we need to get out from under this.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:50]** We're going to have to figure out something at the bridge to try and...

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:50]** I don't know.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:52]** This is not my expertise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:39:53 - 00:40:03]** Well, before this all went down, Kaniko, we had convinced Captain Narla and Shay and the others that we were going to fight back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:04]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** All in one fell swoop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:07]** Okay.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:14]** And then the greys attacked us with this mind-altering effect that... Right.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:17]** Well, made everyone on the ship go AWOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** Yeah.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Yeah.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** This is what I suggest.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:27]** Normally, in these kinds of situations, I would staff people where they're best able to perform.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:28]** Okay.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:30]** So I know that you say you're good at soft skills.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** Are you a good gunner by chance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** A good gunner.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:38]** Well, I didn't get to be second in command of Xperitons by not being a good gunner.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** That's good.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** I think that could be good.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** How many gun bays do you have on this ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:50]** If I remember right, I believe there are four.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** Four.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** Excellent.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:56]** There's a turret, starboard, port, and...

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:59]** What's the, what's the, what's the one in front?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Oh, you mean like the front forward.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** Yeah.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:03]** Thank you.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:04]** Yeah.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:07]** I knew that too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** We know this stuff because this is what we do for a living.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:09]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:10]** Yeah.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** No, 100%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:15]** Well, I personally think that in my experience and you probably agree, you could be a gunner.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** I think Rick is very good at shooting and killing things.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** He could be a gunner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:19]** All right.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:25]** I know that Colin is quite good at, uh, he's, he's very mystically, uh, in tune and,

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:29]** He could make a good magic officer or an engineer knowing Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:32]** There is something about this gun here too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:36]** I like this plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:46]** I do recall in a briefing of this ship, I do recall one of the guns is actually a mystical gun.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** I think it's the turret gun.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:54]** Yeah, so it allows you to channel into your mysticism in order to help use it.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:56]** So that's an interesting thing to add in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** We have some choices.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:00]** That's really good.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:06]** I'll leave it up to the doctor to choose where he feels like he is kind of best placed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:08]** Well, I mean, I don't have much choice.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** We've got to fly this thing, right?

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:15]** But, I mean, typically I play a role as a science officer.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:21]** But since we're at this crossroads, perhaps I'll pilot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:24]** I mean, we can all switch around if we need to, right?

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:25]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** You can't do that.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:31]** The science council is not too far from the helm, I presume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:32]** Exactly.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:34]** And if I need to, I will jump in.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:40]** I don't have that much role, or that much expertise, but I'm happy to take on where I am needed.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** And she smiles.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:48]** You can tell she's starting to settle into this chief's mate kind of role, this secondary role.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:50]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** I like it.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:51]** All right.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** So, yeah.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** This is what she does.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:58]** Doc, I can trade off with you as pilot if you need to run somewhere else or something and do your stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** So, yeah.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:03]** Only if we need to rebalance shields or something.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:05]** Yeah, there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:05]** Just remind me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:12]** Are we just going to fire at them first, or are we going to try and break loose and fire?

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:15]** I'd say that we would try and break loose first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:16]** Is that right, Colin?

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:21]** Maybe we should get up to the bridge and have a look about ourselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** That's a good idea.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:23]** That's right.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:25]** We're all talking about this in the cafeteria.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:31]** As they say on Akitang, let's get out of Kefauk Depot first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** Yeah, no one wants to be there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:37]** I thought that they said that there's no flying in Kefauk Depot.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** That seems different than what I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** That's why everyone is trying to get out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:49]** As everyone leaves the cafeteria, Rick takes off the armor from Orbeez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:53]** How long does it take to doff


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:55]** to take off your armor and put on his armor?

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** I think it's a minute 30 to dawn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** Is heavy armor different?

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** So what do you say?

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** Yeah, it's the same.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** It's 16 rounds.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:06]** Stick around for a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** A minute's not going to kill us.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** You do it, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:12]** It's just over three minutes for him to take it off and don it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Sorry, where is Rick?

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** I forgot we had all this past hours.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:20]** I think he... I asked Rick to stay behind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:24]** But Rick puts a piece of tape over... Maybe head to the turret.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** It's fine.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** I did it telepathically.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:26]** I'm a Sheeran.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** Come on.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** Hi, my name is Orvier Sticker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** Rick and Orvier are best friends, by the way.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:36]** Did I tell you that?

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Like, they're really close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:44]** To be clear, you walk into the bridge wearing Orvier Pike's armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:49]** And I also bound Orvier with my bindings.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** But... Oh, Orvier's gonna be pissed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:52 - 00:45:01]** You can tell that when you walk on board and Kanika sees you, you can... She gets the most sour expression.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:05]** And she walks over to you and she says, Rick f***ing 19.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:09]** We're going to have words after this if we get out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:13]** And then she walks back to her station.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** I intend to survive.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** And he looks at her as she walks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** We'll all survive.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** You guys, like, cool this until later.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** All right?

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** We're a team now.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:26]** What are you wearing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:28]** What are you wearing?

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** You're still wearing the other guy's armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** You're wearing the other guy's armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:59]** he just turns around with a confident fucking smile you just see like warrior bears like name shine off the light like yeah say it do as i say not as i do right there's the first rule of being a former pirate of the free captains there's text that appears that says like kaniko disliked that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** And I am officially putting it in my notes.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** And we'll see what happens later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:09]** Is that, like, my permanent record?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:14]** My notes are your permanent record.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:16]** Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:16]** Sorry.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:20]** In the notes, you mentioned that Konigo, like, kind of found here is hot, remember?

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:23]** It was a couple episodes ago.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** There was that thing that became canon.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** That was a canon event.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** That was spesh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:57]** who you just walked in on no no no listen to two episodes listen to two episodes you'll know what I'm talking about oh no it was Kevin maybe that said it I don't know who no it was you John you said it you were like and then and then Koniko like fanned herself because she like was looking at here and he was hot I'm saying this just in case I need to influence something in the future it was Fetch no this isn't true that was Fetch no Fetch definitely was like no this is two episodes ago Fetch was gone a while ago and something tells me that stealing their crewmates armor would give them the ick

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:00]** I feel like maybe it balanced out.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** Maybe it's hot, but a douche.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** Alright, I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:09]** So what are you doing with the unconscious slash bound up?

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:14]** I think you bound everybody on the bridge, right?

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** Everybody on the ship is bound that is unconscious.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** And you put everybody in the corner.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:26]** Fetch, Sarzael, Ezra, and Shay, and Gnarla.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:31]** Okay, you pick them up, you put them over, you lean them against the ship.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:34]** Who is going to take what role right now?

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:37]** So you said the turret is the mystic weapon?

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:41]** The turret gun is the mystic gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:41]** Cool.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:45]** I think I should probably hop into that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:49]** So that is going to be a heavy laser net.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:53]** And it has the mystical property.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** That's cool.

**[00:47:54 - 00:48:05]** It's a hybrid device where it allows you to, when attempting a...

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:35]** a gunnery check you can use your ranks and mysticism in place of your base attack bonus or ranks and piloting and wisdom modifier in place of dex modifier to determine attack bonus maybe science officer that's like what i'm best at okay so for this is just for the starting round so colin is going to on the turret here's is going to science officer dr okay you are going to pilot for now yeah

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:35]** Cut.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** Rick, 19.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:39]** Gunner's position, but not the turret.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** Would you like the forward, aft, or port?

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:43]** I feel like I have options of all three.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:44]** Which one do you want?

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:50]** I wouldn't know until... I feel like I could jump between them, right?

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:52]** Yes, I'm just asking for the first round.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:53]** Where do you want to start?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** What I'm saying is I don't know until after the piloting phase.

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:04]** Don't we... Well... The turret is manned separately, and then the rest of the weapons are probably on a computer...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:04]** Right.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:08]** But at the beginning of every round, you're supposed to decide where you're going to go, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:12]** I pick a gunner's position, not a forward or aft or whatever gunner.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** I pick gunner.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** I am the gunner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** Yeah, is it the same?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:19]** I then choose my weapon at the time of the attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:20]** Oh, I didn't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:21]** Really?

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** I forgot or something.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:27]** Yeah, no, I thought that you choose the weapon that you're on, like the gun that you're on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:29]** But I could also be wrong.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:37]** No, I think your gunner is kind of the position, and then you choose your weapons as... I think the turret, in this situation, the turret is a whole separate location.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:47]** So just for story bases, if somebody is manning the turret, they would have to actually go into the elevator and get back to an abnormal position on the bridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:53]** I mean, we can say that that's done quickly enough during the round, that if you wanted to go there, you can do that, and that's not a problem.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:59]** I'm pretty sure the gunner is just the A position.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:09]** And then manning the guns has, like, the difference between the guns, obviously, is, like, they could have different firing arcs.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:12]** They could have different health or, like, be on the fritz if they get hit.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:13]** That sort of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:14]** Okay, cool.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** So you're going to be in a gunner position.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:19]** And Colin is a gunner, technically on the turret.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:21]** We'll call it for now, but gunner.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** Okay.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:28]** I am going to say that... Can we do a scan real quick?

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:31]** So, I like where your head's at.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** We're getting there.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** So... I'll do that.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** I'll do that.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:44]** I am going to let you all, I will put in here, I will let you all control Kaniko and decide where Kaniko goes.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:49]** I don't want to be like, it feels like too much to be playing against y'all, but playing with y'all with Kaniko.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:55]** So I'm happy to role play Kaniko, but I'm going to let you guys decide what Kaniko wants to do.

**[00:50:55 - 00:51:01]** So I'm going to share her skills right now in Discord.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:03]** Give me one sec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:32]** now you can let me know what you want her to do or if you want her to slide between things but i will let you all decide does she have like any science or physical science or anything like that i i put her skills in there she does that's all that's it that's it well it sounds like she would just be a gunner then because none of this is really useful uh either a gunner or a uh a morale officer yeah yeah she's good diplomacy so could be good i guess if that applies

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:42]** okay but like having two guns is useful like sure we have two guns so we have the mystic yeah yeah but but you can fire two guns on the same round is what i'm saying


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:47]** Well, yeah, but the only other gun, so the turret can fire any direction, right?

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:48]** The net?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** Yes.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** The turret can fire any direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:55]** And then the other gunnery position can only fire within one arc, right?

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:55]** Correct.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** Correct.

**[00:51:56 - 00:52:07]** So there's no sense in having, unless, I mean, I don't think you could possibly have somebody be in both firing arcs, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:07]** Right.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** Yeah, maybe.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:11]** And the range on this turret is pretty short.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** So, yeah.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** So let me do this.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:18]** Now that we've decided, I'm going to move you guys over to the new page.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:23]** Give me one second.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** I don't know how I feel about this.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:25]** Why?

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** All right.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** No, no, it's okay.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** It's all right.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** I know what it's going to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:41]** While John gets this styled up, I do want to take a moment to thank Finder of the Past and Stars for popping our starship combat cherry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:46]** Is that an offensive term in the best of ways?

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** Is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** Oh, I'm so sorry.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** I didn't realize that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** He was really aggressive about it, too.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** So the way in which he popped it was very.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** Indeed.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** But I love it, though.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:54]** Thank you, Finder.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** Thank you very much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** You're an awesome dude.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** We really appreciate you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:00]** Absolutely instrumental in all of our understanding of Starship Company.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:00]** Yeah, Finder.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:01]** You're great, man.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** The best friends.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:04]** Always enjoy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:04]** We do.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:04]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:04]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:23]** and if you'd like to join them join our discord discord yeah uh you can get it on the twitter what's the ad again we'll save podcast or you just go to discord.willsavepodcast.com oh there you go yeah we have that now settled it discord.willsavepodcast.com let's show you over to a new map


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:25]** Boom.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Activated.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:32]** You are looking at a map of a hex map for Starship.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:35]** Who knows what's going to happen?

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** I like the background.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:38]** Okay.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** Rick19, you don't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** It's 91%, 95%, 97%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** It's loading.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** So there's a moving background because Foundry is great.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:53]** And it is y'all and the Void Crier in the middle of the map.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** Now, I will tell you a couple things.

**[00:53:55 - 00:54:00]** We can cut this or we can keep this in, but there are a couple things that I want to note for everybody as we are here.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** And that is...

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:09]** This is just some starship combat kind of behind the scenes, like, to help you guys, controls and stuff like that.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:09]** First things first.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:14]** Do you see this green orb in the top of the map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** Yes, I do.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:15]** Yes.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** Okay.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** Rick19, has it just not loaded for you?

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** Do I need to shift load for this?

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:22]** Shift reload.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:24]** Yeah.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** Maybe you do.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** Okay.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** I am going to click on that.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:30]** And you all should now see a ring around here.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:34]** The forward arc is purple.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** The starboard arc is green.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** The aft arc is blue.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** Yellow arc is port.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** That's cool.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:45]** I'm just the gunner, so it doesn't matter if I see it or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** No, no, no.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:46]** You should see it.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:50]** Everybody should be able to click to turn that on and off if they would like.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:54]** So I will... Does it turn it off and on for everyone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** Yeah, it does.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:57]** I believe so.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:59]** It just clicks once and it turns on or off.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** Yeah, just leave it on.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** That's not how it works, actually.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:01]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:04]** Oh, that looks really cool, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:04]** Thanks.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** It's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** It's flashy.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** It's gorgeous, man.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:15]** So if the forward arc has a longer range than the aft arc, would they be different lengths?

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** Or is it just kind of a sphere?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:20]** I think it's just a general idea of which way the ship is facing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:23]** Yes, they do go out to 10 hexes.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:29]** The turret, now just to note, the void crier, I'm going to get to this now.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:36]** Actually, before we get there, let me show you, let me get to something else and I'm going to change the music so we can just kind of keep this energy up.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:43]** Whoever is going to be the piloting, whoever jumps into pilot at all, there is, please don't touch the Void Crier.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:44]** I'm going to unpause.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** You guys don't touch it.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** I will show you what's up.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:53]** If you click on the Void Crier and then, right, and you hold command.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:53]** Right?

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:59]** So if I grab and move, do you all see it moving and see some green hexes?

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** Yeah.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:00]** Great.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:09]** So again, because Starship Combat is you move and then based on the maneuverability, you have to move a certain amount before you can turn one side of your hex.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** For the Void Crier, it's going to be good.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:14]** So I think you have to move one square and then you can turn.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:17]** If you move and then press Command...

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** And hold command.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:21]** And then... Oh, shoot.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** What was that?

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:22]** No, no, no.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:24]** If you hold command and then click... Yes.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:27]** If you hold command...

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** And then click on yours.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:31]** Do you see this path that I'm making?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:31]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:32]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:37]** So if you just hold command and keep clicking, it will go through and do that whole thing.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:45]** And then there is another way, and I believe it is on the drag.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:49]** Oh, there was another way to do this, and I'm so sorry.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** And maybe we will figure it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:53]** Is there like a particular plug-in that we can...

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:56]** Shout out, and also I can look at the documentation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** This is the drag ruler.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:02]** There is another way to do it where it will move the path that you click through.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** And I forget what that is.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** Did I put it to shift?

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:07]** I think I did.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:08]** Yep.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:15]** If you click and hold and then move and press shift, every time you press shift, it will make this trajectory.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:18]** And do you see how it's adding up to 10 hexes or wherever you want it to be?

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:22]** And then as soon as you let go, it will move along that path.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** Sorry, say that one more time.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:27]** So, I'm going to move the ship back to where it was.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** You all see it moving, right?

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:31]** If I click on it...

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:34]** And then I move it forward as if I'm dragging to see what's happening, right?

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:42]** As soon as I get to a hex that I want to change the path, if I press shift, it will make these waypoints.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:43]** Do y'all see that?

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:44]** Yes.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:44]** Yeah.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:48]** So you have to hold command and press shift every way.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** But it didn't rotate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:49]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** Right.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** That's the next step.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** Good thinking.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:56]** If you hold R...

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** there will be an arrow.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** Do you see this?

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:00]** That's awesome.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** And you can rotate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:04]** Are you rotating it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:04]** I am.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** Is somebody else rotating it?

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** Please don't.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:13]** So if you click and hold R, it will move and rotate in whatever way you want it to do in which you point the arrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:14]** Gotcha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:16]** It might be moving slow because there's just network stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:16]** Right.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:19]** So hold R and then click the direction you want it to face.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** Don't click.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:22]** Just move your cursor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:22]** Okay.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:29]** So if I want to make a U-turn and I have to move one turn, then I know that I could go, right?

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** I could click on it.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:30]** Sorry.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** I could click as if I'm going to move.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:36]** And then I go shift, shift, shift, shift.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:38]** And boom, it will move me along that path.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:42]** And then I hold R and I just point it the other way because I wanted to face the other way.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:44]** And boom, I've now moved the ship.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:44]** Question.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:52]** Can you move, shift, R, move, shift, R without letting go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** I don't know that you can do that.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:54]** I don't think so.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** Why did you move it back?

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** Oh, sorry, because I didn't know why you moved it.

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:02]** Anyway, I'll put it back to its starting position whenever you guys are done.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:10]** I just want to kind of give you a quick little primer on just making movement a little bit easier to measure out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:12]** Awesome.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:12]** Cool.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:14]** I love the color indicators.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** It's my favorite thing.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:15]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** So what is forward?

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:17]** Pink is forward?

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:18]** Blue is aft?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** Yeah, the purple is forward.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:21]** Blue is aft.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:25]** So, that's one thing.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:29]** I'm going to put it back to, where was it?

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:30]** Okay, so it's back there.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** I'll leave it there for right now.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:37]** I'm also going to now, in your journals, I'm going to show you two things.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:45]** First, I'm going to show the DC, the Starship DC table, which Finder sent to me.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:46]** So, you guys should be familiar with this.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:48]** Super handy and helpful.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** Thanks, Finder.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** Yep, it's really great.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** What tier is our ship?

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** Let me show you.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** This is the Void Cryer.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:55]** Oh, this thing.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** Yeah, this thing is convenient.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** Hand out.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** Give me one second.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** Make sure I'm on something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:09]** Thank you, Finder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:10]** Enter.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:12]** Okay, good.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** Okay, I'm going to show you guys this handout, too.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** And there you go.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** It's a PDF.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:16]** You can load it.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:18]** You can pop it out.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** It's the Void Crier handout.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:21]** Also... Ooh.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:32]** I am going to, if you all double click on the Void Crier token, you should see the sheet come up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:33]** Oh, this is cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:36]** So your PCU is correct.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:38]** Your shields are correct.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** Your critical damage is all there.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:44]** On weapons, you'll see that your forward arc is a heavy laser cannon.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:47]** You'll see that your starboard and port arcs are light particle beams.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:51]** And you'll see that your turret is a heavy laser net on that tab.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:57]** You can click on features to see more things in case you need to get some details on like sensors or armor or whatever.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:59]** In the crew, let me do this.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** You're not there and you're not there.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:05]** In the crew, I'm going to drag you guys to where you were.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:10]** So we were saying that Colin was a gunner.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:15]** So I'm going to put you under gunner and you should see yourself under gunner.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:17]** Rick19 was a gunner.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** Nope.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:20]** You're going to be under gunner.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:23]** And Dr. Okay is the pilot.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:26]** And Kaniko is what, the captain?

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** For morale, is that right?

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:30]** Yep.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]** Okay.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:33]** Kaniko Breeze is under captain.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:37]** And then here's is, you said science officer, right?

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** Yes.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:46]** So what this should do, because I've now put all of your characters, for the most part, there's some things that I left out, I put you all in Foundry.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:49]** So your skills are mostly there.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** I did a double check.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:53]** They might be one off because there's a difference between Hero Lab and Foundry.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:54]** It doesn't matter.

**[01:01:54 - 01:02:03]** If you click on your token, you'll see that your hit points, your stamina points, your RP, that you are now in Foundry.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:29]** so that means that your bonuses should should carry over and if you are a gunner and you click on attack you should be able to theoretically roll an attack by just clicking under the weapons tab click on the tab and you'll see that it should give you a bonus there and then you can click on damage and roll damage so that's how you can roll all of your stuff and you can click on that

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:32]** It should be good with your bonuses.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:33]** Awesome.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** So good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:35]** The action section.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:36]** Yeah.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:39]** So, well, there's, well, there's, oh yeah, thank you.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** There's also actions.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:46]** If you, so if you hover over any of the actions in the tab, it will give you a description of what that action is.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:49]** If you click on it, it will give you a dropdown of what that action is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** You can also roll from here too.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:51]** It's kind of cool.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:52]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:53]** Yeah.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:54]** No, no, no, no.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:56]** And it's open crew.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:57]** It's chief mate.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** It's science officer.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:59]** It's engineer.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:01]** It's magic officer.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:02]** It has all the actions here.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:08]** So you have several ways that you can decide on what action you want to do if you're trying to look it up, if you're trying to roll for it.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:08]** You have the sheet.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:09]** You can roll offline.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:10]** You also have this.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:11]** You can roll online.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:18]** I would encourage you to maybe keep track of things like shields, critical damage, hull points.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:21]** Keep track of that here on Foundry just so it's easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:24]** For weapons, it says plus seven attack.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:25]** Is that just an arbitrary number?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:32]** No, it should be calculated based on whoever is the gunner, which is Colin and Rick.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:36]** It should be calculating your dex plus all this other stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:42]** Okay, because I think it's BAB plus dex, and mine should be plus eight if I were to calculate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:45]** So when you do yours, if you want to do plus eight and add one to it, that's fine too.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:50]** I'll have to check and see about what happens when you have multiple people in the same role.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]** Yeah.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:55]** Actually, do you want to just take Colin off real quick and see if it changes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** Sure.

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** Took him off.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:58]** It's plus nine.

**[01:03:59 - 01:03:59]** It went to plus nine.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:06]** So it's using my... Yeah, I thought it was... Also, keep in mind, Colin, when you're firing the turret, you can use your mysticism roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:09]** So you might not want to do that.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** That's what I was looking at.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:12]** It's actually a bit more nuanced than that.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:14]** It's...

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:21]** I use my ranks in mysticism instead of the base attack bonus.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:25]** So it's effectively a plus two.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:27]** John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:27]** Yeah, Kelly?

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:32]** In the roll, it says that it calculates your skills through some mod.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:37]** So it's already factored in if you're using the action section to roll.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:39]** So you don't need to worry about managing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:40]** That was my plan.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:42]** So that way you can make it easy for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:44]** I appreciate that very much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:44]** Yeah.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** That's very nice.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:46]** I want to make it easy.

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:48]** Cool.

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:53]** That is all that I have for setting the table for Starship Combat.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:59]** Just wanted to make it a little bit easier so you all weren't flipping back and forth and click on stuff and firing arcs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:04]** This is a very thoughtful thing to do because we otherwise would be very bad at it, I feel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:06]** No, I think y'all are going to be awesome.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** Eventually.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:12]** Kev, you had your finger crooked like you were trying to say something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:13]** No, I'm just thinking.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:17]** And I was checking the USC football scores.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:28]** All right, so we are here at the beginning of some sort of, I don't know if I want to call it combat because I don't know what's going to happen, but it's something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:29]** Yeah, totally not going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:31]** Yeah, I don't think combat will happen.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:35]** No, I mean, I'm just saying, like, maybe you all are like, f*** this, I'm out.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:36]** Who knows?

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:37]** Will!

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:43]** Dr. Okay, you mentioned before, you were like, hey, should we do a little scan scan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:45]** We'll scan, scan.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:46]** That would be my job.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:47]** Can I scan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:49]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:49]** If you want to scan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:50]** I will say this.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:53]** That is your friendly hears, but he's intense, too.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:54]** I beg your pardon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:57]** You all will get one computer's check right now.

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:57]** Really?

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:58]** To scan.

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:02]** And then Starship Combat will begin regardless of the output.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:04]** become of that scan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:04]** Whoa.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:07]** It's an odd thing to say, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:12]** I get a free scan, but is it as powerful as the officer's scan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:13]** Can I ask a question?

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:16]** Is this a single character getting to scan or can multiple characters scan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:19]** No, I mean, this is a scan.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:42]** because like is it are you guys also scry right because scrying is effectively scary also question are you guys trying to do some sort of engineering thing like because i believe we talked about before narla was like i think we can boost something from the general engines to try and move out of the shadows so we can move or were you going to shoot like maybe i should start there

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:43]** Rewind a little bit.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:45]** What is your plan here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:51]** Well, I think plan A is to figure out where the ship that has immobilized us is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:52]** Okay.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:56]** Which we determined was pretty, I thought from the last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:56 - 01:07:00]** It was in the aft 50%, but that was as far as we got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:02]** What's the green orb?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:09]** The green orb is the toggle for the sphere of the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:10]** So it's not a physical thing.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:12]** No, it's just a control on the gamepad.

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:14]** It's a HUD for the foundry.

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:28]** So I think what Colin would like to do is use the magic officer ability scrying to use his mysticism ability as a scan.

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:42]** So he takes the he grabs like a cup full of pencils as captains keep nearby and he casts it on the ground.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:52]** And then based they they sort of actually I'm going to roll and we'll see how close to an arrow they appear to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:56]** No other analog item on the bridge, by the way.

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:59]** There's no paper, but there is a cup of pencils.

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:00]** It's good luck.

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:00]** Here we go.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:02]** Everyone knows.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:02]** It's good luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:03]** So, fun fact.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:14]** The United States and several other NATO countries were working on building a device that could write in vacuum, upside down, blah, blah, blah.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:17]** In the meantime, the Russians just use a pencil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:17]** Yeah.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:19]** And the reason why...

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:20]** The Americans didn't.

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:23]** It was because they didn't want graphite shavings floating around in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** Yeah, about that.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:26]** Anyways.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:27]** America!

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:31]** On a submarine, we use grease pencils that can write on almost anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** Grease pencils are dope.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:35]** We use those in mechanics, like working on engines.

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:41]** And also on flooring, too, because it doesn't wash off when you're cutting with a wet saw.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:43]** But it still wipes off in the end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:46]** That's a 28 mysticism check.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:47]** A 28.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:50]** I'm pretty sure that succeeds.

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:53]** That does succeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:57]** You succeeded.

**[01:08:57 - 01:09:01]** You just succeeded.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:02]** You just succeeded.

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:05]** So I am going to tell you.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:14]** that the ship appears to be about eight hexes behind you in the aft arc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:15]** Directly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:17]** It seems to be directly behind you.

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:18]** Well, that's something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:20]** That's pretty close.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:23]** All of ours, we roll as one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:47]** here's we'll scan the traditional one screw one crew uh rolling hilarious wait what is here's rolling because you've you've scanned to see where they are yeah yeah but there's but the normal science scan doesn't even deal with location it's like other well i guess it does but you can find out other stuff we're not in combat yet


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:09:47 - 01:10:08]** this is he's giving us a pre-round my mistake but i thought pre-round pre-round eight hexes behind you now what do you want to do with that information so we get a free round okay um should we uh blow this popsicle stand and try to get out of range for a moment what's our range on our weapons again rick what's the range


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:13]** As soon as you guys announce that, I don't know what the range is on these things.

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:17]** Well, can I run a computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:18]** On the handout.

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:20]** Yeah, I'm looking at the handout.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:24]** Can someone check the schematics, please?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:32]** If this manual is to be believed, this turret I'm on has about five hexes, and the rest of the guns are about ten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:32 - 01:11:00]** all right so wait i well no i'm just confused because it says it says starship weapon direct fire heavy medium mounted and then the next one's light medium mounted so i'm assuming one is range and one is the type of weapon what what do you look heavy laser net heavy laser i clicked on particle beam light particle beam that's just the type right so the heavy laser cannon is the forward mounted weapon the light particle beams are the starboard import mounted weapons right

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:01]** But it says heavy and medium.

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:06]** If you click on it, it drops down a menu and underneath it has like... Medium is the range.

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:08]** Medium is the range.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:10]** And medium range is, I forget.

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:10]** 10.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:11]** Okay.

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:16]** So then that makes sense because the laser is a heavy weapon, but it's short range.

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:18]** But the heavy laser is 10.

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:18]** Yeah.

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:21]** The heavy laser net is five.

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:23]** It's short range.

**[01:11:23 - 01:11:25]** The heavy laser cannon is medium.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:28]** The heavy laser net is a heavy weapon, but it's a short.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:33]** Am I reading this correctly that it's 15D6 for the heavy laser net?

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:34]** No.

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:35]** No, 5D6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:36]** No.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:38]** 5D6.

**[01:11:38 - 01:12:07]** yeah right so it's a heavy weapon but it's a short range so it's only five yeah it's an open parentheses but the font is styled in a way that makes it look like one that is me trying to match the font because uh spoiler this is not the void crier that's given in the book so it's a little different so that's me trying to okay so all of the other weapons are 10 hexes correct and as as you guys announced that the um the gray ship is about eight hexes in our aft


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:07 - 01:12:15]** Rick is at the weapons console, and he is looking at everything, and he says, just to inform you, we do not have any weapons in the aft quadrant.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:17]** We will need to turn in order to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:19]** Do we turn and burn?

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:19]** I see.

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:23]** I am not sure what that means, but it sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:25]** The flippin' burn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:31]** I can really try, but it's a pretty high DC.

**[01:12:31 - 01:12:32]** It's a 22.

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:34]** Yeah.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:38]** I mean, I can also just pilot us to get us facing forward.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:40]** That could be fine.

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:41]** Whatever works best for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:44]** Kaniko, is there any way you can help us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:44]** Sure.

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:45]** Yeah, of course.

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:46]** What do you want me to help with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:51]** Can we make this turn and burn maneuver?

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:52]** Flip and burn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:55]** Yeah.

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:59]** As captain, I guess, which action would you like me to take as morale officer?

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:00]** That's what I'm trying to find out.

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:04]** You should probably take an encourage.

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:05]** Okay.

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:10]** So DC 10, and then you provide a plus two to whatever check you were applying to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:13]** So it'd be a plus two to Dr. Okay's piloting check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:17]** If you roll a natural 20, it increases to plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:17]** Oh, wow.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:18]** Okay.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:18]** That's great.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:21]** And it's a DC 15 diplomacy check.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:25]** You can't encourage yourself, which is horrible for self-talk.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:27]** That's all right.

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:28]** Okay.

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:28]** Sorry.

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:30]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:38]** I want you to just picture the best possible outcome here.

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:39]** Hang on.

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:41]** Sorry, Colin.

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:42]** I was trying to encourage Dr. O.K.

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:44]** You're really putting a damper on this right now.

**[01:13:44 - 01:13:45]** Okay, never mind.

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:13:47 - 01:13:47]** All right, Colin.

**[01:13:47 - 01:13:47]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:49]** What were you going to say?

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:52]** Well, like, flip and burn is kind of the opposite of what we want.

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:54]** And the name is a terrible misnomer.

**[01:13:55 - 01:13:55]** We want to face them.

**[01:13:55 - 01:13:56]** Right.

**[01:13:56 - 01:14:00]** But, like, I imagine we want to face them and then head in that direction.

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:07]** But this is really a burn and then flip as described.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:10]** You move the ship up to half your speed and then rotate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:18]** You move up to its full speed and rotate 180 degrees to face the aft edge at the end of the movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:18]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:19]** It's not a flip and burn.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:20]** It's a burn and flip.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:22]** Well, that's dumb.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:23]** It is dumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:52]** i can turn in place i was gonna say i feel like you could just like do literally anything else and it would be more useful okay i mean i could yeah i can i can just turn around like piloting wise like we have 10 hex movement what is the movement yeah yeah you have 10 hexes of turn speed of one okay yeah so you have to move one hex to be able to turn one to one degree okay so you're gonna start moving forward yeah

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:54]** Okay.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:56]** Dr. K, I want you to picture the best possible outcome.

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:59]** See yourself nailing the engines.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:02]** See yourself... Nailing the engines.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:05]** Nailing the boost.

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:09]** See the power moving through into the engines.

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:12]** And you are able to make this flawlessly.

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:14]** That's what's going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:17]** As I struggle with Foundry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:15:18 - 01:15:23]** I automatically succeeded, because I have a plus 15 to diplomacy.

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:26]** So I rolled to see if I got a natural 20, and I didn't.

**[01:15:26 - 01:15:27]** So you have a plus 2 to your roll.

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:30]** For my initial piloting check?

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:34]** Because you're going to turn in place, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:34]** No.

**[01:15:35 - 01:15:36]** Your roll is going to turn around.

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:36]** No.

**[01:15:38 - 01:15:46]** I'm going to pilot the ship forward and move it, but for whatever reason, all of my previous...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:47 - 01:15:47]** Are we entering combat?

**[01:15:47 - 01:15:57]** Because you would roll pirating together, and whoever has the higher... I am giving you, as soon as you start moving...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:15:58 - 01:16:05]** You will enter combat or whatever action you take, but I'm giving you this round in order to figure out what you want to do.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:06]** So what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:07 - 01:16:08]** Wait, wait.

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:17]** If combat doesn't initiate until we move, then I suggest we... Oh, we can't because it's only five hexes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:19]** It's not move.

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:20]** It's just what are you going to do?

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:23]** You have a round to do something.

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:24]** I don't know what you're going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:29]** I was going to say, like, I was suggesting, like, maybe we should set up a turret, but the turret's not in range, so it doesn't matter.

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:30]** And also, yeah.

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:31]** Conveniently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:39]** When you look back there with your eyes, you don't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:39 - 01:17:01]** kelly i ask questions please all right cool so i i'd love to do something called improved counter measures because we kind of know where we're going to be and it would be nice to uh get ahead on basically as you might know uh it foils enemy targeting and project cannot do improve which requires a skill rating of 12 and you definitely do not have a skill cool cool so yeah so if you don't have 12 ranks in computers


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:05]** If you look at the cheat sheet, it shows the random symbol, it doesn't matter.

**[01:17:05 - 01:17:09]** The next column over is skill rating, and so that's the number you need.

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:13]** And then the next rating is cost, so it's one RP, so one resolve point.

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:16]** And then after that is push, there's a check mark.

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:20]** If it's a push, it means that if the weapon, or if the...

**[01:17:20 - 01:17:25]** The system you're trying to use is in a critical condition and damaged.

**[01:17:25 - 01:17:26]** You cannot use that.

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:35]** So if the computer systems are affected by a critical damage, then you can't use target system or lock on.

**[01:17:36 - 01:17:37]** Does that make sense?

**[01:17:38 - 01:17:38]** Well, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:38 - 01:17:39]** Yeah, I got you.

**[01:17:40 - 01:17:42]** So right now you can only use up to target system.

**[01:17:42 - 01:17:43]** Got it.

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:47]** So all of these have a pretty low chance of succeeding.

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:50]** The only really useful thing is balance and scan.

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:53]** I can't balance right now because I don't know what the f*** to do, I guess.

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:55]** Although in this shield point specifically.

**[01:17:55 - 01:17:58]** Because they could just move and then hit somewhere else, right?

**[01:17:58 - 01:17:59]** We don't really know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:59 - 01:18:05]** There's also the open options up on the first page, the bottom left.

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:05]** Okay.

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:13]** which gives you an extra attack point with ready weapon system, or you can do prioritize calculations.

**[01:18:13 - 01:18:15]** Like look at that list of, of open items that way.

**[01:18:15 - 01:18:18]** If you feel like you don't have anything else to do, you could always do those things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:28]** Well, and based on what we learned last time, I think figuring out learning what we don't know is incredibly valuable in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:18:29 - 01:18:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:30 - 01:18:31]** Hmm.

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:31]** Starship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:35]** What do you want to do with your turn right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:18:36 - 01:18:39]** Uh, I want to move in a C. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:18:39 - 01:18:41]** You, you want to turn around and move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:18:42 - 01:18:42]** Okay.

**[01:18:42 - 01:18:52]** I want to, I want to move in a 10, like, I want to do a flip and burn and not move because this is up to your half your speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:54]** So you could do a flip and burn in place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:18:54 - 01:18:54]** Yeah.

**[01:18:54 - 01:18:55]** And then I can't move.

**[01:18:55 - 01:18:56]** Right.

**[01:18:56 - 01:19:01]** Um, but I want to turn around and get us within five hexes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:19:03 - 01:19:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:19:03 - 01:19:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:19:03 - 01:19:09]** I think that or that or turn in place and then can I move after I turn in place?

**[01:19:09 - 01:19:09]** No.

**[01:19:09 - 01:19:10]** No movement, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:19:11 - 01:19:12]** That's your whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:19:13 - 01:19:14]** Yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:19:14 - 01:19:15]** Yeah.

**[01:19:15 - 01:19:15]** It's your whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:15 - 01:19:15]** Okay.

**[01:19:15 - 01:19:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:16]** Okay.

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:17]** I know what I'm going to do now.

**[01:19:17 - 01:19:18]** So I'm going to try to do it.

**[01:19:18 - 01:19:19]** When the time comes.

**[01:19:20 - 01:19:20]** You're right.

**[01:19:20 - 01:19:27]** If you were to do the C and then cut back, you could go basically five squares backwards and turn around.

**[01:19:28 - 01:19:29]** It's essentially the same movement.

**[01:19:30 - 01:19:31]** And that would put us within five hexes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:19:32 - 01:19:32]** Yeah.

**[01:19:32 - 01:19:36]** Can you just move the blood cryer to where you want it to be for now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:19:36 - 01:19:42]** So we've determined where the other ship is right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:42 - 01:19:45]** The other ship would be about here.

**[01:19:45 - 01:19:49]** Yeah, I mean, like, it's hard for me to... Eight hexes back, and you can get up to five hexes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:19:50 - 01:19:55]** Yeah, it's really hard without knowing my full movement, unless I just do it inch by inch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:19:56 - 01:19:57]** Yeah, just do it inch by inch.

**[01:19:58 - 01:19:58]** Okay.

**[01:19:58 - 01:19:59]** Just so we know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:20:00 - 01:20:02]** So somebody keep their cursor where it is?

**[01:20:03 - 01:20:03]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[01:20:03 - 01:20:06]** No, I mean, like, I don't know where they are, so you have to keep their cursor.

**[01:20:06 - 01:20:07]** I'll put something there.

**[01:20:08 - 01:20:09]** I'll put something there.

**[01:20:09 - 01:20:11]** So one can rotate...

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:12]** To there.

**[01:20:13 - 01:20:13]** Two.

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:17]** Can rotate to there.

**[01:20:18 - 01:20:18]** Three.

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:21]** Can rotate to there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:23]** Where is it?

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:25]** The enemy ship is on my cursor.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:28]** Okay.

**[01:20:29 - 01:20:29]** Four.

**[01:20:30 - 01:20:31]** John, I don't like that noise.

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:31]** Am I wrong?

**[01:20:32 - 01:20:33]** Five.

**[01:20:33 - 01:20:34]** Let me say that differently.

**[01:20:35 - 01:20:38]** My cursor is eight hexes directly aft from where we started.

**[01:20:38 - 01:20:39]** Seven.

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:40]** Eight.


## Speaker_0

**[01:20:40 - 01:20:40]** Nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:43]** Nine.

**[01:20:44 - 01:20:44]** Ten.

**[01:20:44 - 01:20:46]** Should still be in the forward firing arc, right?

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:47]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:20:48 - 01:20:48]** Okay.

**[01:20:50 - 01:20:52]** So.

**[01:20:52 - 01:20:52]** You all.

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:58]** So that's where you want your ship to be at as you start powering forward.

**[01:20:59 - 01:21:01]** So what does this look like?

**[01:21:01 - 01:21:04]** This was just us with the game so I could see where you were at.

**[01:21:05 - 01:21:06]** But walk me through what you say.

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:08]** How is this going to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_14

**[01:21:08 - 01:21:12]** Coming around to try and stuff them with some.

**[01:21:42 - 01:21:43]** Let's give them all we got, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:43 - 01:21:46]** Rick, before you fire, I have to help you out with something.

**[01:21:46 - 01:21:47]** Here's like rush.

**[01:21:47 - 01:21:47]** Super charge.

**[01:21:48 - 01:21:54]** Now, Rick, as he's like talking, as he's like fiddling with the controls, he's like, I'm going to ready your weapon system.

**[01:21:55 - 01:22:03]** And what this will do is that if you fire, you'll get plus one damage or plus two damage to starships above tier five.

**[01:22:04 - 01:22:05]** I don't know what tier we're talking about.

**[01:22:05 - 01:22:06]** It's a gray ship.

**[01:22:06 - 01:22:08]** It could be really high, too.

**[01:22:08 - 01:22:08]** All right.

**[01:22:08 - 01:22:09]** Just letting you know.

**[01:22:10 - 01:22:10]** You got this.

**[01:22:11 - 01:22:11]** Okay.

**[01:22:11 - 01:22:12]** He's going to actually stick here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:22:13 - 01:22:14]** All he's doing is rubbing Rick's shoulders.

**[01:22:14 - 01:22:15]** Yeah.

**[01:22:15 - 01:22:16]** He's going to be doing that.

**[01:22:16 - 01:22:16]** All right.

**[01:22:16 - 01:22:17]** This gives me a plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:22:19 - 01:22:19]** Yeah.
