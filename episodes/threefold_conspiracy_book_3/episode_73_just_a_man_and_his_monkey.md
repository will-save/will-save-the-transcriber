**[00:00:01 - 00:00:03]** Previously, on Will Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:18]** Colin cunningly coerces the consciousnesses of Rick, Dr. Okay, and here is conjuring a captivating concern, glimpses of greys guiding grim and grotesque experiments on the guinea pig gang aboard the Void Crier.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:31]** Shay is swayed to submit to hypnotic suggestion, but not before sharing some staggering sensor secrets, the void crier has been hit with an EMP and is now hovering helplessly halted for the last 24 hours.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:41]** Soon after sharing his subdued stories of the sinister schemes afoot, Shay is swayed into helping Dr. OK deduce a detail has been digging at the doctor.

**[00:00:41 - 00:00:51]** Their denial of drift drive is no doubt a distinction of a drift shadow projection device, diminishing the Void Crier's dynamics and must definitely be within a distance of them.

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:59]** Will they intrepidly interrupt the intricate intrigues instigated by these inscrutable alien invaders?

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:07]** Or will they idle indefinitely in interstellar imprisonment, imminently inching towards irreversible imperilment?

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:12]** Find out this time on Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:57]** You have come to the right place at the right time.

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:03]** Welcome to We'll Save!

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:03]** We'll Save!

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:08]** I am your hypnotizing GM, John Swan, and I want to know...

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** from my four wonderful cast members.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:17]** When those ads ran that were like, it's 10 p.m., where are your kids?

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** My question to you is, where were you as a kid?

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:23]** Or more importantly, where are you as an adult and your kids?

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** And it's 10 p.m.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:26]** Venny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** I'm just grooving.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** Man, it depends on how old I was.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** I know.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:38]** If it was like elementary, middle school, it was probably you and I sitting on a bed playing Super Smash Brothers.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:39]** That's probably true.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:43]** Or doing some sick flips on our fingerboards.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** Yo.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** Good times, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** That tech deck life, dude.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** Is that what you called them?

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** Yeah, the tech deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:57]** You had like this one huge module.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:02]** It had like a vert ramp on one side and like a kicker box on the other.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:02]** It was dope.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:03]** That was really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** That was fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:25]** uh i mean college i was probably at a party getting drunk uh maybe playing some music with some some jazz folks uh now i mean my kids go to bed around seven and so at 10 i'm probably in here editing or working or or you know trying to get my piano chops back okay

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:47]** whatever whatever yeah also playing a game maybe playing back to super smash i'm trying to make it full circle for you it's actually really fun to pull up to my daughter who's like oh my goodness daddy i'm better at this game than you and then i blow the dust off of my controller


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** You were playing left-handed the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** Yeah.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** Just tell her we're playing the GameCube version, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** And that's it.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** You better come correct.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:04]** Because she should have checked herself before she wrecked herself.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:09]** I'm not one of those parents that holds back.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** Blue spike shell.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:16]** If she comes at me, especially if it's a video game, I will absolutely let her have it.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:18]** There's zero chill.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** And then you just wreck it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** I love it.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** Who's up next, Vinny?

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** Kevin's up next.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** We'll start with the kids.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:30]** Kids are easy.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** Kids are easy.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]** Kids are just categorically easy.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** That's when Kevin goes to bed, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:38]** There's nothing easier about life than kids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** 10 p.m., they're in bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** Wait, Kev, but you're also in bed.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** Yeah, he is.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** At the same time as your kids, right?

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** Because you wake up at 4 a.m.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** Close.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:49]** Well, who goes to bed first, you or your kids?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:49]** 5.36.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:50 - 00:05:00]** My kids go to bed at, like, 7, and then, like, my wife and I usually, like, hang out and, like, do the evening routine and then, like, usually try to watch a show together.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:13]** And then 10 o'clock is about the time, like, she's in bed, and then that's when I get to watch the shows by myself, like, the ones that she won't watch with me, like Barry or some of the more violent shows that she just doesn't like to watch.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:19]** Back in the day, though, I would say I was thinking, like, man...

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:23]** Probably all the way through high school, 10 p.m.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** I was probably in my room playing video games.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** 90% of the time, I'd say.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** Nice.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:28]** 90% of the time.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** That tracks.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:36]** And then the time frame right after high school, before I joined the Navy, I think would be the only time that 10 p.m.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:41]** on a regular night was f***ing around doing something stupid.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:44]** And I'm going to leave it at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** That's it.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:46]** Okay.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:47]** All right.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:48]** Who's up next, Kev?

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:50]** No one will inquire or wonder about that at all.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Who's up next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:56]** I'm going to mix it up and go back to you, John.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:07]** This is actually a great... Can I just say that, John, you always get out of answering your own questions because you're the one asking them.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** I usually forget.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** I applaud your effort, Kevin.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** I applaud your effort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:14]** That's a great, oh man.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:20]** At 10 p.m., I also was usually playing video games.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** We're three for three now.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:26]** As it was later, I would often be playing music, typically.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:33]** If it were a Friday night, then I was playing with my quartet, the Irving Clements quartet.

**[00:06:33 - 00:07:03]** quartet yes andrew hansen and felix chang how is the three-man quartet yeah well you know i mean the big thing is that irving conf dude scurvy between 2000 and 2008 reported by the cdc truly i mean it really hits and as we know in florida oranges can be a shortage so and really any vitamin c so he just never showed up for any gigs but we still kept his name as an honorary yeah so who knows i don't know if like this is like

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** I am seeing none of this.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:04]** Who is the seller?

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** I can't see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:05]** It's so blurry.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:05]** I can't tell.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** There's only one left in stock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** You better order it soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** There's only one left.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:09]** No.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** This is wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:14]** Is somebody reselling your, like, mixtape?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** Okay, it's a full album.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** It's a full eight or nine tracks.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** No, no, no, it's okay.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:24]** I wasn't trying to say that.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:28]** It was just like, I'm not seeing any of this.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** I feel like it's secretly Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:38]** My side hustle is just schlepping your outfit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** Just raking in the profits from that hot item.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:41]** Love that.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:43]** I think we still have more in my closet.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:45]** Anyway, that's probably what I was doing, playing music.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:50]** And then, of course, as time went on, it was typically still the same and has been.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:54]** And then now it's also working on, we'll say, the podcast.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** So, yeah.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** That's it.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** That's me.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** You know who's next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:02]** What are you doing?

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** Wow.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:07]** Okay, so the question was what I was doing at 10 p.m.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:07]** Yeah.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** Throughout my lifetime.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** Yeah.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** Day by day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:14]** This is really revealing.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** No, I'm kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** Yeah, that's what I want.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:18]** Which century?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:24]** Because you could have been close to waking up for the midnight wake-up that used to happen, right?

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** Sure.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:30]** Are we pre- or post-industrial?


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:30]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:38]** So post-industrial revolution in the early 90s, late 80s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** 1880s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:40]** Yeah.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** Depends on what century.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:54]** But anyway, I was probably hanging out with my buddy Richard, and we were doing all the elite hacks or things that you did in the 90s with internet.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** Nice.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** Shout out to Richard.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Shout out, Richard.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:00]** The coolest cybersecurity sergeant on the planet.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:00]** Nice.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:04]** Yeah, we were doing hood rat things.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:10]** Later in high school, I was doing hood rat things with my friends, much like Kevin.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:15]** We don't need to go into it, but today...

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:23]** Today I'm usually working on this or making dinner super late or going out to dinner super late.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** It's more my speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:25]** I'm in.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:29]** I was convinced that was a movie trope until I actually came to LA.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** It's true, man.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** Making dinner at...

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** Going out at 10.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:36]** Dinner at 8 p.m.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** or 10 p.m.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:37]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:41]** Like, by 10, I'm having maybe another snack.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:44]** Dinner is promptly at 5.30 or 6.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:44]** 5.36?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** I mean, that might be lunch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** These guys made fun of me for it.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:51]** for the longest time.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** John still makes fun of me for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** Yeah, because I'd be like, Kev, let's go to dinner.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** And he's like, all right, I'm ready.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:57]** And I'm like, dude, it's five.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:57]** Chill out.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:59]** Like, hold up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** Is this an East Coast sort of thing?

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:06]** I remember like visiting family in the East Coast when I... And they would always have dinner or supper.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** They called it really early.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:10]** Is supper different than dinner?

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** I'm from like far East LA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:13]** Yeah.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:18]** I don't know if it's an East Coast thing or a function of having children.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** Because like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:21]** With a 7 o'clock bedtime, you have to feed them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** I was always a 5 o'clock dinner person.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:30]** But I'll argue that half the time, my dinners was actually regulated by the military.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** So dinner time was at 6 p.m.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:34]** That's fair.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** The galley closed at 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:44]** Which, for me, going from the East Coast to the West Coast was from a 6 o'clock dinner, which converted is a...

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** 3 o'clock dinner?

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:51]** I had to get a snack at 3 because you motherfuckers were eating at 8 to 9.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:53]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** Which is damn near midnight for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:59]** That's why you just gotta commit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:59 - 00:11:59]** That's it.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:01]** And just move here.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:05]** Well, and the benefit is...

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:30]** you're not wrong um the benefit is like i just have to listen to my body and if my body's hungry i'll eat it yeah and there's places like um oh what's that coffee spot right next to you to wait to which one silver lake to john the general store no there's so many of those though there's so many yeah the coffee place the one that's right between will and i oh it's classic yes classic spot

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:39]** I got a bag of granola from that place, and that sustained me while I was there, and I left there to go on a work trip, and it just lived in my backpack until I killed it all.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** It was really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:40]** Yeah.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** It's solid.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** I still haven't been to Deadlow.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** It is solid.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:44]** It is solid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:48]** I learned way too late in life to just keep snacks in my travel bag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:49]** Mmm.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** Sam, I keep it in my car, too.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** You never know.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:53]** It's important to keep your blood sugar stable, you know?

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:53]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:57]** There are two things that live in my travel bag all the time.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** Snacks.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** Protein bars.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:06]** And actually, yeah, I have a few on the shelf over there.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:11]** Will and I have established this weird mental connection over the last few weeks.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** It's pretty impressive.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:13]** Yeah.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** It's wild.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** That and wet wipes.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** Baby wipes.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:25]** Ever since having a kid and having baby wipes all the time, Kevin is nodding because he knows.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** He lives the life.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:34]** You don't realize how useful having a baby wipe is at any point in time until you have kids and you have them on hand at any point in time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:34 - 00:14:02]** we just stash them everywhere there's one in almost every door of the car there's yeah it's yeah anyways wow things i learned cool and kelly where were you at 10 p.m and does it involve wet webs everyone has such cool answers i feel like terrible now like uh i mean obviously video games is like a big one and you're hanging out with your friends when you're younger you know like elementary school junior high high school um i wrote uh

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:08]** I used to write fan fictions like when I was probably in a... I think it was like January.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:11]** So that's a pretty vulnerable thing to say, I guess.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** But anyway, I would do that.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** Thank you for sharing that with us.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:14]** Yeah, you're welcome.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:15]** Don't read them.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** Are you published?

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:18]** Are you also on Amazon for $60?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:24]** Maybe I could do what they did with... Because you know that what's it called?

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:28]** Started off as a fan fiction...

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** Fifty Shades of Grey was originally a Twilight.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:30]** Yes.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:31]** Really?

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** They repackaged it.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** Yes.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:34]** Wow.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Yes, it was.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:38]** So then you obviously can't sell it if that's the case.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:41]** So what they did was they rewrote it so I could rewrite them as like, you know, new.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** I could use all of our names.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:43]** Actually, I don't.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:45]** We should not do that.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** But anyway.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:50]** I can verify that Kevin was probably up to really weird things.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:55]** Like, at 10 p.m., there's an array of possibilities of what that is that I can think of.

**[00:14:55 - 00:15:04]** But one possible thing is, like, in Nashville, like, Kevin was drunk as f*** and he hopped on my back like a monkey and was just like, carry me around downtown Nashville, Kelly.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:07]** And it was just like a 90s... That wasn't an everyday thing.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** That was every night at 10 p.m.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:12]** I feel like this happened all the time, Kevin, in one something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** That was one weekend in Nashville.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** Did I miss... Where was I for this?

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** You were there for this.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:18]** We just got out of the bars.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:20]** I did not see Kelly on anyone's back.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** I think that's right after you said, fuck up and walked off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** No, it was the other way around.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Kevin was on my back.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** Yeah.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:28]** I didn't see Kevin on anybody's back.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** He was a maniac, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:36]** Was this when I disappeared off to... Yeah, when you just... Yeah, I think the literal quote was, fuck them as you walk away.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** Did you say that?

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:41]** He did.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** He did.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:42]** Who was?

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:46]** Casey was like, that's why no Will is drunk.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:51]** Casey was like, okay, I'm ready to leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** I want to just like, I'm ready to go.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:53]** Let's go.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:55]** I was like, all right, Casey, bet.

**[00:15:55 - 00:16:09]** you know talk yo get out of here john's brother-in-law future brother-in-law so like casey was ready to go i was with him and then he made it three quarters of the way out turned around to see if anybody followed i was like it doesn't matter if they follow it if you're done you're done

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:12]** And so he walked out and I walked out with him.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** It was like, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** And we were trying to follow, but Kelly was too slow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** What are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** That's why I kept shouting giddy up.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:21]** This is not giddy up, Kelly.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** You were too drunk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** You cannot remember.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** You were just a monkey of chaos.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:26]** That's all you were.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:30]** You were like going around like trying to grab on trees and that's not, this is not, we're not the hero of the night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** You were Shaq for a moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** He was Shaq.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:35]** We danced, kept talking to people.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** It's classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** Drunk Kev.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:37]** Indeed.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** I am a social butterfly.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:42]** Casey was sort of decaffing, which I almost admired.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:43]** I know what you mean.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** What is decaffing?

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** He just, like, didn't give a fuck.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** Don't give a fuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:52]** Yeah, he was, like, partying, having a good time, and then he was like, all right, I want to go.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** That was wrong.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:53]** Fog has ended.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** So I hope that retreated to the shadows.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:56]** No.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:58]** All right.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:58]** Yeah.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:02]** Should we play?

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:04]** Yeah.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** No?

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** No?

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** Okay.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:08]** Group vote on it.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:09]** Who wants to play?

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** 3, 2, 1, raise your hand.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** I'm outvoted.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** Alright, we'll play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:18]** No, I mean, it's an all or nothing.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:23]** I'll side with Kevin just spiritually, but we'll still have to play.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** I'll side with Kevin spiritually.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:27]** It doesn't feel like he's alone, but it's still 3-2, so we'll play.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:27]** Wow.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:31]** I don't want him to hop on my back again later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:36]** Alright, well, just pretend it's 10pm and you're getting new content for your fanfiction, Kelly.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:36]** So let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:41]** It's about a man and his monkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:48]** That's all we're going to leave it at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:52]** That's all we're going to leave it at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** Just a man and his monkey.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** That's going to be the thumbnail for this episode.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:57]** That's absolutely the thumbnail.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** We have to make it a doable title.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:01]** What was that again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** A man and his monkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** Just a man and his monkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:07]** Someone has to say it throughout this episode.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** Well, we'll try to drop it in between.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** If anyone finds a good opportunity moment.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** Please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:13]** Randomly.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** Somebody start a timer.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:19]** I feel like it has to be part of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:21]** The challenge is to find a really good moment.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:21]** Right.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** Exactly.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** And to turn Kevin bright red.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:28]** I don't know if I've ever come off it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:35]** What began as a restful respite?

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** Respite?

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:55]** for our crew has flash forward turned into a specific level of hell those are not my words a fresh hell one might say fresh hell yes each of them as they slept or rather Colin Dr. O.K.

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:05]** and here's was woken up by Rick 19 classic classic Rick 19 waking it all up in the middle of the night he kills your dreams as well laughing

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:10]** As his worries of an event.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:15]** Kev just left the video call and came back.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:15]** Sorry, Kevin.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:18]** I think that was a bandwidth issue.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** Maybe that was a bandwidth issue, but it was perfectly timed.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:24]** As Rick19's worries of an event.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:29]** That something has transpired and he needs to talk to y'all.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:49]** As you all wake up, you notice some strange feelings, sensations in your body as you discover individually some sort of scarring or mutilation, evidence of some sort of operation.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:59]** You begin to share some of these details with Shea Dysha, one of the head stewards of

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:09]** And throughout your discovery and discussion, Colin remembers the technique of hypnotism.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:14]** And last episode, Colin did some hypnotizing.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** Rick19 was first.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:39]** Rick 19 remembered memories of being sent to bed, memories of having your right arm pricked over and over and over again, and then coming back and walking in single file back to the galley to the exact position that you were 24 hours later.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:54]** had memories of the urge to sit up in bed, commanded to put their feet, their Osharu feet on the ground.

**[00:20:54 - 00:21:01]** Memories of their body leaving the Void Crier, being off the ship, and then Dr.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** O.K.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:13]** 's right arm in a machine that escalated in pain, pushing past your pain tolerance, and you were flailing on the bed as your crewmates were watching you.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:21]** You successfully got through your wool save, and right before you came to, you saw...

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:25]** other members of the crew lying in a room with you.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:46]** Hears was next, starting with a dream that Hears was having about Rolu until you were pulled out of the dream and onto wherever this experimentation was occurring.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:55]** You sensed this cold apathy of the greys, of anger, before your antennae gets cut

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** Just sheared off.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** It sucks.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:12]** And at the end, before you woke up, you recall the detail of Torv Greycrag walking out of the room that you were in, that others were in.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:19]** Other cast, sorry, crew, and Pike's Paratons.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:21]** Shay comes to the door.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:25]** You all start swapping information.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:31]** Shay has been talking with Narla, trying to work through what has happened to the ship.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:47]** You find out that the computer is missing 24 hours of data, but there is some sensor data that shows an EMP that hit the void crier.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:50]** And you all are looking through.

**[00:22:50 - 00:23:02]** Turns out that EMP is somewhere came originated from the back hemisphere of the ship behind you, above you, to the left, to the right, but behind you.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:08]** Shay says, we haven't moved from where we were 24 hours ago.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:15]** You all convince Shay to do a hypnosis.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:19]** Go under Colin's watchful gaze.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:23]** There's a sound in Shay's mind that's deep.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:32]** A voice that's telling him to close his eyes and never open them.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:41]** That they'll have no senses, no contact with any single being like a punishment.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** They come back.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** You check.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:52]** Shay has no scarring, mutation, evidence physically of any abductions.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:57]** And right where we ended was when we found that there is a device.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** Dr.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:10]** O.K., I believe you recall that there is a device called a drift shadow projector that prevents a spacecraft from

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:16]** From using its drift drive and engine.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:28]** But the thing is, it only works within 10 hexes of the ship that it's trying to affect.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:34]** So we are going to, in Foundry, where I have somehow... Oh, there's Foundry.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** I couldn't find my tab.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:39]** I'm going to bring you all over to the Void Crier.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:46]** We are back in the room that was, I believe, Collins and Dr. O'Kay's.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** Shay is with you.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:53]** What are you all doing?

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:58]** Dr. O'Kay, you were the last to have that piece of information come to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:16]** So Dr. Arcade is going to relay this info and say, I think there might be a drift shadow projector hindering our progress through the drift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:20]** Is it possible that that is currently operating on us or a one-time device?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:24]** Well, we haven't moved yet.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:29]** My understanding is that our drift engines are out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:35]** So... What do you mean, out?

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** We can't access them.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:41]** And we need our drift engines in order to help us navigate through the drift.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:51]** There's still some use of our non-drift engines, but those are the ones that are critical if we're going to make it through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** Aye, we are in the drift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:57]** Yes, we are.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:59]** Here's the thing.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:08]** You're telling me that greys have abducted us.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:08]** Yes.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** I remember these feelings.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:17]** you all have some sort of physical scarring.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:18]** Yes.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:20]** The drift engine doesn't move.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:24]** Some EMP, or the drift drive doesn't work.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:32]** Some EMP has hit the void crier, and now you're saying that they're nearby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:33]** Perhaps.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:39]** Can we show him the footage from Bernice?

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** Would that be helpful?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:46]** You would recall that Bernice doesn't have recording capabilities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** Yeah.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** But we can check.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:54]** Perhaps the shape might make sense to see if Melt-A-Man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:55]** You did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:56]** Yep.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:57]** All right.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:00]** Do you know... Okay.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** A couple things going through my head.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** Do you know the Muffin Man?

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:05]** Oh.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:06]** The Muffin Man?


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** The Melt-A-Man.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:08]** The Melt-A-Man.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:12]** That lives up on the main deck lane.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:12]** He's over there.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** Do you know the Melt-A-Man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Stop hypnotizing me again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** Do you know the Melt-A-Man?

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:24]** Is that Melt-A-Man with a hyphen or is that all one word?

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** For my own memory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:32]** That's a very specific question, but it is with a hyphen, technically.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:37]** If you watch all the holo vids in the holo series, then yes, it's with a hyphen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** It depends on the market.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:43]** The marketing people obviously changed up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:46]** Wait, is this supposed to be like a show that he's a fan of?

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** Yeah, well, so I mean...

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:48]** Like this is a toy from a show?

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** I mean, think about this, right?

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:55]** In Castrovelian, the hyphen is often used in only specific religious texts.

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:05]** So would Melt-A-Man premiering want to say that they're trying to take a religious stance on what's happening by putting a hyphen in between Melt-A-Man?

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** Absolutely not.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:09]** That's a whole whirlwind of smoke and storm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** Nobody wants to open up that can of worms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** Absolutely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:13]** The universe is so vast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:16]** There's so many crazy ideas and conflicts out there.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:17]** Exactly.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** You've got to be careful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:23]** It's why it's truly difficult to make any media that can be consumed by everyone all at once.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:23]** That's true.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** Here's you.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** You absolutely get it.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** Here's.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:34]** Also, I never realized here is that the way that I talk and the way that you talk, kind of similar.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:38]** Yeah, it's a little... You both talk through your mandibles.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** It's a little suspicious.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Yeah.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** Shay grows mandibles.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** I don't know what you're talking about.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** These aren't mine.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** He takes them off.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:45]** Oh, he has antenna, though.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** He has antenna.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** Yeah, Shay is a... Oh, we have antenna.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:48]** That's why.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Yeah.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** That's probably why.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** Here's his antenna's cut off.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** He's probably going to speak a little higher now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:56]** It's really unfortunate.

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:00]** You could say that the greys were shearing him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:05]** What's going on?

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:07]** I will get revenge on them for this, by the way.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:11]** I don't know why I'm the only one with permanent f***ing damage, John.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** Like, I'm scarred permanently.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** Colin lost a kidney.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Who cares?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** It's not like a f***ing visual thing.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:21]** They cut him from the f***ing belly button down to his pelvis.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** I don't know what the f*** they did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** You're fine.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:26]** You're fine.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** You could just turn into a tattoo.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** Don't gaslight me.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** Just grow another one.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** Be kind of cool.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:40]** All right, look, so I think talking to Melt-A-Man, seeing what they have would be good.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:44]** Kev, your question of is Melt-A-Man some sort of a show?

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:52]** Yeah, without a culture check, you would know that Melt-A-Man is actually based on a HoloVid series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** Okay, you probably mentioned that.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** I missed it for some reason.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:59]** So this is like a replica or a toy or something from that show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** No, he's a fan.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** No, it's an actual drone, right?

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:06]** So, like, in the show, Melted Man travels the galaxy.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** It's very kid-friendly.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:11]** Like, befriends kids, saves settlements from nearby monsters, right?

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:14]** It's very, very... What is it?

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:15]** Um...

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:16]** Power Rangers.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:20]** Danger Will Robinson, you know, like that kind of a sense.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:20]** Lost in Space?

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Lost in Space, yeah, yeah.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** The older one, right?

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:29]** But the Melt-A-Man drone is a model, a special edition model that you can purchase.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:37]** And, you know, that one has a lot of the catchy, kitschy phrases and symbols and things.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:42]** Right, he's the fancy Transformers toy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:47]** He's the fancy Transformers professional series drone that could hurt you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:52]** All right, let's go see this Melt-A-Man and see if he's got some answers for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** I got a question.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:55]** Have you talked to any of the Pyke's Peritons?

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:59]** Do you know what's going on with them at all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** Shay, we barely left this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** I did.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:05]** I talked to them a little bit.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** Is Torv a Pyke's Periton?

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Yeah, Torv is the Pyke's Periton.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:18]** Torv's the only one that I know of would be Torv had an issue with his eye prior to leaving the mess hall.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:28]** And I believe one of us in our memory of the last 24 hours saw Torv being directed into another room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:28]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:35]** By the way, everyone, every one of us, including all the pikes, I think I saw all of them in my memories.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:37]** Everyone has been experimented on, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** That's not disconcerting at all.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:40]** Except you, Shay.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** All right.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** Okay.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:46]** We wouldn't want anyone to be left out.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** Yeah, definitely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** We're all in this together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** We are all in this together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:53]** We're all in this together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:56]** So is there something with the Pyke's Peritons that you know of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:01]** No, I mean, Gnarla is up in the...

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:05]** deck in the captain's chair.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:05]** The bridge?

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** Thank you.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** Just haven't really slept.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** It's still the middle of the night.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** So Gnarla is up there.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:15]** I know Gnarla wanted... Let's see.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** Fetch, probably.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:21]** I think Gnarla sent Hesper down to look at the engine.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:26]** I think probably Ezra needs to come up.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:28]** Ezra knows a lot about scanning.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:31]** And Sarzel...

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** Some of them might be asleep.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** Some of them might not.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:39]** So I don't know too much about all of them.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:43]** I think maybe we check on Torv and we talk to Meltaman.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:46]** But the big thing is that Gnarla needs to know that we are now...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:48 - 00:33:16]** under threat right this has moved from an invasion and an abduction to now we are at a position where we need to make some calls so all right under threat i think the threat has already uh hit us i mean that's that's based on i believe under attack would be the more appropriate turn on respectfully i feel like we're never left alone right the greys are here still in some capacity i feel it's very possible


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:20]** It's certainly a concern that we need to address.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** I... That's... Yes.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:26]** It's a very urgent concern that we need to address.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:29]** Let's go.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:34]** We're... Is it possible to do in all hands and have everyone report to the same area?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:35]** Yep.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** How many hands are you expecting?

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:44]** Yeah, I don't know how many hands you're thinking about here, but people... We need people... Twice as many as the number of people on the ship.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:45]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:47]** Oh, there's more than that, though, if you think about it.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:49]** Shay, how many are on this ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** How many are on this ship?

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:55]** There are going to be, including you all, I believe there are 16 on this ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** Sorry, 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:59]** There are at least four on this ship.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:04]** Look, let's go check in on Torv.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:10]** We'll go see what's up with Melt Demand and check their files.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** And then we need to let Gnarla know.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** All right.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:14]** Let's go.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** Let's go.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:20]** Shay walks out very decidedly.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:30]** You can tell that Shay is moving from, let's say, casual to addressing a threat.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:34]** This is a... Before...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:56]** before, like, Shane walks out the room, but before anybody else starts to go, I think Rick kind of steps in front of the door, and, like, speaking to these three, says, like, I would hate to split up the party, but it might be necessary under these situations in order to not miss something that is happening.

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:03]** Is it... My concerns are the engines, as well as what is going on with Meltaman.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** And possibly the pikes.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:14]** I say this very cautiously, but I think we might need to separate in order to fully cover everything that's happening on this ship.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** You hear... Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:22]** As Shea is knocking on the door and ringing the door to go into Tor's room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** Colin steps out.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:33]** I think as we research what's going on with the Greys, we'll get more information about the engine and what might be wrong with it.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:42]** I've got a sneaking suspicion that the engines are fine, but there's something outside the ship that might be stopping them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:44]** Right, and the bridge would be the place to tell that, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** Presumably.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** My piloting skills are not that great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:52]** Shay is talking to Tor.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:54]** We should head down there.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** You see the door opening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:59]** Call in like jogs down to Tor's room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:02]** Rick will follow, but he's actually going to stay in the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** Hey, Orgat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** Colin follows Shay in.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:08]** Okay.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** Hey, Orgat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:10]** Hey, Torv.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** Turns on the light.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:16]** You see Orgat was sleeping.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:21]** And he's like, what's going on?

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:24]** And Torv was also sleeping.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:25]** Sits up.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:31]** Hey, as everyone comes in to the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** It's the smallest room ever, too.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:36]** It's so small.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:41]** We're just literally standing over them breathing heavily unless they wake up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:44]** Don't be alarmed.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:44]** What's that?

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:47]** There's been a kidnapping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:50]** Colin, is Torb the only one in that room?

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:50]** Or God is also in there.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** For some reason.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:52]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:52 - 00:37:03]** Orgat Nalkas is the half-orc that was the devotee of Phrasma who was reading the book in the lounge when you all were taking a little tour.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Right, I remember all of that.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** Hey, look, I'm sorry to wake you both up in the middle of the night.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** There...

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:20]** Not to alarm you, but we do have a situation going on, and I do need the two of you at your professional best right now.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:23]** Torv, I need to ask you a question.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:29]** And Torv actually turns over, and you see that their eye has become red.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:47]** now rick sees that and goes it was green before it was green before ah i'm just kidding he doesn't actually say that but just a reminder i think rick would have told you that like his eye was orange during the game and it turned to green as we came out of the time warp colin raises his hand


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:49]** As if he has a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:53]** Yeah, I'm going to let Colin talk to this because they have some more information.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** So please speak to this as much as you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:56 - 00:38:04]** Torv, before I ask, try to do my best to fill you in because I don't know that I truly understand it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** What is going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:10]** What significance does your eye color have?

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** What does that mean?

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** That it's red right now?

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:17]** It's... It's red right now?

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Uh... It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** Okay.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** He's not aware of that, huh?

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:21]** Okay.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** Probably hasn't looked in the mirror.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:24]** He just woke up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:28]** That is... I've seen it a few different colors.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:30]** What do the colors mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:34]** It is not supposed to change colors.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:39]** So that is disconcerting, to say the least.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:46]** This happened last night when I was told that it was green.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:50]** And you can tell that this has rocked their world a little bit.

**[00:38:51 - 00:39:01]** For somebody who is clearly a soldier, mercenary, has control and autonomy over their body, this doesn't sit right with them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:09]** Torv, what if I told you that last night was not last night.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:14]** It was about 24 hours longer than you thought it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:23]** Torv reaches over, picks up something, and looks past you, confused.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:26]** Can I rule out perception?

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** What did he pick up?

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:33]** He just picked up his nearby data pad that everyone had to check on the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:36]** He checked his phone.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:46]** Torv, we've been experimenting with how to respond to this, right?

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:50]** And what we found is effective is a bit of hypnosis.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** Have you ever seen hypnosis before?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** I have not.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** And you see there's a

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:08]** From Orgoth, there's like a curiosity as Orgoth sits up in bed to take in what's happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:11]** Would you be opposed to trying it?

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:26]** If it helps, everyone else in this room, except for Orgoth, if you'd like, we can do it in just a minute, has done it and recovered some portion of their memories over the last 24 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:31]** Before we begin with that, may I examine your eye?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:32]** I?

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** I've no opposition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** Torf?

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** Yes.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:37]** Yes.

**[00:40:38 - 00:41:01]** torv scoots closer to the bed and leans in puts their eye right up uh would this be like an engineering or medicine check it's a good question i think you could do you could you could probably do some semblance of computers maybe engineering maybe and medicine maybe

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:10]** Okay, so if I roll all three... You don't have time to roll all three.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** I rolled a 97.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:13]** Yeah, Dr. Okay rolls a 100.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:20]** No, I mean, I can do... I think Rick would be standing at the door, and so I'm going to roll to assist if that's the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:26]** I don't know that you can roll to assist, Kevin, because you're Rick, because you're pretty far away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:29]** I'll do a medicine check, just to see.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:31]** I would like to assist his medicine check, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:31]** Huh?

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** I can't help with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:37]** Yeah, it's also a small room, so... So I'm not standing that far away, because it's that small room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:39]** And I get a plus 11, so I automatically assist.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Plus 11, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** So I got...

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:46]** Wow.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** Nice.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:47]** Wow.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:49]** I mean, it's a classic doctor.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** I'm going to try this.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** Does it with flying colors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** Yeah.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:58]** I'm going to look at this thing that I haven't really ever looked at too much, but I'm going to see what I can see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:01]** Well, you just gave me a 30 unless I can't assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** No, no, no.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** You can totally assist.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:10]** The thing is, is that without like putting Torv under and taking their eye out and looking too much at it, there's dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:13]** You're limited.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:16]** So my engineering is the same as my medicine.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:16]** That's fine.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:19]** So there's not like a socket for his eye?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:24]** I mean, you're asking about the Starfinder sci-fi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:45]** Like, you can go in, but... I'm trying to assess what sort of conditions would effectively turn his eye red, and what, if any... I guess my concern with hypnosis is that Torv might be under some undue influence, or something might be, like...

**[00:42:45 - 00:43:00]** uncovered during this hypnosis and I just want to identify and call it out beforehand or see if he's like in a shape that would allow for him to respond well to hypnosis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:05]** Yeah, I feel like the medicine check would give you more of like how the eye interacts with the body.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Well, yeah.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** Same thing with engineering.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** That's what I was kind of trying to get.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:13]** A computer's check would probably give you something about with the eye, its status itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:13]** Okay.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** I can assist with the medicine check.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** I cannot assist with the engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:19]** And you got a 30 on medicine or engineering doctor?

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Medicine.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:24]** But my engineering and my medicine are below plus 13.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** With the assist, I got to 30.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:30]** So you'd have 30 medicine, 28 engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:30]** Got it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:53]** So I think it's pretty clear to you that whereas this eye was mostly before used to enhance vision, dark vision, low light vision, it is now appeared that it has been replaced or modified to have a laser inside of it.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** Like a weapon?

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** Yeah.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** That's kind of cool.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** I don't know this yet, but it's cool.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:05]** What is going on with my eye?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:12]** I think rather than augment your vision, it's augmented your weapons.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:25]** Why don't you try and focus perhaps on the wall or some other part and see if you can use your mind to initiate the laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** I like how that's dropping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:35]** Sorry, so you would like me to shoot a laser across the room?

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** The tiny room.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:40]** I don't want you to do it in an uncontrolled way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:44]** Maybe let's just hold off on firing off here.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:50]** But, okay, it sounds like, Dr. O'Keefe, you've uncovered something that, Torv, am I right?

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:54]** This was not what you had previously in your eye, correct?

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:57]** No, it is not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:58]** Wow, Torv.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** How do you feel about that?

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:03]** Is that kind of cool or kind of alarming?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Torv just looks at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** It is mostly alarming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:14]** Steering a loved one intently in the face and then all of a sudden up literally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** That would really suck, Torv.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:18]** Yeah, you got to get it figured out real quick.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** Got to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** Like looking straight into a lightsaber.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:28]** It would make for some pretty cool final finish skills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:32]** I like that attitude.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:38]** Doctor, it doesn't seem that you've noticed anything that would prevent a hypnosis from working.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Is that correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** Not that I can tell.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:51]** Although my concern is being startled or alarmed with a laser for an eye that you've never tested out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Sure.

**[00:45:52 - 00:46:03]** So, like, Colin walks up to Torv and, like, very intentionally scoots over to the side and, like, holds his pocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:06]** We're good.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:06]** I don't know.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** Do you want to stick around for this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:14]** I am very interested in staying around for this, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Torv, do you mind?

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** Let's try this.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** All right.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:40]** hypnosis yeah all right uh if you don't mind i'm going to step over here and uh just uh keep your eyes locked on this locket here it's definitely not in front of any soft matter you uh you feel yourself moving moving through the drift

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:47]** And you see the shining lights, the different colors.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:55]** All of a sudden, you see a break, and the colors fade into the black of space.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** You've reached your destination.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:01]** Now, this destination is your memories of the last 24 hours.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:07]** Hours and hours and hours.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** What is it that you see, Torfin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:13]** Are you going to make a mysticism or diplomacy check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** You know, I should probably roll some dice, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** Just to see what's going on.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:19]** Just to find out what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:22]** I thought you were just going to give it to me for a second.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** Hang on.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** Hang on.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** This is diplomacy, right?

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:27]** This is.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Or mysticism.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** Whichever one's lower.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:31]** Correct.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:33]** 17.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:33]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:45]** You begin, you're swinging your pendant that says, if you can see this, you are hypnotized.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:49]** And Torv closes their eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:47:49 - 00:48:04]** There's a change in the room as Torv starts just rocking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:12]** The game is playing.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:23]** I cannot see who scored because it stopped.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:26]** No one is cheering.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:31]** I need to go to my room.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** I'm walking.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:38]** We are all walking suddenly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:40]** And our doors are open.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:43]** I want to sit.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:48]** And now there's a white light that just appeared.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:50]** And I'm moving.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:52]** And I'm moving through the wall.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:53]** And...

**[00:48:53 - 00:49:00]** And I am actually moving outside into the drift.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:07]** And it is loud in here.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:13]** And you see that they are clutching their arms and they're cold.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** And then they ease.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:21]** I'm still cold, but it's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:27]** If it is flat, I think I can... There's a white light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** It's clean.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:33]** I can see Hesper on my left.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:37]** I think that's Firespitter on my right.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:40]** Oh, wait.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:42]** Only one eye is working.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:42]** Okay.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** Okay.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:46]** That is not correct.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** There's something in front of me.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** It's not smiling, though.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** I just, there's no mouth.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:56]** There's just gray skin.

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:00]** There's something long in its hand that I can see.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:04]** No, no, don't, don't use that on me.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** What, what is that?

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** And for a second, they almost seize up.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** Orgott leans forward on the bed.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:21]** Okay, I can see a little more.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:24]** I'm not feeling so cold.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:28]** Okay, I'm in a different room.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:38]** There is no one else here, but I can see you all in other rooms.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:43]** There's a gray alien in every room.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:51]** One of them has its hand in a comforting way.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:53]** The bench is cold.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:56]** There is a voice in my head.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:58]** I am okay.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:01]** I am safe with them.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:03]** There is no harm.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:10]** This eye is to make me stronger, to teach me.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:13]** The voice is saying,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:45]** saying words like deserving and dangerous and then they wake up yo and like cyclops that shoot a beam of laser shoots a laser at you no that was unexpected Colin


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:49]** Well, yeah.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:55]** There's quite a shock in Mary's that you don't know you've got.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:57]** Did you see me there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:59]** Orgot says.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** Did you see him?


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:03]** Oh, ****.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:06]** Sorry, that was to Urgot.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** Yes, here's you.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** I saw a bunch of you.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:15]** I saw you in my own vision, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** Okay.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:20]** Urgot, do you remember anything from the last 24 hours?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Hours.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** Hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** I do not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:27]** I do not remember anything.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** No.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:30]** Time for the hypnotism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:33]** John, I hope you have something set up for every single person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** Melt a man to everyone.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** He's like, duh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** We're going to hypnotize the greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:41]** I think we're just going to keep hitting this button until John starts recycling memories.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:44]** And then we know.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** We've reached the bottom of the barrel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** I don't remember anything.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** And they sit up.

**[00:52:54 - 00:53:00]** There's kind of a glee and a little bit of a fascination and curiosity in their voice.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:05]** And then their hand stops as they were just rubbing their head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** It's been furrowed in the head.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** What is on my hand?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** Is there a sense motive on that?

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** What is on and turns around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:17]** Please, no, not a cortex bone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:25]** So, yeah, I think Colin steps toward Orgott, like, in this indecision, just to, like, examine what that might be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:30]** Yeah, Dr. O'Keefe is going to step into the room and help assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:35]** Sorry, you are... So, to be clear, you are examining what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:40]** Or got in, like, the wound or whatever he has felt on the back of his head.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** May we take a look at your head?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:45]** Yes, you can.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** And they turn around.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:54]** You don't need a medicine check to know that they've had a hole put in their head.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:56]** It's very, very small.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:59]** Probably too small to be, like, a cortex bomb or anything.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Just a hole.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Like you're pulling ice out of a lake.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Like a sand bowl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:08]** Is there any indication how deep this hole goes?

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Maybe.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** Introduce.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** Doctor, have you seen anything like this?

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** What check would I do for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:20]** Medicine check?

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:22]** Has Colin seen anything like this?

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** I rolled a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** I have a 2.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:29]** That's a natural 20 for 31.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:37]** The idea that trepanation can be a cure for or use as any sort of relief.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:38]** Hang on.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** Hang on while I Google trepanation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** It's like old school, like.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:44]** It's like phrenology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** Yeah.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:53]** It doesn't seem like it is any reliable method that is used by medical professionals in the star or in the back worlds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** They're not even like.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** They haven't even taken their boards.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** They're not.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:02]** You could go around kidnapping people.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:03]** You might as well do a good job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:07]** This is a skull hole for the sake of a skull hole.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:08]** Wow.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** Okay.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** Is that correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:13]** I mean, if they removed a tumor, then, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:22]** Dr. O'K, you did notice that Torv, and this is not anything new, it seemed like their skin was nice.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:26]** Other than their eye, they seem to be well-rested.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:31]** And Orgott, too, as you look, seems to be in very good health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** You've said that.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:37]** You said we all feel really good, except for our resolve, apparently, has not been filled.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:41]** But that sounds like a personal problem.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** Got him.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:42]** Got him.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** No, I didn't...

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:55]** But that could just be, like, they're using, like, the relax you or some kind of, like, rejuvenation chamber or something while they're cutting open our guts and brains.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:57]** Like, f*** Greys.

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:59]** F*** them all the way to hell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:03]** Shay, have you heard anything yet?

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** What is happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:12]** Shay picks up the comms, just puts it up like a phone, and says, Yeah, so...

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:15]** There are some things that you need to know about.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:21]** We are wrapping up some new information, bundling it together.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:23]** I'm going to put it in a nice bow tie and bring it to you in just a little bit.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** Hang on, Harla.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** Hangs up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:35]** So, were you asking if you would like to hypnotize me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:37]** Is that right?

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** Aye.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:44]** Though I wonder if you need hypnotism like you need another hole in your head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:52]** That's their laugh.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** It takes a few seconds as they realize what you said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:58]** Maybe the greys can solve, like, Kevin's, like, uh, fuck, Dr. Pepper addiction.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** You just opened up another can, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:04]** What's wrong with... Okay, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:05]** Two things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** Just a man with his monkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:09]** There's nothing wrong with my Dr. Pepper.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** You just opened a second one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:11]** You just opened a can.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:15]** That bottle is half f***ing finished, and you opened a can just now.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** Right now, next to it.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** You had my can of beer.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** Oh, okay.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:19]** All right, whatever.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** It looked like Dr. Pepper.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:23]** This is so good.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:26]** This is a theoretical jam, Weed Ale, from Cigar City.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** I apologize.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** I thought that... Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** Shout out Tampa, Florida.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** Kevin pulls off the label, and it's Dr. Pepper.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** You know, for the longest time, I climbed the label.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:37]** Yeah, right.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:37]** Aw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:40]** He's not even from Texas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** He's not even from Texas.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:45]** For the longest time, I was like, man, I need to buy myself a mini fridge.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:49]** My sister had a six-pack mini fridge at one point that was only like $100 or something.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** Totally worth it.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:53]** But I was like, man, I'm just going to start using ice chests.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:59]** So now every time we record, I bring in at least three beers into an ice chest and put an ice pack with it.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:03]** I can't play with you guys sober.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** Especially not three-fold conspiracy.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** Wow, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:10]** I don't know if that's a compliment or something to be worried about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:10]** I don't know.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** I think it's a parent thing.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:14]** I can't either.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:19]** I got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:23]** I don't want to encourage people to drink with their friends, but sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:29]** So I've futzed my fake locket.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** So here we go.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:35]** Colin starts swinging his locket in front of dude's eyes.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** Her eyes.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:38]** Her eyes.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:43]** Follow this locket with your eyes.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:52]** As you drift off and focus on the locket, you step into your favorite bar.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:56]** And you belly up to the bar.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:58]** You sit in your favorite bar stool.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:04]** You turn to the barkeep and say, Barkeep, I'll have my usual.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** The barkeeper.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:10]** I love Shirley Temples.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:18]** Staves off to you with a frosted mug and you see him pour in the Sprite and the Grenadine.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** Tops it with the best cherry you've ever seen.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** More Grenadine.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** More Grenadine.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:32]** And what you see in that Grenadine bottle are your memories of the last 24 hours.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Hours.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:34]** Hours.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:38]** As you take the first sip, you rush back into your head.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** What is it that you see?

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:47]** What's your roll?

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** Even more grenadine.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** Oh, shit!

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** What?

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:52]** What'd you get?

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:56]** That is a 19 on the die.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:56]** A 27.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** 27?

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** Yo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** Yo.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** Yo.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:03]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** You remember everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:07]** It's gonna be a good f***ing flashback.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:10]** She goes all the way back to her childhood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:13]** The entire memory is just her chugging Shirley Temples.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:22]** The first thing that I remember is sitting with my parents.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:26]** They hand me a cup of red liquid.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** So good.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** I need more of it.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** Oh, sorry.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:35]** Just a bottle of Grenadine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:43]** Just straight Grenadine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:51]** Okay, so I'm... I'm... I'm sitting, watching the game, drinking my straight Grenadine.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:53]** And...

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:56]** Oh, yeah, I'd love to read Sonics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:57]** Don't do this, people.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** Don't drink straight.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:00]** That's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:02]** What's wrong with that?

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:02]** That's so good.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:04]** Just coach your throat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** That's so good.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:09]** Cops are up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:11]** I never have a bad time drinking straight cardinol.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:17]** I'm so uncomfortable right now.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** I want to sit.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:22]** I want to sit down on my bed.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:24]** Oh, Torv is here.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:27]** Where are we?

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:29]** Where are we?

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:30]** Where are we?

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]** Is this it?

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:38]** Is this when I... Is this when I meet... Is this when I meet Erasmus?

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:39]** Is this it?

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:41]** Because I'm leaving my body.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:45]** I am... I am leaving the ship.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** And there is a white light.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:56]** And it is... It is so... Oh, it's so... Oh, it's so cold.

**[01:01:56 - 01:02:03]** And I can feel the metal beneath me, and this must be it.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:12]** I am with forasmus the afterlife, except...

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:17]** Why is... Why are you here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:20]** A man and his monkey appear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** Oh, sorry.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** Why are you here?

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:24]** I tried, I tried.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:26]** What is that monkey doing in the corner?

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:29]** Why is it drinking my grenadine?

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:31]** Oh, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]** It's a man and his monkey.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:34]** It's a C-plus on the insert.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:35]** It didn't work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:37]** Wait.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** There are...

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:44]** There's a gray alien.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:50]** It's putting a needle in Torv's eye.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:56]** That is... Oh, wait, another one is walking to me.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:59]** There's some sort of tool.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:02]** This is not the afterlife.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** This is not it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:14]** This is not... Oh, this is... This is not... And they wake up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** And they open their eyes.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:22]** And they are silent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:28]** Oh, sorry, man.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:29]** Ma'am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:32]** You were all there.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:40]** And I could see... I could see others sitting with other greys.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:43]** And I could see them talking to you.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:47]** And talking... To Hesper.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:50]** And to... And to Narla.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** And to you, Shay.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:52]** He looks up at Shay.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:55]** And there's a hole...

**[01:03:55 - 01:04:01]** In my head, this is not, this is not what.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:12]** There's an anger that seems very unbecoming from the curiosity that was there moments ago.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:22]** And there is a deep primal sense that they are on the verge of losing it because they failed their will safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:24]** Oh, okay.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:25]** Damn.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:28]** Not good.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:30]** Can we help her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:31]** Focus.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:31]** Focus here.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:33]** I'm right here.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:34]** Focus.

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:36]** Right here.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:36]** Look at me.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:37]** Look at me.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:38]** You're safe.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:40]** You're surrounded.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:43]** Surrounded by things.

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:45]** This is Shay talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:45]** Look, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:54]** I am very appreciative of this call, and I think we just... I'm very glad that you could do this.

**[01:04:54 - 01:05:00]** Let's just... Now we know that there could be some side effects, or God, it's... Just take a second.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:14]** Shay's trying to just let you all know that if this is going to happen again, there could be some... Clearly there are some consequences that hasn't happened before.


## Speaker_0

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:14]** I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:17]** Sense motive on Shay.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:23]** I got an eight plus probably my zero, I think.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** Let me just...

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:27]** Yep, zero.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:30]** So he's like, I agree, Shay.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:31]** This seems dangerous.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:32]** I'm not sure we should continue with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:36]** I don't know that I'm saying that, Rick, but I appreciate your abundance of caution here.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:49]** I'm just saying that if we need to do it again, let's be judicious and make sure we follow all the practical laws of ethics and testing, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:51]** Are you saying that we're behaving unethically?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:52]** Absolutely not.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:53]** I am not.

**[01:05:53 - 01:06:03]** Just, I didn't realize that this procedure could... It hasn't happened before that they've had a bad reaction, no offense or God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:06]** So, that's all.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:13]** There's always a risk for how a subject might respond to these uncovered memories.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:18]** Now, this outcome is to be expected.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:28]** It's good that we were all in a room full of friends so that Orgot could, you know, snap out of that trauma and feel safe.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:29]** That's true.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:31]** That's true.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:33]** All right, look.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:33]** Yeah.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** What's up, Colin?

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:35]** Hang on.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:41]** I want to recognize the response you've just had.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:52]** And so I ask you, is there space for us to keep pressing into this memory?

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:56]** Or do we need to give you some time to process it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:02]** I think I'm going to need a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:10]** And you know that successive consecutive hypnotisms have pretty low chances of success.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:13]** They can't really be hypnotized again for a little bit of time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:19]** To metagame a bit, my intent was not to hypnotize again.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:21]** I just wanted to ask more questions about memory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:23]** Sure, okay.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:25]** Yeah, I just... Maybe let's...

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:28]** Let's avoid the first part.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:30]** Right.

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:30]** Yeah.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:33]** I can't go under again, but yeah.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:34]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:40]** You noticed the greys were talking to everyone in this room.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:42]** Yeah.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:44]** Were they asking us questions?

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:45]** What were they saying?

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:47]** What did it seem that they wanted?

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:49]** What's their motivation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:50]** It seemed...

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:58]** It just seemed conversational.

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:07]** I can't quite say anymore, but it seemed nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:12]** Who all was talking to the, like, communicating with the greys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:22]** Between Torv and other, all the other hypnotisms, it seems like at some point, everyone has talked to greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:31]** Oh, so it's not like, it's not like, it's not like Orgat saw Torv and Shay talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:57]** communicating with the great having a coffee and like uh it seems like they were all in separate small let's call them i don't know like uh like you would think of like interrogations sorry what what was that interrogation yeah but it seemed friendly so like but but that style of room and architecture seemed that way well it's only friendly because they're they're under some kind of control like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:58 - 01:09:00]** Assuming.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:03]** This is just the conspiracy theory coming out, but I don't trust Shay all of a sudden.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:11]** But now that you've clarified what Orgat saw, it's like, okay, maybe Shay... It's kind of like the Torv thing.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:16]** Last time you said Torv was walking with the Grey, and then it was like, wait, what do you mean walking with?

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:19]** I need a little more clarification on how he was walking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:22]** It seems like the Greys were talking to everybody.

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:29]** And they all seemed, as I said, to be under some sort of, yeah, like it's friendly spells or magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:35]** Are there any more questions, Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:38]** Or Dr. Ripke?

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:39]** That's it for me.

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:44]** I would encourage you to rest.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:46]** How does your head feel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:49]** It feels painful, to say the least.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:51 - 01:10:03]** you like plug that up for her yeah can i take a look and see if there's any relief i can give or yeah would you like something to relax i would like something to relax actually


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:07 - 01:10:12]** That single line is my greatest memory from episode one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:14]** Can I give you something to relax?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:18]** Do you have something to relax?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:18]** I would appreciate it.

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:21]** Can I give... Can I relax you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:10:22 - 01:10:23]** You could, sure.

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:26]** Yeah, you could let her borrow the relax you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:30]** You just stick... I'm sorry.

**[01:10:31 - 01:10:34]** You just stick a pain pill right into the hole.

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:34]** Oh, God.

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:34]** Jesus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:42]** Yeah, what do you do, Doctor?

**[01:10:43 - 01:10:49]** Yeah, so I'm going to massage your head a bit.

**[01:10:49 - 01:10:51]** And perhaps put a band-aid over this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:56]** We should be clear that Stalker is not a medical doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:59]** He is a scientist.

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:08]** The podcast does not have any medical training in a way that you should take as advice or legal advice for legal reasons.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:08]** It's a band-aid.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:09]** It's a melt-a-band.

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:11]** It's a band-aid.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:12]** It's a band-aid.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:15]** Shay gives it to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:19]** Then I give Orgat the beer to you for a minute.

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:22]** I'll help administer.

**[01:11:23 - 01:11:27]** Hopefully it'll help recharge your brain as much as possible.

**[01:11:27 - 01:11:30]** Thank you, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:31]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:35]** Look, we should... I'm gonna need it back, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:35]** Alright.

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:36]** It's fine.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:39]** Orgat, make sure to give that back to Doctor, okay?

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:41]** Don't take things like you took my stash of grenadine.

**[01:11:42 - 01:11:50]** All right, so... Hey, let's go hit Melt the Man, and then let's brief Narla on what's happening.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:55]** And if there's any update that Narla has, then she'll let us know then.

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:58]** Let's go up.

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:58]** All right.

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:00]** Shay walks out.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:04]** You can see Shay taps something on their data pad.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:06]** And...

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:09]** Man, I want to trust Shade so bad, but I don't.

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:12]** So I just, oh, I was talking like Orgat.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:16]** As you leave, by the way, Torv and Orgat seem to just sit.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:18]** The room seems quiet.

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:22]** I don't know who's leaving last, but you can just tell that there's a heaviness that's hanging in the air.

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:27]** And the sound of the relax you.

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:34]** I've sent... I've had Melted Man come out of my room on the main deck.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:38]** You leave the main deck and you see that... Oops.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:41]** You see that Melted Man is sitting.

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:44]** Rather, standing.

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:48]** Near all the chairs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:50]** All right.

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:51]** Hey.

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:52]** Hey, 2M.

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:53]** How you doing?

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:54]** Sorry.

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:57]** Can you just describe the scene again for us?

**[01:12:57 - 01:12:58]** So, like, we step out of the elevator.

**[01:12:58 - 01:13:00]** There are kind of chairs circled around.

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:03]** And I just see a bunch of doors.

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:05]** But it also looks like windows, possibly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:12]** You see that the lounge, there's a door to your left that has med bay on it.

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:16]** That is the door that's up in the northwest here.

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:25]** These are probably larger quarters, single resident quarters, probably for Narla, Shay, some of the more senior people.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:32]** There's an engine bay room that is over to the right.

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:45]** And there are not windows, but there are display screens that are lightly illuminating the soft blue running light hue that tends to run at night on the Void Crier.

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:48]** And in front of the, there's nothing on the displays.

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:50]** It's just, it's just like a flat tone.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:53]** No, I mean, there are, there are just some statistics.

**[01:13:53 - 01:14:02]** There's like some ads for different TV shows that are kind of, you know, that you can select as part of the hollow vids and see what's going on.

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:12]** And in the middle, where there are red lounge chairs and books on the western wall there, is Melt the Man standing.

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:19]** And Melt the Man looks cartoonish, but very wholesome in a way.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:24]** Red arms that are pretty short, kind of squat.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:33]** And there's a sense that they are moving very, I don't know, like they would if they were in a TV show, a Hollywood show.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:37]** Shay walks up.

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:47]** Hey, 2M, look, I'm going to need you to play back the last 24 hours.

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:47]** Hours.

**[01:14:48 - 01:14:49]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[01:14:49 - 01:14:50]** Hours.

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:51]** Hours.

**[01:14:51 - 01:14:51]** Hours.

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:53]** Hours.

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:54]** He calls him 2M.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:56]** It's just easier than calling him Ultimate.

**[01:14:59 - 01:14:59]** I can do that.

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:10]** And an arm comes out and shoots up a little hollow vid screen.

**[01:15:12 - 01:15:21]** You see that Melted Man is in Shay's room, and the lights are off.

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:27]** The camera has blinked to life, and there's a...

**[01:15:30 - 01:15:46]** And you see that Shay, where they were no longer, before it was just Melt and Man in the room, there's a whiteout of light, and then Shay is sitting on the bed.

**[01:15:49 - 01:15:51]** And Shay stands up.

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:54]** Who opened the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:56 - 01:15:57]** I'm sorry.

**[01:15:57 - 01:15:58]** Kelly was trapped.

**[01:15:58 - 01:15:59]** I had to rescue him.

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:01]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:01]** Thank you.

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:05]** We tried to do it over chat, but it failed.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:06]** I tried to sneak away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:07]** It's fine.

**[01:16:07 - 01:16:08]** You're so funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:11]** He literally walked his ass all the way back to the door to open it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:16:12 - 01:16:18]** You go down the elevator, I'm looking in the chat, and Kelly's saying, I'm trapped in this room still.

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:20]** Can you warp me to where you are, please?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:21]** Please.

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:23]** These guys are weird.

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:25]** I don't want to be in here anymore.

**[01:16:25 - 01:16:26]** Dude, it was awkward.

**[01:16:26 - 01:16:28]** Yeah, it was not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:16:28 - 01:16:29]** Were you still in the room?

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:33]** If you're watching, you see the map, and you just see Rick disappear.

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:34]** That's what happened.

**[01:16:34 - 01:16:37]** I went to the elevator, went down to the lower deck.

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:40]** And I just open the door and let him out.

**[01:16:40 - 01:16:42]** I'm sorry, where's the elevator?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:16:42 - 01:16:44]** Right in the middle, it's a circle.

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:46]** You just step on it, and then there's a little shield.

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:46]** You click the shield.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:52]** You click on the shield, and then you go to the main deck and click on the main deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:54]** Yes, all right.

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:54]** Oh, here's.

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:55]** Good to see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:57]** Hey, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:16:57 - 01:16:58]** Oh, hey, here's.

**[01:16:58 - 01:16:59]** All the training we had on phone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:00]** Good to see you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:17:00 - 01:17:00]** Here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:01]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:02]** Where were you?

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:03]** That was weird.

**[01:17:03 - 01:17:05]** Now we know who slept through the tutorial.


## Speaker_0

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:06]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:17:08 - 01:17:14]** You were just on your datapad the entire time that we were taking the tour, so I don't think you even knew where we were going.

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:16]** I was literally locked inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:17:16 - 01:17:25]** You were locked in the room with Orgot and Torb, who were sitting there quietly reviewing the changes in their bodily autonomy.

**[01:17:25 - 01:17:27]** Just, like, experienced all these memories.

**[01:17:27 - 01:17:31]** Just did their own thoughts, and here's just hanging out in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:17:33 - 01:17:43]** Everybody walking out of the room and shutting the door right before he gets there.

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:44]** He's reaching for the door.

**[01:17:44 - 01:17:49]** He turns around slowly and there's these two sitting on their beds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:49 - 01:17:53]** He's got pincers so he can't quite work the doorknob.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:59 - 01:18:05]** One of those round chicken metal ones that are impossible to touch when you don't have one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:13]** You go to ask Orgat, and Orgat says, eyes closed.

**[01:18:13 - 01:18:19]** Oh, it's so stupid, it's funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:20 - 01:18:21]** It's just a shirin in his monkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:22 - 01:18:29]** Oh my god, it's a shirin in his monkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:37]** Shay gets up from his bed in the hologram recording and walks out the door.

**[01:18:39 - 01:18:40]** Scrub back for me.

**[01:18:42 - 01:18:43]** Shay comes and rewinds.

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:45]** The whiteout comes through.

**[01:18:45 - 01:18:58]** And then it's just hour after hour going back in time with nothing happening from 23 hours back until I believe it's like 11.33 when the camera comes back on.

**[01:18:59 - 01:19:03]** So nothing happened until Shay came back.

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:05]** It's just blank.

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:09]** There's no memory recording there.

**[01:19:10 - 01:19:12]** Because if you recall, Bernice had the same thing.

**[01:19:12 - 01:19:17]** Bernice was hit, went down, came back up.

**[01:19:17 - 01:19:17]** Everyone was gone.

**[01:19:18 - 01:19:21]** And Bernice's memory was everyone coming back.

**[01:19:23 - 01:19:24]** That is all that I have.

**[01:19:26 - 01:19:27]** How did I do?

**[01:19:29 - 01:19:29]** Appreciate you.

**[01:19:29 - 01:19:30]** Thank you.

**[01:19:30 - 01:19:31]** You are welcome.

**[01:19:34 - 01:19:38]** Look, I think that's all we're going to get.

**[01:19:39 - 01:19:43]** We need to... It's been probably, what, maybe half an hour?

**[01:19:43 - 01:19:44]** 45 minutes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:45 - 01:19:46]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:19:47 - 01:19:51]** Let's go break the news to Gnarla.

**[01:19:51 - 01:19:52]** There's a lot to break.

**[01:19:57 - 01:19:58]** Milt, the man sits down in the chair.

**[01:19:59 - 01:20:02]** And Shay walks over to the elevator to head up to the bridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:04 - 01:20:04]** What are y'all doing?

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:07]** Working over to the elevator to go to the bridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:07 - 01:20:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:10]** Let's do it.

**[01:20:12 - 01:20:17]** Sorry, so MM's not, or 2M, Meltaman, whatever his name is, is not sentient?

**[01:20:17 - 01:20:20]** Like, we can't hypnotize him to find out more?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:20:20 - 01:20:23]** Well, I mean, would you hypnotize Bernice?

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:24]** They're a drone.

**[01:20:25 - 01:20:26]** I'm not saying they're not sentient.

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:30]** I'm just saying that it's a different level of information storing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:20:30 - 01:20:37]** It doesn't appear that they recorded hours of footage on this ship.

**[01:20:38 - 01:20:40]** I don't imagine the greys bothered Bernice.

**[01:20:42 - 01:20:47]** Other than to disable their faculties momentarily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:51]** Yeah, and I guess an EMP would have faulted them, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:20:51 - 01:20:53]** Yeah, that's what it seemed like happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:54]** That seems to be the rub.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:20:55 - 01:20:55]** EMP.

**[01:20:59 - 01:20:59]** So you come up.

**[01:21:00 - 01:21:03]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[01:21:03 - 01:21:03]** Let's move along.

**[01:21:04 - 01:21:07]** Yeah, it looks like Colin and Hears are standing on the same square, by the way.

**[01:21:08 - 01:21:11]** And maybe you all are just arm in arm.

**[01:21:11 - 01:21:12]** Get out of the way a little bit.

**[01:21:12 - 01:21:12]** No, it's fine.

**[01:21:12 - 01:21:13]** It's cool if you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:13 - 01:21:15]** I really like these people on the bridge.

**[01:21:15 - 01:21:16]** Colin's worried about Hears getting close to him.

**[01:21:17 - 01:21:18]** Yeah.

**[01:21:18 - 01:21:19]** I'm just holding on to Colin.

**[01:21:19 - 01:21:21]** Like, hold my hand.

**[01:21:21 - 01:21:21]** Yeah.

**[01:21:21 - 01:21:22]** He pulls me around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:21:22 - 01:21:24]** So you come up to the bridge.

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:29]** You see that the bridge is in a bit of a nighttime running mode.

**[01:21:29 - 01:21:40]** There is a blue light in the back, but everything at the actual stations themselves have an orange hue to them to provide better visibility kind of across different species.

**[01:21:40 - 01:21:48]** And so that's why there's this orange hue right here in front as Gnarla sits in the captain's seat with a hemispherical screen in front of them.

**[01:21:48 - 01:22:09]** fetch or sparkles the yosuke is with the cool mohawk is sitting on the right you have ezra sitting up front and you have sarza l sitting off to the left it's a smaller bridge it's probably like 20 by 25 feet kind of bullet shaped as you come up

**[01:22:11 - 01:22:13]** Fetch gives you a nod, smiles at you.

**[01:22:14 - 01:22:17]** Here's because here's if I remember right, you were like, hey, you're really cool.

**[01:22:18 - 01:22:21]** And then turns back to it.

**[01:22:21 - 01:22:22]** Narla looks over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:22 - 01:22:26]** So what did you all find out?

**[01:22:26 - 01:22:29]** What are these things that you have to share with me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:22:30 - 01:22:32]** Well, got a lot of things.

**[01:22:33 - 01:22:34]** Colin here.

**[01:22:34 - 01:22:40]** Really, all four of them have been very helpful in figuring out what's going on here.

**[01:22:40 - 01:22:42]** I think one of the biggest...

**[01:22:44 - 01:22:50]** One of the biggest pieces of information is that Colin has used a... I know you're going to laugh, Narla.

**[01:22:50 - 01:23:08]** Colin has used a hypnosis on myself, a few members of the Peritons, and we absolutely were abducted in those 24 hours.

**[01:23:08 - 01:23:08]** Hours.

**[01:23:09 - 01:23:10]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:23:11 - 01:23:12]** Dr. O'Keefe, do you say something?

**[01:23:12 - 01:23:17]** I would like to roll a sense motive on Narla as she responds.

**[01:23:17 - 01:23:17]** Sure.

**[01:23:17 - 01:23:18]** If she responds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:23:19 - 01:23:22]** Why don't I tell you her response and then you tell me whether you want to roll a sense motive on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:23:22 - 01:23:26]** And I'd like to roll a perception on just kind of everybody's response.

**[01:23:26 - 01:23:26]** Yeah.

**[01:23:26 - 01:23:27]** Or that more of a sense model.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:23:27 - 01:23:28]** I kind of want to see.

**[01:23:29 - 01:23:31]** Do you want to see what they're doing as they respond?

**[01:23:31 - 01:23:32]** Or do you want to understand why they're doing what they're doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:23:33 - 01:23:36]** I kind of want to look at their faces as they heard Shay say that.

**[01:23:36 - 01:23:37]** Ah, okay.

**[01:23:37 - 01:23:37]** Okay.

**[01:23:37 - 01:23:38]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:23:38 - 01:23:39]** Yeah.

**[01:23:39 - 01:23:42]** I think Rick is more observing for anything strange.

**[01:23:42 - 01:23:43]** Got it.

**[01:23:43 - 01:23:45]** I'm looking for tells.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:23:46 - 01:23:47]** You're looking for tells?

**[01:23:47 - 01:23:50]** Reading Mike Caro's book on poker tells.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:23:50 - 01:23:51]** Good book.

**[01:23:51 - 01:23:55]** What is your sense motive or perception, whichever one you're going to roll?

**[01:23:55 - 01:23:55]** I rolled a 14.

**[01:23:55 - 01:23:57]** 14, okay.

**[01:23:58 - 01:24:00]** For a total of... 17 for perception.

**[01:24:01 - 01:24:03]** Perception from Rick, 19.

**[01:24:03 - 01:24:03]** 23.

**[01:24:03 - 01:24:04]** 23 from Dr. O'Keefe.

**[01:24:05 - 01:24:12]** Fetch seems curious, similar to how Orgat was, turns.

**[01:24:13 - 01:24:15]** Ezra... Sorry?

**[01:24:15 - 01:24:16]** Poor Fetch.

**[01:24:19 - 01:24:28]** Ezra also turns around, but doesn't... You can tell from their body language, they don't seem that curious.

**[01:24:29 - 01:24:30]** And Sarza-El...

**[01:24:30 - 01:24:37]** is very curious and turns around and just starts to listen to Shay and watch the conversation.

**[01:24:38 - 01:24:39]** Gnarla just nods.

**[01:24:40 - 01:24:59]** Gnarla, you can tell, has gone from thinking that the crew was safe and now, as Shay is, needs to operate in a mode where they're understanding all threats or attacks to the Voidcrier and its crew.

**[01:25:01 - 01:25:04]** All right, so there is some concern.

**[01:25:04 - 01:25:08]** Thankfully, Dr. O.K.

**[01:25:08 - 01:25:15]** here has told me about something called a drift shadow projector.

**[01:25:15 - 01:25:16]** Is that right, Dr.

**[01:25:16 - 01:25:16]** O.K.


## Speaker_0

**[01:25:16 - 01:25:16]** ?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:25:17 - 01:25:29]** Yes, that could be one or part of many devices or things being employed to impair our progress.

**[01:25:30 - 01:25:47]** I'm told that the engines aren't working at all, but perhaps our progress was stunted and the feigning of our travel has been initiated by such a device.

**[01:25:49 - 01:26:03]** Would have to be, Ezra, if you could perhaps maybe scan passively, I don't know, or maybe impassively, to see if anything is within a few hexes of our ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:26:04 - 01:26:07]** That is a... That's a good question.

**[01:26:08 - 01:26:10]** Could you come show me, Dr.

**[01:26:10 - 01:26:14]** O.K., could you come point out where I should best target?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:26:15 - 01:26:15]** And, Dr.

**[01:26:15 - 01:26:19]** O.K., I'm going to have you give me a... That sounds suspicious.

**[01:26:19 - 01:26:21]** It seems pretty normal.

**[01:26:21 - 01:26:26]** I mean, not normal, but he's like, clearly you know what you're talking about, so he's like, hey, can you come help me?

**[01:26:26 - 01:26:28]** So I'm going to need you to give me a computer's check.

**[01:26:28 - 01:26:33]** While you're rolling that, I'll tell you that Gnarla seems... says...

**[01:26:33 - 01:26:35]** I agree.

**[01:26:35 - 01:26:36]** I think that's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:26:36 - 01:26:38]** I killed it with a 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:26:38 - 01:26:39]** 30 killer.

**[01:26:41 - 01:26:46]** So the thing is, we, our typical, why am I talking like Orgot?

**[01:26:46 - 01:26:52]** Our typical engines are working fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:26:52 - 01:26:59]** It's the drift engine that is preventing us, precluding us from making any progress further on our route.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:26:59 - 01:27:01]** Okay.

**[01:27:01 - 01:27:03]** This is good to know, Shay.

**[01:27:05 - 01:27:05]** Thank you.

**[01:27:07 - 01:27:22]** And Dr. Okay, you realize that Ezra is very competent, so you are thinking they're an equal, and I can talk to them on similar terms, right?

**[01:27:24 - 01:27:27]** You all start looking for unusual energy signatures.

**[01:27:29 - 01:27:40]** And because you got that drift travel projector and remembered that, you actually got a 32, so you succeed even more.

**[01:27:43 - 01:27:51]** There is some sort of vessel at the aft of the Void Crier.

**[01:27:53 - 01:27:54]** They're cloaked.

**[01:27:55 - 01:28:00]** So the resolution that you have on the exact point that they are, low.

**[01:28:01 - 01:28:11]** But you have now just narrowed it from anywhere in this 180 half of the sphere to in a much smaller quadrant.

**[01:28:12 - 01:28:14]** What do you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:28:14 - 01:28:15]** There is someone behind us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:28:19 - 01:28:19]** I knew it.

**[01:28:20 - 01:28:20]** I knew it.


## Speaker_0

**[01:28:21 - 01:28:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:28:22 - 01:28:24]** Shay, calm down.

**[01:28:25 - 01:28:26]** Where behind us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:28:26 - 01:28:28]** Maybe you... She takes a look.

**[01:28:29 - 01:28:33]** Yeah, I put a, you know, here's the anomalous reading.

**[01:28:33 - 01:28:34]** Okay.

**[01:28:34 - 01:28:36]** I've narrowed it down to this section.

**[01:28:36 - 01:28:38]** Okay.

**[01:28:38 - 01:28:38]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:28:38 - 01:28:44]** This is what I'm thinking.

**[01:28:46 - 01:28:50]** We can either choose to stay and fight...

**[01:28:51 - 01:28:54]** They have some sort of power over us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:28:54 - 01:29:09]** I think if we can get a burst of speed from perhaps our typical, our normal running engines to break us out of whatever you're saying, this has a range of very short range, the shadow projector.

**[01:29:09 - 01:29:11]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:29:11 - 01:29:11]** Yes.

**[01:29:11 - 01:29:11]** Okay.

**[01:29:12 - 01:29:13]** All right.

**[01:29:13 - 01:29:26]** I think if we can break out of that range, then maybe we can engage our drift engines and try and lose them or, worst case, take them on.

**[01:29:27 - 01:29:28]** I agree with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:29:30 - 01:29:31]** Okay.

**[01:29:31 - 01:29:32]** What weapons are we equipped with?

**[01:29:32 - 01:29:33]** We fought them before.

**[01:29:33 - 01:29:34]** It's not good.

**[01:29:34 - 01:29:35]** We should try to get away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:29:35 - 01:29:38]** We have killed at least one gray and a gray bounder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:29:39 - 01:29:41]** They might have bounders and bounders are not easy to fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:29:41 - 01:29:43]** That was in hand-to-hand combat.

**[01:29:44 - 01:29:48]** Need I remind you we are in the barrenness of the drift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:29:48 - 01:29:55]** I have reviewed the Starship operations manual, and I know that we can board them as needed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:29:57 - 01:29:59]** I vote strongly on that.

**[01:29:59 - 01:30:03]** That is both a Rick19 and a Kevin Decker thing to say.

**[01:30:04 - 01:30:05]** Absolutely.

**[01:30:05 - 01:30:06]** This is true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:30:06 - 01:30:10]** I'm a bit of a pilot.

**[01:30:10 - 01:30:13]** I can help out, although it looks like you have a full crew up here.

**[01:30:13 - 01:30:15]** We can try to get out of this mess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:30:15 - 01:30:35]** I just don't know that our weapon systems will be matched against that vessel, or even our maneuverability and speed, and to give away our intent and knowledge of... Right now, we have the advantage of surprise for our next action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:30:35 - 01:30:36]** Quick question.

**[01:30:37 - 01:30:39]** There's a large ship, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:30:41 - 01:30:45]** I'd say more of a medium, if I had to put a type classification to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:30:46 - 01:30:47]** A medium ship.

**[01:30:47 - 01:30:58]** Is there an advanced craft that we might use to transport from here to what we think might be sending that signal?

**[01:30:58 - 01:31:00]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:31:01 - 01:31:01]** We don't have it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:31:02 - 01:31:02]** No.

**[01:31:04 - 01:31:05]** We don't have an escape pod.

**[01:31:05 - 01:31:33]** i like your thinking but we don't have a skate pod i also like your thinking dr okay and i see that so are you saying that we should fire and try and take them out because we have no maneuverability now so my thought is that if we try and break out of whatever hold this device has on us then we can we at least have a shot to move around am i hearing what you were saying

**[01:31:34 - 01:31:46]** You do know that there's a heavy laser cannon, and there are other turret-linked heavy laser cannons here that are pretty substantial.

**[01:31:47 - 01:31:48]** It's pretty good maneuverability.

**[01:31:49 - 01:31:53]** Good both technically, mechanically, and—


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:31:53 - 01:31:55]** Wait, maneuverability like from the engines?

**[01:31:56 - 01:32:01]** Or like the craft itself has high maneuverability?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:32:02 - 01:32:03]** Yeah, it's called good.

**[01:32:03 - 01:32:06]** It's not perfect, but it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:32:06 - 01:32:07]** So it's a formidable ship.

**[01:32:07 - 01:32:10]** Sounds like we're set up for starship combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:32:10 - 01:32:14]** Yeah, the thing that we've never really done that much of.

**[01:32:15 - 01:32:15]** Didn't demo?

**[01:32:16 - 01:32:17]** I think we did one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:32:19 - 01:32:19]** All right.

**[01:32:20 - 01:32:24]** I think we use the element of surprise.

**[01:32:25 - 01:32:33]** Why don't we do a united front of a full-on assault as we try to break out of the 10 hex distance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:32:34 - 01:32:35]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:32:36 - 01:32:36]** Question.

**[01:32:37 - 01:32:39]** Before we go there.

**[01:32:41 - 01:32:41]** Mm-hmm.

**[01:32:41 - 01:32:46]** Narla, what memories do you have over the last 24 hours?

**[01:32:47 - 01:32:48]** That is a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:32:48 - 01:32:57]** I have no memories over the last 24 hours other than that I was watching the game and then Shay played this f***ing song over the speakers very loudly.

**[01:32:58 - 01:33:00]** That's the memory that I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:33:01 - 01:33:09]** On a scale from, say, 0 to 20, how strong would you say your will is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:33:13 - 01:33:15]** I have a pretty good will.


## Speaker_0

**[01:33:16 - 01:33:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:33:16 - 01:33:26]** If you're trying to butter me up, Colin, for this hypnosis, I would be amenable in most scenarios.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:33:26 - 01:33:31]** But given the precipice that we're at, I am very concerned about the safety of the crew.

**[01:33:31 - 01:33:37]** So maybe we can just put a pin in that and do it after we successfully get out of this situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:33:37 - 01:33:39]** I agree, but I disagree.

**[01:33:39 - 01:33:47]** I think your memories over the last 24 hours might serve you very well in trying to navigate out of this danger for all of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:33:48 - 01:33:54]** She is more concerned about the... Freaking out?

**[01:33:54 - 01:33:54]** Not freaking out.

**[01:33:55 - 01:33:57]** She is more concerned about the safety of everyone on board.

**[01:33:58 - 01:34:07]** With that said, I will let you roll a diplomacy check, but she is not in any mood to entertain, given that we're kind of at a readiness state to make a decision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:34:08 - 01:34:17]** I think Rick's going to try to assist in that, and he's going to say, Captain, understand that as of right now, your ship is not moving, and they don't expect anything from us.

**[01:34:18 - 01:34:24]** So taking some extra time to find out what happened to each of us is worth it.

**[01:34:24 - 01:34:26]** I'll assist on that.

**[01:34:26 - 01:34:26]** What is that again?

**[01:34:27 - 01:34:28]** A diplomacy check?

**[01:34:28 - 01:34:30]** I barely passed that.

**[01:34:30 - 01:34:35]** I got a seven on the die and I have a three for diplomacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:34:35 - 01:34:36]** I assist in diplomacy.

**[01:34:37 - 01:34:39]** What do your peers and Dr. Okay say?

**[01:34:41 - 01:34:54]** Dr. Okay says, right now we have time to collect our best wits and doing this might help us get some insight into how to defeat them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:34:55 - 01:35:00]** You have a very unique perspective as opposed to everyone else given your station.

**[01:35:00 - 01:35:03]** So if we can get that, it would be really helpful.

**[01:35:03 - 01:35:04]** We fought greys several times.

**[01:35:05 - 01:35:08]** We need every piece of information we can to pull this off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:35:09 - 01:35:14]** They have all kinds of technology we've never seen before that could translate to spacecraft too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:35:14 - 01:35:16]** So there's a plus six, right?

**[01:35:17 - 01:35:19]** From the three of you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:35:19 - 01:35:19]** Yeah.

**[01:35:19 - 01:35:20]** Yeah, I assisted.

**[01:35:22 - 01:35:27]** Unfortunately, it doesn't f***ing matter.

**[01:35:29 - 01:35:31]** I rolled a 3 on the die.

**[01:35:31 - 01:35:34]** So it's 9 plus what's your bonus?

**[01:35:35 - 01:35:36]** Hang on.

**[01:35:36 - 01:35:38]** 9 plus 8, so 17.

**[01:35:38 - 01:35:39]** 17.

**[01:35:39 - 01:35:46]** Not with how John described her hesitancy to... Yeah, I was looking for a little bit higher than that.

**[01:35:46 - 01:35:49]** Yeah, it needed to start with a 2 and probably a 3.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:35:50 - 01:35:51]** All right, let's try intimidation this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:35:52 - 01:35:57]** Class of Rick Routine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:35:57 - 01:35:58]** You're going to hypnotize.

**[01:35:58 - 01:36:00]** I mean, really?

**[01:36:00 - 01:36:01]** Hypnotize.

**[01:36:01 - 01:36:01]** Really?

**[01:36:01 - 01:36:02]** Follow the light.

**[01:36:03 - 01:36:03]** Follow the laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:36:04 - 01:36:04]** Relax.

**[01:36:04 - 01:36:05]** Focus on the barrel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:36:05 - 01:36:06]** Relax.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:36:07 - 01:36:31]** i love that like kevin just has a mode in the chamber which we're doing it we're killing him it's very very rick very rick so uh rick never does that of course except for now and the other times you did it yes yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:36:31 - 01:36:35]** Rick never does it.

**[01:36:35 - 01:36:37]** Except for the other times you did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:36:39 - 01:36:39]** All right.

**[01:36:39 - 01:36:41]** Look, I hear you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:36:43 - 01:36:45]** You have convinced me that this is important.

**[01:36:46 - 01:36:48]** We are going to prioritize this afterwards.

**[01:36:48 - 01:36:51]** I think this will be very instrumental.

**[01:36:52 - 01:36:53]** We can't do it now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:36:54 - 01:36:55]** I hope you understand.

**[01:36:55 - 01:36:59]** You are making a mistake, but it is your mistake to make.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:36:59 - 01:37:00]** It's not the first time I've heard that.

**[01:37:01 - 01:37:02]** It's only our lives on the balance.

**[01:37:04 - 01:37:09]** Right now, I have to trust in the experience and knowledge that I have, but I'm very grateful to have the four of you here.

**[01:37:09 - 01:37:10]** Now.

**[01:37:10 - 01:37:13]** Obviously, the four of you know how to handle yourselves.

**[01:37:13 - 01:37:14]** You've also handled greys.

**[01:37:14 - 01:37:23]** So I'm going to buck protocol, which says that guests aboard might not have too much autonomy on the ship when it comes to the operation.

**[01:37:24 - 01:37:27]** So I would typically request you to stay in your rooms.

**[01:37:27 - 01:37:28]** Why am I talking like Shay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:37:30 - 01:37:32]** We're going to need your help.

**[01:37:33 - 01:37:41]** I will need probably one of you to support the magic officer, who is Orgat.

**[01:37:42 - 01:37:46]** One of you will need to, I think, support as a science officer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:37:46 - 01:37:49]** I will need one of you to help in engineering.

**[01:37:49 - 01:37:56]** And I will need one person to be available to do any of those three or more at any time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:37:58 - 01:37:58]** Who wants what?

**[01:37:58 - 01:38:00]** I can do mysticism and engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:38:03 - 01:38:06]** Yeah, I can do engineering and science.

**[01:38:06 - 01:38:07]** I can help with your magic guy.

**[01:38:08 - 01:38:08]** All right.

**[01:38:08 - 01:38:09]** That shouldn't be a problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:38:10 - 01:38:11]** There's no turret available?

**[01:38:11 - 01:38:11]** Come on.

**[01:38:11 - 01:38:18]** There is a turret available if you want to help with the gunner and take some pressure off of anybody else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:38:18 - 01:38:44]** rick just wants to shoot some dude yeah the metagaming mysticism is my highest skill what is it i have mysticism uh plus what plus 15 oh yeah it's higher than mine then yeah uh i have no engineering check at all i have a four on that uh i have 13 engineering yeah i'm only good for shooting things naturally


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:38:44 - 01:38:50]** And I also have science, life science 15, physical science 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:38:52 - 01:38:54]** I've been spreading around my points too much.

**[01:38:54 - 01:38:56]** I need to like, you know, double down on my bigger skills.

**[01:38:56 - 01:39:00]** But anyway, I have plus 10 Mississippi engineering plus 30 computers.

**[01:39:00 - 01:39:05]** So I can help out a little bit with, I'll be the generalist, I guess.

**[01:39:06 - 01:39:06]** All right.

**[01:39:07 - 01:39:08]** Cheers.

**[01:39:08 - 01:39:08]** I'll be the generalist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:39:09 - 01:39:09]** Okay.

**[01:39:10 - 01:39:11]** Yeah.

**[01:39:11 - 01:39:14]** And Rick 19, you're helping with the guns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:39:14 - 01:39:17]** That is my most proficient position.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:39:17 - 01:39:18]** All right.

**[01:39:18 - 01:39:18]** And Dr.

**[01:39:18 - 01:39:19]** O.K.?

**[01:39:19 - 01:39:21]** I'll be your science officer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:39:22 - 01:39:22]** All right.

**[01:39:23 - 01:39:23]** And Colin?

**[01:39:25 - 01:39:28]** I've got your mysticism right here.

**[01:39:28 - 01:39:28]** All right.

**[01:39:29 - 01:39:29]** He grabs his junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:39:32 - 01:39:33]** Right here for you.

**[01:39:34 - 01:39:35]** Just a man and his monkey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:39:37 - 01:39:44]** Just a man and his monkey.

**[01:39:44 - 01:39:45]** That was the correct message.

**[01:39:45 - 01:39:45]** There it is.

**[01:39:45 - 01:39:46]** Now it gets to be the title.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:39:47 - 01:39:51]** Gnarla hits a switch on the captain's chair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:39:53 - 01:39:54]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:39:54 - 01:39:54]** Oh, okay.

**[01:39:54 - 01:39:57]** There's a all call.

**[01:39:58 - 01:39:59]** To all crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:40:00 - 01:40:04]** We are in an unusual, singular situation.

**[01:40:05 - 01:40:09]** There is a threat to the Voidcrier from without.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:40:11 - 01:40:18]** And also, considering the events of the past 24 hours, potentially within.

**[01:40:18 - 01:40:20]** We don't know what we're dealing with.

**[01:40:21 - 01:40:25]** Other than that, we're dealing with those f***ing filthy gray pricks again.

**[01:40:26 - 01:40:29]** So I need all of you to be on your highest guard.

**[01:40:31 - 01:40:38]** And whatever loss of time stunt this was, assume that they are capable of anything.

**[01:40:39 - 01:40:45]** If you see anything mysterious, do not hesitate to kill.

**[01:40:47 - 01:40:52]** Now that goes for outside the ship and in if you see one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:40:52 - 01:40:53]** No, we won't hesitate.

**[01:40:53 - 01:40:55]** He looks over at Rick suspiciously.

**[01:40:56 - 01:40:58]** And also proudly, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:40:58 - 01:41:00]** Very proud.

**[01:41:00 - 01:41:01]** Turns it off.

**[01:41:04 - 01:41:04]** Is everyone ready?

**[01:41:05 - 01:41:06]** Narla looks around the room.

**[01:41:06 - 01:41:08]** We're going to do as you say, Dr. O'Kay.

**[01:41:09 - 01:41:10]** She opens up a comm.

**[01:41:10 - 01:41:15]** Orvir, I'm going to need you to aim fire at this sector here.

**[01:41:17 - 01:41:18]** Looks at Ezra, who nods.

**[01:41:19 - 01:41:20]** Sends some information.

**[01:41:20 - 01:41:25]** And then Hesper, I know that you are still working on the drift drive.

**[01:41:25 - 01:41:27]** We are going to use the typical engines here.

**[01:41:27 - 01:41:32]** So both you said here's you have some experience.

**[01:41:32 - 01:41:37]** You will be helping out Fetch just to make sure that we can get out of this maneuver.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:41:37 - 01:41:39]** I can help with pretty much anything you need.

**[01:41:39 - 01:41:40]** I'm here for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:41:41 - 01:41:42]** That would be real great.

**[01:41:42 - 01:41:43]** I would love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:41:43 - 01:41:44]** Fetch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:41:44 - 01:41:45]** Looks at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:41:45 - 01:41:47]** All right, come on over.

**[01:41:47 - 01:41:48]** Let's get this done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:41:48 - 01:41:50]** All right, let's do it.

**[01:41:50 - 01:41:50]** Nardla.

**[01:41:52 - 01:41:52]** Looks at all of you.

**[01:41:54 - 01:41:55]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:41:58 - 01:41:58]** Zero!

**[01:42:00 - 01:42:00]** Zero!

**[01:42:03 - 01:42:04]** Leroy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:42:06 - 01:42:15]** One of the outer bay doors opens, and you see a single guy floating towards you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:42:15 - 01:42:17]** Is the doctor okay?

**[01:42:17 - 01:42:17]** Is he shooting?

**[01:42:19 - 01:42:26]** Amazing use of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:42:26 - 01:42:27]** Gnarla says, Here we go.

**[01:42:29 - 01:42:31]** Engage.

**[01:42:34 - 01:42:49]** And Ezra and Shaze and Fetches and Sarzael's voice begin to join in this chorus, modulating until they all come together in unison at this.

**[01:42:50 - 01:43:04]** at one particular frequency and then Shay and Narla slump in their chairs while Ezra, Sparkles, and Sarzel stand up and look at you and Fetch looks at you here and then Dr. O.K.

**[01:43:05 - 01:43:11]** and looks at Shay and Narla unconscious, begins to smile and starts... Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:43:11 - 01:43:12]** You were right.

**[01:43:12 - 01:43:15]** You cannot stop yourselves.

**[01:43:15 - 01:43:17]** You deserve this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:43:17 - 01:43:19]** And her hands begin to glow red.

**[01:43:20 - 01:43:23]** And that's our game.

**[01:43:24 - 01:43:25]** Oh my goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:43:25 - 01:43:27]** The third fold has begun.

**[01:43:32 - 01:43:33]** Screw you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:43:33 - 01:43:36]** I was looking forward to Starship Combat.

**[01:43:36 - 01:43:37]** F*** you.


## Speaker_0

**[01:43:37 - 01:43:37]** F*** you.
