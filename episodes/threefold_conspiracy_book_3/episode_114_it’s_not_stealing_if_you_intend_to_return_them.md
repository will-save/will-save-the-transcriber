## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:25]** We'll save!

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** We'll save!

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:28]** We'll save!

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:30]** That was just the energy I wanted to come in with.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:30]** Now.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** Save!

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:33]** Bring it back down.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:34]** Kelly!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:36]** You have a question.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:36]** From Zelda.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** Okay, so... Hey!

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** Hey!

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:39]** Listen!

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:47]** So listen, so like in the last episode, I think it was there was like one random moment or there might have been a reason.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** I can't remember whether it was a poignant moment or not.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:55]** But then you just played like some audio was like, like some like, you know what I'm talking about?

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** There must have been a reason for that.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:58]** Somewhere smack that in the middle of the episode.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** I'm going to find it.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** I'm going to, like, show you it.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:06]** You added, like, or whoever did the audio added some weird thing that was obviously meant to be weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:09]** Wait, is this a... You went back and listened to an episode?

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** Or are you talking about in the last episode?

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:13]** Was there, like, a rooster crowing outside?

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:13]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** Yeah.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:39]** it's a published episode it was an episode or two ago and it's for sure was like music or something or whatever okay so this is definitely like a jingle yeah yeah it was that's what you think like i'm pretty sure and it seemed like it was there on purpose as if it were a clue do you does that ring a bell sean dude john insert audio clues you know what i'm saying i feel like you might do that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:39 - 00:03:01]** something important is actually just every episode i read the final thing that i'm going to say that reveals everything and then i put it backwards and i put it really low in the track and it just plays backwards so you have to play the episode backwards and speed it up i will and that's how and it's the third word from every episode for the last


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:25]** 113 episodes yeah that's it that's it that reveals it actually it was the graze all along it follows the fibonacci sequence really so it's like the first word then the third word then the fifth word that's it that's it that's it i wouldn't be surprised to get on that and then if you divide that word by phi then you'll be


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:27]** We need to get 4chan to investigate.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** That's what we need to do.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** 4chan, investigate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:33]** You have given me ideas, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:36]** I'll post it for everyone to observe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:42]** This is a dangerous path in which we now tread.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:46]** Speaking of paths, Will, where are you?

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:49]** Where in the world is Will today?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:52]** Where in the world is Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:56]** Garrett Diego.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:56]** Nailed it.

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:04]** I am in the beautiful, lush, green state of Hawaii.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Oh, nice.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:05]** Amazing.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Amazing.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Nice.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** Yeah.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:08]** That's awesome.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:18]** There was a tsunami warning that I did not test, that I did not know about today during one of my meetings, and I almost shit my pants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** Get to the high ground.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** I'm next to the beach.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:29]** There was some volcanic activity, but it was only a test.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** Okay, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** We said you're on Kauai?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:32]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:35]** The active volcano is Kona, right?

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** The main island, the big island.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:42]** Just a fun fact for anybody who doesn't know this is that Hawaii is in the middle of a tectonic plate.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:48]** And so the formation of Hawaii is actually because there's a hole in that plate where the lava is flowing up to create the islands.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:53]** And so you can track the flow, the movement of that plate by the shape of Hawaii.

**[00:04:54 - 00:05:00]** So Kona is the current location and the smaller the islands are, they're the older islands that are further off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** That was the first island.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:03]** Of which Kauai is the oldest island.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:27]** oh that's awesome geologically speaking this you are on old ground but is is that when it was patented or when it got to market i think it came to market pretty pretty long ago about uh yeah 12 billion years or so will where were you when it came to market that's what i want to know

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:31]** Uh, I was elsewhere because, I mean, Earth was boring back then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:36]** Yeah, I want to know, when was the first time you visited Hawaii?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** Um...

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** It was before Cook.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:48]** And I was trading metal goods with the indigenous people long before him.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:55]** And they were like, well, we don't get much supply of it here, so we'll take it.

**[00:05:55 - 00:06:00]** But, you know, obviously people have brought finer things for weapons and things.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** Sure, sure.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:03]** That's smart.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** That's smart.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:04]** Yeah.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:30]** yeah it's very cool one of my neighbors is actually like a descendant of the doll family wow like fruit yeah like doll pineapples yeah she she grew up in hawaii her family is his doll yeah wow that's cool that's cool wow nice why why'd you come to maryland yeah of all i could think of a few reasons i'll leave them for another podcast


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** For Will's other podcast.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** I forgot that you're on it.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:38]** Hey, I thought we could do something fun that we haven't done in a while, real quick.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:41]** We could do quick two rounds of... What's that game that we played, Vinny?

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:42]** The other day?

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:45]** Third Thought.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** Third Thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** Should we just do a quick two round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** I need clarification, though, before you explain it.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:55]** The first thought is the previous third thought?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:55 - 00:07:23]** or do you need three thoughts after so it's technically second yeah three becomes one okay the first one is three so for those who've never played third thought you get a group of people together it's a good improv warm-up that's the hardest part it's just getting people together right that is it absolutely the hardest part um so someone kicks us off i guess i'll kick us off um they have a thought and then that leads them to their second thought which leads them to their third thought

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** And then it passes to the next person.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** That third thought is the next person's first thought.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:31]** And then that leads them to a second, leads them to a third.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:34]** And then the baton is passed all around the circle.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:43]** So since we're virtual and we'll go me, Will, Kelly, John, Kev, back to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** So Benny, Will, Kelly.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:46]** Me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** You just have to remember the person before you.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** So if my person was John, you just have to remember John.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** So if John's done, it's my turn.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** Okay.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** Got it.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** So does everybody know who they're following?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:00]** Can you give us an example of three thoughts, Vinny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:03]** So, for example, I'll give you an example to start the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:04]** Are we doing an example?

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:05]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:06]** Let's just start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** All right, fine.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** We'll just start.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** Fine.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** We know what we're doing.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** We're professional.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:17]** Dole Fruit leads me to Bob Dole, who leads me to Bill Clinton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:18]** Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:28]** Bill Clinton leads me to Monica Lewinsky, which leads me to a blue dress.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:29]** What?


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:40]** A blue dress leads me to that, like, blue and white dress conundrum on the internet meme situation, which leads me to, uh, uh, okay.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:44]** Oh, which leads me to, like, the doge dog that, like, died, unfortunately.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** Aw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:45 - 00:09:03]** yeah yeah the doge dog that died leads me oh yeah leads me to that that one dog that would go to its owner's grave every day right which then also leads me to coffins you're welcome kev


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:04]** Ouch!

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:10]** Okay, so like, all of that, every last bit of that reminds me of my dog, who's gone now.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** No!

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:13]** Which just makes me sad.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:24]** But that does bring me, that makes me think about my house, which I'm very happy to be in, and that makes me think of my children, and I love my children very much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:33]** Kev's children make me think of not being able to walk, and

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:40]** Not being able to walk leads me to being very drunk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:46]** Being very drunk, I'm reminded of my invention of alcohol.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:55]** The invention of alcohol reminds me of making friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:00]** Making friends reminds me of all of you people.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:05]** And all of you people reminds me of the willing who listen to us talk.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:08]** And I love you guys.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** The ones that I talk to anyway.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:09]** I don't know about the rest of you.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:10]** But I'm sure you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:13]** I don't know.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:13]** Talk to us.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:31]** The willing that Kelly don't talk to reminds me of all the countries that we diss and all the countries that we diss makes me think about my wedding, which was a great time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:39]** John's wedding makes me think of archery and archery makes me think of hunting.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:40]** That was it.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** That's it.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** That's twice around the horn.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** That was twice around the horn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** That felt good.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** I felt like I exercised my brain.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** That was nice.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** Kev, I'm sorry that we led you into such a deep, dark place.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:50]** Ouch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:51]** We laughed.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** We cried.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** We made friends.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:54]** We celebrated.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** We celebrated.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** Bob Dole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:59]** He's the reason Bodhi's gone.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:02]** Wow.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Wow.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:03]** That calculus.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** That's what I got out of this whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:15]** Also, did you hear that the guy who did the meme about the blue gold dress or the blue white dress killed his wife or something like that?

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:15]** What?

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:20]** I could be spreading lies, but I'm just saying.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:20]** Man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:24]** This is a bad opening.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** Is the conspiracy getting to us?

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:27]** Is that what's happening right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** We left on a fairly high note last time.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:31]** I mean, we found, like, a magic sword.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** So, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:37]** So, like, we thought the NanoVenture was, you know, to flesh out some of the backstory.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:43]** Was it really just, like, a mental health break from this, like, traumatic kidnapping story?

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:43]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:53]** Man who shot to global fame after his mother-in-law wore the dress, which broke the internet, to his wedding, is accused of attempting murder...

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** of his wife.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:55 - 00:12:01]** Attempting murder of his wife leads me to murder weapons, which leads me to lawn sorts.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** So let's play.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** Now we're going to play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:06]** He's also Scottish, so it brings it all back around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:11]** I thought we were going there the whole time.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** We were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:18]** Before we go any further, the dress always reminds me of the Yanny Laurel thing.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** I only ever hear Laurel.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** My son swears he hears both.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** My wife swears she only hears Yanny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:28]** If I prep myself, I can hear either.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:34]** So if I go unconsciously... I thought you said neither.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** I hear nothing.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** I can hear back and forth too.

**[00:12:38 - 00:13:07]** let's let's play let's get back into this conspiracy let's not rest on our yannies sorry I don't want to rest on my laurels ever last time Kev decided not to join in the fun and sneak around with here's and he didn't want to get a murder bot weapon he didn't want to get a murder bot weapon yeah it's rough


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** But Dr. O.K.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:12]** would like Hears to pick up him a cool relic.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** Something.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** Cool relic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:20]** You all start to investigate T'Challa's base.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** You start moving down the hallway.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** Hears becomes invisible.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:30]** Kaniko has a pretty stealthy...

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:33]** And you're tracing.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** There's a moment.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** You have to decide what to do next.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:43]** Do you go look into the garage or do you follow this feeling that pretty much everyone felt except for here's?

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:47]** And you're like, all right, well, you know what?

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:49]** We are also here to explore, to figure out.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:53]** Because things aren't right in Dodge.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:57]** And we're determining how fast we need to get out of Dodge.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:08]** So you clear this open area where you can see that there's a glass partition that leads into some sort of command center HQ.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** You pass by it.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:10]** There's a door.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** You open the door.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:32]** And weirdly, it's like the entire structure of Tyrkala's base changes from the metal, austere, militaristic compound that you're in to an anachronistic wood building.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:37]** It's like you just walked in off the streets of Absalom.


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:38 - 00:15:03]** into a bar yeah kelly well i was gonna say since i saw it it reminds me this group of people minus uh sorry benny we all played um um knives all knives over phandalin phandelver i can't tell what the name is yeah that yeah yeah yeah and then they reminded me of the tavern that we were it looked straight it brought me straight back we're not playing the memory game anymore kelly


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** What?

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** What are you talking about?

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** We're done with that.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** The third thought, it reminds me.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** Sorry.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** Okay, okay.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:09]** All right.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** That was good.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:10]** That was good.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** That was good.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:12]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:23]** You're thinking maybe we're going to explore, and then you hear these voices, again, in a language that you don't know, Kelly, and Keniko didn't know, and you're like, oh.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:26]** Keniko shuts the door, walk around the corner.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** You wait for a second.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:27]** You don't hear anything.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:36]** As you're around the corner trying to hide, you do pass a door that says Inspector Jock's Herds, probably Jock's Herds Quarters.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:41]** And then you back up into the door to a chapel.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** You're going to unlock the chapel.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:46]** You see that there's only one biometric signature that's allowed to unlock it.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:48]** That is Inspector Jock's Herds.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:50]** You crack it.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** You get in.

**[00:15:52 - 00:16:01]** There's the taste of warm, stale air in a room that the power has been cut to.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** There's no power here.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** But there's a glow in the corner.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:11]** Kaniko sees it, brings her attention to it, hears it.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** This glow is coming from a niche.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:17]** And each of these niches is a different god.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:22]** Demortosh, Desna, Hylax, Purasma, Yomide, Sarenrae.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** The list goes on.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:29]** And Yomide's niche is where her idol would be.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** It looks like it's been draped with cloth.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:41]** After some mysticism and some checks and some unsure, some uncertainty...

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** She pulls off the cloth.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:57]** And the four of you, including Kaniko, who felt that wave earlier of a resonance in your soul that something good needs to happen, feel the relief come over you as the cloth has been lifted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** Can you clarify something real quick?

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:02]** You're saying that all of us felt something except for Hears.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** Was that a role that we did?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** WTF?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** WTF?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** Could be related to his antenna.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:14]** I don't know why that happened.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** That is pretty weird.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:19]** Especially considering how in tune he is with mysticism.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** There must be some weird reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:25]** Okay, that's what I'm getting at, Kelly.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** It's a weird reason.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** Okay, what's the reason?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:29]** I was just commenting and agreeing with you.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:31]** Are you suspecting me of something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** Is that what you're doing right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** Is this really what you're doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:33]** Should I?

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:38]** Now you're running off alone with Kaniko after Colin tried to... I invited you.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:38]** You were invited.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:41]** Colin thought he was in love, and now you're running off with this girl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:46]** If you feel so strongly about it, you should... Thought?

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Go check on her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:47]** Thanks.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** Thanks.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:48]** Currently, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:59]** Okay, first of all, Rick is not trying to... He wants Colin to... Yeah, he's not going to swoop in and try to take this from Colin, eh?

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:03]** B, he's not some kind of traitor, all right?

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** He's proven himself to you.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** Don't suspect yours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** Okay, all right.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:11]** I do find it weird that he's calling you out saying that you're the only one not to feel it.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** It is weird.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:13]** We don't know why.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:16]** I also don't know why.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** I said we.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** You were included in the we.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:26]** Um, also pointing to the schematics, just in case anybody has fallen along and whoever's sharing screen, uh, wants to bring that up.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:35]** Uh, we are now talking about the, the, the three of us, Colin, Rick and Dr. Okay.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:41]** Are in the warehouse, which is the like second largest square kind of the bottom, right?

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:49]** And then that hallway... So now where Hears and Kaniko are, they went up to the training room.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** It's the triangle pointing to the top.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:52]** They went down the hallway.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:57]** The other triangle was the one pointing to Inspector Heard's room.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:04]** And then up that hallway, again, if you're looking at Herd's door, make a left, and that would be the area where the chapel is.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:09]** So on the map, you guys are in the farthest northeast room.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:10]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** Okay.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** Indeed.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:21]** You pull off the cloth, and there is the striking, charismatic, honorable...

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:51]** figure of Yomide wielding a real longsword that's like beautifully crafted on the longsword it says for victory for the heart and that's where we ended here as you were reaching over to grab it that's actually where we ended sorry

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** You reach over to grab it.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:56]** You pick it up.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:58]** It feels heavy in your hand.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:08]** But you're able to slowly lift it out with care and make sure it doesn't clang against the confines of the niche where it's been so carefully housed.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:10]** And you take it.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:13]** You lay it in your sharing hands.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:13]** You look at it.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:16]** And it's beautiful.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:22]** You immediately, as you touch it, get this sense here that

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:28]** The reason why you didn't feel this is because I believe you worship as Mara, right?

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** And you're the pirate.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:36]** And so while you have...

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:40]** You lean towards a goodness in the world.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:42]** There's a pirate in you.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:43]** And that's okay.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:50]** And the sword, the meaning, the religion of the sword doesn't resonate with who you are as a character.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** There's nothing bad for you.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:56]** But the reason is that you feel like this is not quite for you.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:56]** Right?

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:58]** You can still use it.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:01]** But it's not quite intended for you.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** Just kidding.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Yeah.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** Yeah, I got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** You're a bad guy.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:07]** No, I'm not saying you're a bad guy.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** This is a good sword and you're a bad guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:11]** That's literally what he did not say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:17]** And the glow seems to kind of fade away.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** As if it was being called.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:23]** And that light that was in the corner there seems to go out.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** Now... Go ahead.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** I was going to say if you could talk to it or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:31]** I know sometimes you seem to have a little conscience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** No.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** You don't feel like anything.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:45]** But there is a... In the same way that the four others felt like a wave of kind of gratitude, as you handle it, you do feel a sort of sense of relief fleeting.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** Like, ah, this is nice.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:53]** Reminder that it's 6.30, and you know that there's a shift change around 7.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:58]** You are in a room where there could be, where the power's been cut.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** Cameras?

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** No, the power's been cut.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:06]** And, you know, you haven't explored the rest of the room, I'd say.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:08]** You've mostly been focused on this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:09]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:09]** Yeah.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:16]** Might I suggest taking a gander at those other items?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:16]** Idols.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:26]** Here's does agree, and he kind of walks around the room counterclockwise, hitting up each sort of miniature shrine as he does.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** Okay.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:29]** I'll say that... Does he see anything as he does?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:29]** Yeah.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:30]** I'll say this.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** You...

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:49]** we'll look later at what kind of the sword is because i think the realization too that you need to get a move on right and the time to really like go into the sword and try and understand what it is we can we can get to it that later you walk around the corner

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:55]** But the next idol and the next idol, you go to Demoratash.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:55]** Nothing.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:59]** You go through Triune.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:00]** Nothing.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:04]** You go to Hylaks.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:04]** Sure.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:06]** Nothing.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:11]** You go to Waden.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** And there is a Starstone Compass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** Okay.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:16]** Okay.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** What's that?

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** Can I look it up?

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** Star stone.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:26]** Yeah, I am taking it, by the way, but I just want to see where the star stone comes from.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:37]** Small clockwork navigational device hones in on mystic signals emitted by a star stone calculating the compasses.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** Oh, that could be useful.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** It shows you the way.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:42]** Precise distance from and direction relative to the internet.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** While you're in the core system.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:50]** This device will let you automatically know which direction central station is in relation to your current location.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:53]** And it gives you two plus insight bonus to piloting checks when astrogating through the core system.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** Yeah, here's going to take that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:01]** You do notice that it doesn't look... Everything else feels like it's been here for a while.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:03]** That one doesn't.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:06]** It's weird.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:09]** You go over to Phrasma.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** The niche of Phrasma.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:15]** You find a hailstorm class zero knife.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:19]** God, we're going to get so much loot, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:21]** Right, because none of this is going to backfire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** Also, I'm totally going to tell you all about this.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:25]** What is it called again?

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:26]** Hailstone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:28]** A hailstorm class zero knife.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** It's a zero knife hailstorm class.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** It's pretty sweet.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** Give me a mysticism check.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** Here's.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** All right, cool.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:40]** So... 19.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:40]** 19.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:44]** You know that this is the favorite weapon for, for asthma.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** Canico walks up.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:47]** Only Rick was here.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:50]** He could, you know, have fun with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:50]** Yeah.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** Sorry.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** Yeah.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** Can you go?

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:52]** No, no, no.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** Uh, I was just thinking about Rick and how you would like it.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:55]** Probably.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:57]** Hmm.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:57]** What's up?

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** Can you go?

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** He chose not to come.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:01]** What's up, Kanika?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:04]** Have you ever seen anything like this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** She's standing at the dais.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:09]** You can't quite see what she's pointing to.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** There's like the little lip on the dais.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:13]** So, you know, like there can be things on it.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** People don't see what's there.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** It's angled.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** There's a little lip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** Have you ever seen anything like this before?


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:22]** What is... Hears walks up to it.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** It's... What does he see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:30]** A very, very, very old book.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:35]** Imagine if you had taken a book from the...

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:52]** training room that world oh yeah and you would put it here it's like it's like going right now to find the lost city of the like library of alexandria and finding like scrolls on like papyrus it's like it is way

**[00:25:53 - 00:26:21]** thousands of years seems like wow it looks ancient uh can i wonder if i can read it yeah it's in common but it's in so much like it's it's like reading old english it's a little it's just it's just language has developed since then right does it go oh does it go all the way back to before the gap you don't quite know that now but seems like it's seems like it's very old could be pre-gap


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:26]** I wonder what topics it covers.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** Let me see if I can discern that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:35]** You slowly start peeling through these withered, tired pages.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:39]** Pages that people have read over and over again.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:45]** Handwriting that people seem to write eons ago.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** You're flipping through.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:56]** It seems like it's a... They're descriptions of someone's life.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:00]** They're descriptions of, like, goals.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:08]** You flip through to some chapters and, like, they're, like, drawings that look like Da Vinci's drawings.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:15]** And there's, like, prescriptions written out that look like they would be on, like, early medicine books.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:27]** And then there's like some basic engineering that you're like, well, this is pretty advanced for what I would think at the time, but not like now I could do this in my sleep, but at the same time, like, this is pretty incredible.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:35]** There are these ideas, these lofty goals about advice, about how to act, how to behave.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:42]** And then you start flipping through and you realize that there's an author here.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** There's a tone in the words.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:48]** Again, you're getting this pretty quickly because you're just flipping through.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:58]** But it seems like as you flip to the front, you see that this is a book written by somebody named Erodin.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:05]** And the book is called The History and Future of Humanity.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:12]** Before people look it up and Google it and stuff, do you want to give me a mysticism check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** Yes.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** I'm not Googling things.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** I'm taking notes.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:18]** 20.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:18]** 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:27]** Aroden is a nearly forgotten god.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:33]** One of the ascended gods.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:42]** One of the people who have, in the time of Galarian, you might remember, you think, yeah, there was something where you could like...

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:46]** Like, you could achieve godhood by not being born as a god.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:50]** If you pass these tests, then you could achieve godhood.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** And there were only three people that had.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** Four, I guess.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:57]** And the only way that you did it was by touching the star stone.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:04]** And so, you realize that, oh, Erodin is the person who, like...

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:26]** created a new age in galarian they are the person who brought the star stone from the depths of the ocean to absalom to the city of absalom and put it in the star stone cathedral eridan is a major figure and like this is stuff that you might have learned at like it's like chapter one

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:29]** in all the religious studies books.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:47]** You know, it's like maybe there's a class about the religions of the lost planet of Golarion, and scholars have pieced together from findings and dig sites, and there are all these theories about what it might mean, and you recall Aroden being one of the central figures in this.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** I think Will, you had a question, or Kelly, you had a question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:55]** I was just hearing you relay this.

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:09]** I wonder if this chapel represents some sort of shrine or perhaps a means of ascending.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:24]** Yeah, so that everyone knows, this book here is, and some of the things that are in here are used or have been allegedly used as a path to godhood.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:28]** It's sort of like, perhaps someone's trying to achieve apotheosis here.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:31]** Maybe that tall, lanky guy that I keep forgetting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** Inspector Heard?

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:32]** Inspector Heard.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:35]** The book is not about how to ascend to godhood.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** The book is about... It's just his diaries.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:52]** The book is about... It's kind of really a collection of a lot of things, like how humanity should act, what has happened, Eridan's thoughts, all these ideas about medicine and engineering.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:56]** The whole godhood thing is really... That's how Eridan became a god, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:02]** But you have the Starstone, too, which helps in that process, correct?

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:02]** Sorry?

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:31]** you did touch it you were saying earlier am i not right and i might have missed the compass but like you might be like putting together things that aren't there is what john's telling you i'm not necessarily saying that i know i know that it's clear like the book is not talking about how he touched the star stone i'm saying that that i know what john's trying to tell me i'm just saying that like but but but but i thought you mentioned that the star stone was a was like one thing that he had to touch or do or whatever and like interact with some way to become a god i might be


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** Yeah, there are only like four people who did it.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:38]** I think it's Eredin, Yomide, who was one of Eredin's stewards.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:41]** She's like, that's why she's so honorable.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:47]** Also, this evil guy, which I, if I remember right, was also one of Eredin's stewards.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:50]** And then funny bit of Pathfinder lore.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:53]** No, his Norber, I think.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:56]** Folks in the willing can correct me.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:59]** And my favorite is a god who is still a god in Starfinder.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** I think his name is Caden.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:07]** He's a guy who was getting drunk with his friends, and his friends were like, I bet you wouldn't pass the test.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** And he's like, bet.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:12]** So then he gets really drunk, blackout drunk, and then he became a god.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:13]** That's it.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** All right.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** Well, okay.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** Dope.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:17]** Legendary.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:19]** This is great.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:20]** I'm going to take this as well.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:22]** And his pockets are just huge.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:25]** Make sure you're accounting for all this bulk in there.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** No, I mean, it's just a book.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** But I'll say this.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:29]** This is like...

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:46]** relic in the sense that like this should only be in private collections i mean this is a pretty private collection let's be real it's a what's it's in his it's in here's his private collection all right he wants to see uh what about um you think what about the yeah

**[00:32:46 - 00:33:11]** oh yeah well i mean it's me and yara isa and the other idols you don't see anything else that's that's that's there not on bez mara's either not on his little buddy bez mara is not one of the idols bez mara you said earlier that you know i didn't i said that you said you follow you follow bez mara no before that i didn't i'm sorry my bad sorry there's the shirin god but hylax yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:14]** No, I miss... He said Phrasma.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** Phrasma had a zero class.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:18]** Sorry, zero knife.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** Hailstone class.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Alright, well, whatever.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:21]** Cool.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** Is this the last relic in this room?

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** It's not really a relic.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:26]** That's like a modern weapon.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** That and the star stone compass are modern things.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:31]** The long sword is absolutely a relic and the book is absolutely a relic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:32]** Cool.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:36]** I'm taking this and this and this and this too.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** So great.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** What do you think of it?

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:41]** Cause I just think it's like a book.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:43]** Well, here's knows who this is, right?

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:46]** Cause of his mysticism, whatever, I guess is what you're saying earlier.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:53]** So yeah, he's like, this is an old kind of forgotten God of humans, but very legendary in his time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:55]** So there you go.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** Can you go?

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:56]** Wow.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** Okay.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:58]** Yeah.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** I don't really have any thoughts.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** I think we need to keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:03]** I agree we do.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:06]** I'm wondering if we need to turn on this electricity.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:11]** I wonder if maybe if we do that, then somehow a door will open.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** What?

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** Why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** I don't know.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** Maybe.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** Why would it be us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:22]** I would caution against fixing things.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:26]** I hear from the group that that's probably something I shouldn't do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** I think it's okay.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** It's more like a pillow that washes over you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:44]** As you're about to walk out, you hear a door open and you hear you don't hear any language, but you hear a door open and you hear footsteps and then they fade away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** Okay, dope.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** All right.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:50]** How long has it been since he went invisible?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:55]** Now that you've been reading everything, I'd say you probably have another... It's been about 10 to 15 minutes.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** I'm going to move the clock forward about 15 minutes.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** How long do you have?

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** One minute for level, so I need to cast it again.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** Yeah, so you would need to cast it again if you want it.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** If you want to use it again.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** Okay.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** Cast it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:11]** All right, so then here's is going to like... Okay.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:11]** Okay.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:34]** cool i think we need to go to the garage yeah yeah let's all right do we need to check anything else like over in this general area uh the hall if you can if you can if you want to well i don't know i mean this is kind of your idea are you sure there's nothing else that we're supposed to be looking for i didn't see did you check the control room i didn't see anything okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:39]** As you start to walk around the corner and you're invisible, you see that there are two people in the control room.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:45]** There is a man, there's a human male, and then there is a human female.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:49]** And they're talking and they're looking at something on the computer.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:53]** Okay, so do we need to go into the control room?

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:58]** You would recall that Kaniko, she's like, okay, look, the command center is open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** The hangar doors.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:06]** So, okay, so we know where this is now.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:10]** So if we need to do that, I'm guessing they have people stationed in here a lot.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:12]** So if we need to do that, we need to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** Hopefully tomorrow.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:18]** I mean, it might be too late to hope for it, but there won't be anyone in here during the celebration.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:18]** What?

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** I can't hear you.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** Your microphone on your car.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** I'm gonna move around.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** Shut up.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** Scoot back a little bit.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:27]** Around the corners that I don't get.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:29]** Well, you're invisible.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** Okay, well, you're invisible.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** Yes, I'm still invisible.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:36]** Can you go like, nevermind.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:36]** It's pointless.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** All right.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:40]** So look, once we go through the command center, there's a door on the other side.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** Do you know what that goes to?

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** No, I don't.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Inside the command center.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** I've never seen it.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** What goes through this door?

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** That's like literally right behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:46]** I don't know.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:51]** Oh, that's, that's, she turns around and looks, it's inspector Josh's room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** She looks and points to the label.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:57]** That's inspector Josh's room.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** Oh, my God.

**[00:36:59 - 00:36:59]** All right.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:00]** Now I can see.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:01]** Yeah.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Okay.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:04]** Hey, so I think... Do we need to get anything from there?

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** I'm just making sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** Did you just say you want to go into Inspector Heard's room?

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** I recommend against that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:15]** Look, maybe we could do that tomorrow at his pledge party.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** We don't know where he is.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** I'm thinking that other hallway across the way.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:25]** I'm thinking that that is probably where, like, their quarters are for the stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:32]** So, you know, that's probably... Hi, but what if we took Inspector Heard hostage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:40]** Like, we'd probably have... Rick shoots you a look from across the room like, what the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:54]** I can't overemphasize how Will roots back in his chair and like face palms so hard with that idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:58]** I don't recommend taking any hostages.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** That was a funny joke, Colin.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:04]** I can't believe I have to say that out loud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:08]** On this open comms channel to the entire base.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:12]** I wouldn't recommend that.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** All right.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** Clop, clop, clop, clop.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** It's Canada.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:23]** They all trot around like they're on a horse.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** They all do it.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** They all do it.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:27]** All right.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:31]** So Kaniko's like, if you're sure there's nothing else we need to see, then we're good.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** I'm good to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** Okay.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:35]** I think we need to check out the garage like we intended.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** Okay, let's go.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:41]** She needs to roll a stealth check while I'm rolling that.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:45]** Dr. K, Rick, and Colin, what's going on in the warehouse?

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:46]** Talk to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:50]** Colin's still snickering at his kidnapping joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:51 - 00:39:02]** Dr. OK is shaking his head while reassembling the pieces that were taken off of the mech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:02]** Okay.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:14]** Metagame-wise, we probably would have had one of the Peritons keeping an eye on the doors in the bay and had a plan for them to cover for us to get out of the warehouse.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** Yeah.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:20]** That would have been a good idea if we'd done it an episode and a half ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:28]** I mean, that's kind of the intentions from the beginning was give us the tour and have 25 people in that room or whatever the number is.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:28]** 12.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:39]** Anyways, Rick is by the closed doors and he's got his gun not at the ready, but just in hot standby in case something happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** Rick has got a gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:42]** Okay.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:44]** Yeah.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** Is the door like relocked?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:49]** I shut it, but I didn't lock it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:53]** I think we need to go to the garage.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** Rick, do you want to join for the garage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:56 - 00:40:02]** As you say that, Rick hits the button, opens the door again, and steps into the doorway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:22]** and as you step in kaniko like comes up and is moving very quickly she's able to go like underneath the glass where there's just a bit of wall and like quickly move under right when they're turning to like look at something and she just she she nailed her uh self-check she gets across the way

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:50]** make sure the end of the hallway is clear before rick comes out okay let me check let me check she she walks down looks around the corner doesn't see anything it's about 6 45 650 ish now we have 15 minutes let's get in get out you have 15 minutes to do something but then keep in mind after seven people will settle into other places so you'll still have time


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:57]** And he's going to turn to Dr. Okay and Colin and nod to them as I'm heading out.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:01]** I think you're going to need to unlock this door like you unlocked the first one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:24]** it looks the same did you try to open it no it just it looks like it's the same i wouldn't try that well i thought there are people in that one can you go dr okay as rick uh steps out into the hallway uh we'll move into position to support nice nice by the door love it love it okay of course john loves it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:26]** Oh, you guys are getting ready for a fight.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** I love this.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:27]** Smile.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** All right.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:29]** Okay.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** Calla doesn't move.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** You can see through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:34]** Calla's posted up by the other door just to gaze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:36]** Oh, they're just tinkering away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:40]** You can see through the vision glass that this looks like it's a garage.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:46]** The only light that you can see is coming in from the light in the hallway itself.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** Okay.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** Is it clear?

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** Let's take a look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** I guess here's just looks.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** I don't see anybody either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:57]** But you're going to need to do another similar check if you want to do this.

**[00:41:57 - 00:42:03]** There's two sets of... There's the alarm that you'll need to disable if you want to do that.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** And then there's the unlock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:08]** Alright, 32 for the first roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** Yeah, you're able to disable the alarm.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** Okay, brilliant.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** And the next one is 33.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:17]** And a nat 20, but that doesn't really matter, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Do you need me to support on any of those?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** No, you're good.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:26]** As you're starting to finish it, you hear a door open.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:28]** It sounds like it's coming from the command center.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** Quick, get in, get in, get in.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** We got movement.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** And then the door opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** Let's go inside.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** Hurry up.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Dr. Okay closes the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** Okay.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** Rick closes the door behind them.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** Okay.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:43]** And he's going to step into the corner of that room.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:45]** Yeah.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:47]** You can hide behind some stuff over there if needs be.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** Here's his invisible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:55]** It's you see that this door, this airlock door to the west.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:59]** opens up into a room that's, what, 30 by 40?

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:05]** It's a massive two-story height garage.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** It's pretty large.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:11]** Not as big as the hangar, but definitely...

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:30]** definitely sizable there are two large roll-up airlock doors that take up most of the eastern wall but the room feels sterile unused you can see that in one little like pad there is a hover truck

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:39]** And in the other pad where there are vehicles, there are two police cruisers, all three vehicles painted blue, marked with Stuart emblems.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:48]** And you see that next to you kind of where there's like some desks and some rolling racks, some tool cabinets.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:55]** It's just laid out with every tool that you would think imaginable across the west wall and the south wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:56 - 00:44:01]** The doors in the vehicle bays, that just goes to the outside, is that correct?

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:02]** Outside the base?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** You think so.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:04]** Okay.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:10]** These are the same type of doors, the same quality of doors that are in the hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:16]** Uh, the plan was to take all of these and these only, the other base.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** Or was it to also take a ship?

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** I can't recall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:23]** Well, I have to get my crew out too.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:33]** So my understanding was that if I can get them on the ship, then either if you're able to open the hangar doors...

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:50]** or find a way to just shut off power, create a diversion, I don't know, then I can get to the ship and then either I can protect you as you come to the ship or maybe you take some of these vehicles here and I meet you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** I'm not sure.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:57]** Rick, this is what you wanted to quote borrow, correct?

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:57]** Some of these things?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:01]** Yes, and I think if we were going to borrow one, we should borrow all of them.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** I think I agree.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:09]** At this point, it is theft, and if they find any of these missing, at least they won't be able to track us down as quickly without the other vehicles.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:15]** So there are three vehicles, at least three vehicles here for us to take.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** How many people can be on each of these vehicles?

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Yeah.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** Do we know just by looking at them?

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:23]** Give me a... Piloting?

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** I mean, we should be able to count seats, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:33]** Yeah, I mean, you can walk around and you can see that the truck...

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:38]** technically in Starfinder mechanical terms, it's an all-terrain transport.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:48]** The police, the two police cruisers are police cruiser, which is also a Starfinder thing.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:50]** The actual police cruiser flies.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:56]** You can tell that these have been modified to hover to be able to move quickly across land instead of fly.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:00]** As you're stepping through there, Dr.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:11]** O.K., you think you hear, just for a brief second, you think you hear kind of boots starting to walk down that hallway.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:14]** I think you can hear that without a perception check, just with your passive perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** I think we might have company in the hallway.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** Can you go take cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** Okay, okay, okay.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** She moves to the other side of the door.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:25]** Here's, are you going to, you have like essentially one action.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:27]** You're going to move, you're going to hide.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:30]** Well, here's is invisible.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:31]** Note that.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:34]** But he is going to hide behind the truck anyway, just in case.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:35]** Okay.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** Happens to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:52]** There's, I think all of you see that the slats of light that are coming through the vision glass into the garage cover as somebody walks by, a shadow walks by.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:58]** And then you wait for a second and nothing happens.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:00]** Nice.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** You're clear for the moment.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:07]** Well, I agree, Rick, that we should take all of this.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:12]** And Kaniko, it sounds good that what you're saying about taking your ship.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:15]** So we just need to get into the control room and open the hangar for you.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** And then we make our escape from here.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** Is that the idea yet?

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:19]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:24]** Here's confirm that you can open these doors and start them before we leave.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** Give me ten minutes.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:30]** Give me a either an engineering or computers.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:31]** Here's.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** What's your engineering?

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:35]** My engineering's... Or, Rick, you could also do it.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:54]** And as you're looking, Kaniko points out and says, Guys, look, I think the same panels to open the hangar doors, it's the same thing here, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** They took them out?


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:55 - 00:48:21]** the doors are unpowered i i'm guessing you could maybe open it even though they're unpowered you could like you you could jimmy a power for these because they're smaller um but you could also probably open it from the command center so you could do two in one and she's like pointing kind of around she actually turns on her flashlight and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:25]** And quickly shows you where they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:29]** So we can open all of the hangar doors all at once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** Yeah, you might need to.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:34]** I don't know anything about computers, but you might need to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:38]** What were your engineering and what do you call it checks?

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** Let's just say I'm going to roll engineering.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:43]** I have a plus 13 computers to your question, Rick, and 10 engineering.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:45]** I can assist you.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:49]** His computer's check failed miserably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** You don't know if it failed.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:54]** You don't know if it failed.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** Yeah, but you don't know if it failed.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:56]** Great.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** I rolled a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** I rolled a 20.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** I rolled a nat one.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:01]** Yeah.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:03]** Plus my modifier was like 13.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** Well, there's no natural fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** It's just low, but there's no fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** So you have this.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:09]** That's a 14 plus two is a 16.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** I'm so used to killing it with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:18]** This check was to be able to understand like kind of what is going on with each of these vehicles as far as their security.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:25]** And I'll say that because you rolled a nat one and rolled lower, you're not entirely sure about...

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** The police cruisers.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** The truck looks like it's good.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** The truck looks like the key's sitting inside on the dash.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:32]** Like, you could just jump in the truck and go.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:33]** If you could get out.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:40]** The police cruisers, you would need a little more time to understand exactly what's going on.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:44]** It seems like there are systems around the doors, the steering wheel, and the ignition.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:50]** And I'm telling you, both meta and as a player, you're like, this is...

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:52]** I have some options here.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:55]** There's a sensor and a lock on each system.

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:04]** So in order to access it, you're thinking... Your brain's like, I could just disable it.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:08]** If I just wanted to get out of here, I could just do a quick check and disable it.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:11]** I could spend a little longer...

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:16]** And I could put us, the PCs, in as drivers on the lock.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:19]** So we could unlock and lock the vehicles ourselves.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:22]** And then you think, but that doesn't account for the sensors.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** So we could do that.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:28]** But then whatever sensors are in there, whatever they trigger, they will still trigger.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** But maybe we don't care because we're just trying to get out.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** Or you're like, f*** it.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:35]** I could spend, God, probably like two, three hours in here.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:39]** Maybe you're okay with that in the dark working on this.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:42]** And I could reset the sensors and the locks.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:46]** So I could take these entirely offline from the steward space.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:53]** So it's clear to you that this is going to be a lot of work.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:58]** to get the police cruisers online, depending on what you want to get out of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:02]** Okay, if we did it off the cuff, it wouldn't be so successful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:05]** Wait, did you ever answer how many people can fit in all these things?

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** So police cruisers can each hold two people?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** Police cruisers, I think, can hold technically three.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:15]** It's like one driver and two quote-unquote prisoners.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** You know, like folks in the back.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** Passengers.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:22]** I believe, let me pull up on my handy-dandy link.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:43]** here uh the all-terrain can always sabotage them right so they don't run that's true yeah yeah yeah you could uh the all-terrain transport truck can hold seven the police cruiser can hold uh yeah three passengers so one driver and two other


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:43 - 00:52:02]** individuals hey it would be so cool to steal these things well here's can you go there is enough room for all of us and your peritons in each of these if we take all three of these vehicles what the problem but that leaves your ship here behind then again that is not your ship it belongs to orbeez just let it be trusted

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:04]** Wait, sorry, what?

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:08]** There should be enough... I'm speaking plainly now.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:11]** There should be enough seats for all of us and the Paratons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** All these vehicles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** We can just drive this shit.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:15]** That's true.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:19]** Except for the ship belongs to Orvier.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** Fuck Orvier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:20]** That's fine.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** Orvier aside, this is my worry.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** I hear you.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** It would be great to get away.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** It would also be great to be able to get off planet.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** And these vehicles can't get off planet.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** That's my concern.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:40]** But maybe there's something at this Terrapin that we can check out.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:42]** I don't know.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:45]** We've got to roll the dice.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:55]** Personally, it feels a little bit like, weirdly, we might have a better chance of trying both ship and vehicles.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:00]** I'm happy if we can all just pile in and we can get these in.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:01]** That's fine.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** I just feel bad.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:04]** I can't help unlock these.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** The best that I can do is to try to get the crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** I can unlock them.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:12]** It will take a while to do, but I can spend tonight doing that.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:14]** And I need to focus.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:16]** It's going to take a little while.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** So I need to do it before we make our escape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:22]** Are you suggesting you stay here alone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Well...

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:31]** It might be good to have backup, but... I can stay as backup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:35]** Because I... What if... No, no, no.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** Hear me out.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:43]** What if... What if they come in and I take the fall?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** They know me.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:49]** And then I can be like, oh, I was just looking for some tools in here.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** Right?

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:56]** Something that you cool engineer mechanic folks do that I don't.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** And you can keep working.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** Rick's like, yeah, that's a great idea.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** And pushes the button and leaves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Sweet!


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:03]** Sweet!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:08]** Metagaming, I don't think it's the wisest thing.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:14]** But, I mean, it might be better to sabotage a couple of them and spend, I don't know, or all of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:22]** You think that, by the way, you think that while you're looking through, maybe, Rick, you're perusing all the tools.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:30]** You think, just to give you all the information so everything's out there, there's enough tools here to develop two specialist engineering kits.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:36]** One for working on vehicles and one for working on facilities.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:39]** About 20 minutes per kit to put it all together.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:39]** It's a lot.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:43]** There's also, if you really want to get into it,

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:53]** three spools of 200 feet of titanium alloy cable, one bulk each, and one spool of 50 feet of adamantine alloy cable.

**[00:54:54 - 00:55:07]** So if you just wanted to get some extra copper there, I mean, not copper, but adamantine and titanium, you could roll some spool across the hallway there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** How big is all this stuff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** The spools we can just take?

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** Three bulk.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:18]** Yeah, it's three bulk and one light bulk.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:24]** Dr. O'Kane, Colin, what are you thinking as you're hearing this comms chatter, but you're not seeing any of this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:28]** I mean... Maybe you're just listening.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:35]** It's been a while since I've been involved in boosting cars, but you could.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:40]** If you want to spend the time behind enemy lines and take the fall, can you go?

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** I would do it.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:45]** I mean, that's your call.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** We'll try to cover you as best we can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** I'd do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:48]** Can you go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** You'll be fine.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:51]** I'm sure that they won't do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:51 - 00:56:02]** If it comes to that, I get the impression that between you and the troops and us, we may have numbers on our side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** Our comms are ready to roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:07]** I'm ready to get the f*** out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** What if we just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:40]** caught them all while they were i mean they're not expecting anything tonight i'm assuming what a difference 20 minutes makes what a difference 20 minutes ago i was crazy for even suggesting we take leader man hostage and now we're like staging a coup i don't think we should fight well you're the one that's saying that we could take them all i've got all the peritons

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:43]** From a metagaming perspective, I think we have numbers.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** I don't think it's a good idea.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:48]** I don't think it's wise.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:54]** I don't think it should be plans A or B. Or C or D or E. I don't like this idea.

**[00:56:55 - 00:57:05]** I think Colin, in particular, would start that fight before letting... Now I'm really mad about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** I shouldn't have even tried to ship you.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:09]** This is not where I wanted to go.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:11]** I didn't want you to lose your judgment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:18]** Don't you think, though, that they would be easier to take out while they're enjoying some festivities?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:25]** Wait, is this all happening because Colin doesn't want Kaniko to stay alone for years overnight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:28]** If this is why, Colin, I swear to God.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** Okay, fine.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** Why doesn't Colin come and help watch Koneko?

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:35]** And hopefully his better judgment stays intact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** This is absolutely hilarious.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:40]** No, it's not, but it is now.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:48]** That was not why Colin was pitching this idea, but I like where that's going, so sure.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:52]** And thank you, John, for just letting this happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:55]** John's just covering his face.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:55]** Like, what the...

**[00:57:55 - 00:58:00]** He's like, oh God, what the fuck are you guys going to do?

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:10]** Rick is going to say in the columns, like, if we are talking about going tonight, we all need to go and we need to go now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:14]** Okay, well, we can't take these immediately.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:17]** We got to spend some time getting them if we want to take them with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:19]** And that means you're going to stay overnight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:22]** I think we should...

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:44]** wait out the night it it depends because the engineering kits is that going to speed up like the what you were talking about earlier john like how long would it take with with using all the tools at my disposal to like do this well the engineering kit is a what you say it was 20 minutes each kit just to assemble like if like if you wanted to put together you think it would take you less than a minute


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:49]** if you just wanted to disable the lock and there are three in each system, right?

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:56]** So like, if you just wanted to like go through, you could probably get through all of them in a minute or two.

**[00:58:56 - 00:59:00]** Uh, if you needed to, if you want it, what type of kit was it?

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:09]** A super, super, super, it's a specialist engineering kit for working on vehicles and one for facilities maintenance, which would probably help in turning on the power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:09]** If you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:11]** Yeah.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:18]** And you think it would be about each lock for about 30 minutes if you want to reset per vehicle.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:22]** So about an hour total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** Rick is going to load.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:32]** Rick's just going to say, so the plan is get these all unlocked and ready to go for tomorrow.

**[00:59:32 - 01:00:01]** yes correct yeah and as he as he gets adding before he hears even answers him he loads uh both spools or all three spools into the back of the truck uh and then how much does he know how much tools it's going to take for the engineering kit for the the doors he's going to take that stuff back with him to give to dr okay and he's going to leave the other stuff for here's for the vehicles to make his own kit for the vehicles is that or do i need a role for that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:19]** sorry and you want to know he wants you don't need to roll for that identify the tools yeah that's fine you don't you don't need to roll for that i just want to make clear so i understand you're trying to turn the power on where or like not what power no power


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:22]** You're talking about there was a group of tools.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:27]** There were the doors that needed power from the control room, or we could hotwire it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:32]** Yeah, you said there's two engineering kits that we can make.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:40]** Right, so if you wanted to just hotwire the doors, again, the only way to open the hangar doors with the starships is from the command center.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:47]** It seems like you could also probably open the doors in the garage from the command center.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:59]** the garage doors, or if you wanted to open them just by themselves to kind of hotwire it, uh, you, you would probably need, I would have to provide power, right?

**[01:00:59 - 01:00:59]** Yeah.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:03]** You would need, I am looking for it literally in the text here.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:09]** Uh, it's, it, it would probably take about 10 minutes and about one battery.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:15]** So your specialist kit is not needed in order to open these doors, but yeah.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:19]** So what do the specialist kits give you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:21]** They give you a plus two?

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:21]** Yeah.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:22]** Plus two?

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** They give you a plus two.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:28]** But they only give it to you for the vehicles, and they only give it to you if you're going to override the doors locally?

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:29]** Or will they help you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:32]** You don't need those to override the doors locally.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** You don't need those.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:33]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:36]** You need to do it remotely, to do it from the control center.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** It'll help us with that?

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** No, it wouldn't help with that.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:40]** So it will help you locally?

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:40]** Yeah.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** It won't help.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:44]** You don't need it locally or remotely.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:47]** So what the f*** is the other engineering kit for then, Josh?

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** I'm confused now.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:51]** It's for facilities, maintenance, anything else that you might want to do.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:58]** If there's anything else regarding ducts or repairing the power in the chapel or anything else.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:02]** It's not necessarily a one-to-one that it's trying to get you to open the doors there.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:04]** So that's â€“ whatever.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:08]** I'm saying that that one is not necessary for what Hears is going to do tonight.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:10]** So he's going to take all that stuff with him back to Dr. O.K.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:20]** And then he's going to leave Hears here to figure out the engineering kit and then work on the cars and get them prepped for tomorrow.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:27]** And right before he opens that door to step across the hall, he's going to turn back to Hears and Kaniko and say â€“

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:31]** I will be ready if something happens.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:31]** Comms are open.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:33]** All right.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** He's just going to nod at them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:36]** Thanks for your support from afar.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:37]** I really appreciate it.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:39]** Have a nice night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:43]** That wasn't the plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:57]** And as you open the door, there's a, you hear the soft kind of like chime of like a bing, bing-a-ling, bing-a-ling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:57 - 01:03:00]** As we hit 7 o'clock.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:01]** And it's the shift change.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** And doors start to open.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:09]** Rick shuts the door again.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:10]** And that's our game.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:13]** We'll see what you do next time.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:15]** What side of the door do you shut?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** Are you in the hallway or in the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:19]** Is he in the hallway?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:22]** He didn't step out yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:23]** I just opened the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:26]** Looks like you're sticking around after all, Rick.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** Grab a wrench.
