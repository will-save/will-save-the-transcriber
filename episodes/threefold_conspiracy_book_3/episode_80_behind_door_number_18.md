## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:27]** You have come to the right place where we drink Ovaltine.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:31]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** We do not drink Ovaltine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:35]** Rich, rich, chocolatey Ovaltine.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:36]** I'm relatively positive on Ovaltine.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:37]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:43]** I am your non-lethal GM, John Swan, and we haven't talked about food in a while, I feel like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** Since last episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:46]** I feel like we talked about Ovaltine two weeks ago.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:49]** We did talk about Ovaltine, but I have a question.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** As I always do.

**[00:01:52 - 00:02:01]** What is the one childhood restaurant that you will love for the rest of your life?

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:06]** It doesn't matter if somebody's like, ah, that's the worst food I've ever had on Yelp.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:09]** It doesn't matter if somebody's like, it changes owners.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** You're going to love it all the time.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Will, I think I know yours.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** Then guess.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:14]** What is it?

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** Which I haven't mentioned yet.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** Is it Yakis?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** No.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** No.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** I didn't have that in childhood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:20]** All right, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** I didn't have it in childhood.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:24]** I mean, that is a longtime favorite.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:33]** I mean, if you consider, like, teenage years, like, childhood, then I guess, yeah, Yakis would be it.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:35]** That is my favorite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** What is Yakis?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** Yeah, I've never heard of that.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:46]** It is a small chain in Southern California that serves a fusion of Hawaiian and American food.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** And it's just amazingly delicious.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:49]** Okay.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:56]** No, I was going to go with the AYSO favorite for Southern California.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** And it's not Shakey's Pizza.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** It's Roundtable.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** Oh, Roundtable?

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** Roundtable.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** Roundtable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** Can you still like them?

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** Are they still round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** Yes, they are.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:06]** Okay.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** They are still around, my friend.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** They are?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** Roundtable is the jam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:11]** Yes, we're...

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:14]** Round Table had the best arcade games.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:18]** It had the best pizza for your buck.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Yes.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** Good, good.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** When you're there, you're royalty.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** You're pizza royalty.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:27]** Is that where Olive Garden got their phrase from?

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** They stole it.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:29]** I don't know.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** Yeah.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** Sounds right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:35]** They have a loyalty program that's fit for pizza royalty, according to their website.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** The royalty loyalty?

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:36]** Pizza royalty.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** It writes itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** It does.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:50]** We did... We didn't have Roundtable, but I do recall... This is not my answer, but I remember when Pizza Hut had dessert pizzas, and you could go to their buffet, and they had like... It was like a pie pizza.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** Yeah, that was good.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** That was good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Pizza Hut's buffet was...

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** This is a pizza conversation.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:56]** It is.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:59]** You describing the place reminds me of CeCe's.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** CeCe's?

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** CeCe's pizza I've had.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:03]** That's cheap.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:07]** With the little arcade in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:10]** Pizza Hut, they're...

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:26]** was like a salad bar of pizzas where cc's is like you go up and they they slice it it's like a buffet are you talking about like the seeds with the hat with like the glasses like that logo no it's chi chi's pizza not cc's pizza


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:32]** Are Chi Chi and CC brother and sister and they run competing pizza restaurants?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:37]** Is this like comparing the guys to the gowls?

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** We're coming to America.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:43]** I was going to say another pizza chain.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** It's not even a chain.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** I think it was a single location.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:47]** It was Nickelodeon Pizza in Rialto, California.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** What?

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:51]** It was a part of... There's this little area in Rialto.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** I think it's called Frontier Town.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** And it was like...

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:59]** It was just a single row of buildings that had a facade in the front that looked like Wild West.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]** And the streets were like dirt road.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** And it was right next to the freeway.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** So there was like no real immersion.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:16]** But they had Nickelodeon Pizza and Nickelodeon Pizza was just like, it was the place we went to after every T-Ball game.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:37]** and they had your shitty pizza that was cheap and they had pictures of coke and an arcade with three arcades including ninja turtles and it was just it was that was home ninja turtles game is awesome i don't know which one you're talking about if there are a few there i see a nickelodeon pizza in colton why is it called nickelodeon pizza

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:59]** does it have slime on it or something yeah it was called not rialto they're same thing whatever uh why is it called nickelodeon because nickelodeon was like pizza well the term nickelodeon is actually comes from like i forget exactly where like old timey movies it was you you would they were nickel you would put in a nickel yeah oh what and it would play a thing

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** That is crazy.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** I had no idea.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:05]** And so the channel Nickelodeon comes from that term.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Holy crap.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:11]** And since this was an old-timey West place, then it was the Nickelodeon.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** Today I learned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** I did not know this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:17]** I mean, we grew up on Nickelodeon, and we had no idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:20]** I missed that because my cat wanted to get out and knocked over a light.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:21]** But you know what?

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** I'm going to...

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** I'm going to live with that mystery for the rest of my life, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** It's a good mystery, man.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:29]** I feel like it's something you should know, so I'm sorry for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** You'll have to find out on We'll Save Wednesday when we roll the episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** I think I will.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:36]** There's no way I can't go back in time.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** Kev, tell us what restaurant.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:40]** Was that your favorite, Nickelodeon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:50]** I don't... When you guys ask restaurant, I think like sit-down restaurants, and I don't really have one, except for... Did you guys ever go to... I want to say it was Tony Romano's?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:50]** Tony Roma's?

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** Tony Roma's?

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** Tony Roma's?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** The ribs, please?

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:58]** I just think there was a restaurant that had like...

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:02]** The waiter's all dressed up as clowns or magicians or cowboys.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:04]** Every waiter was dressed differently.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:08]** I have no idea what restaurant it was, but it marks my memories.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:10]** This is a strange place.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** It's that one.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:19]** Fast food chains, I was going to say Baker's, which is an Inland Empire only chain.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:23]** How do you know all these random things that just...

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:32]** Bakers is if greasy-ass Americans discovered Mexican food.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:35]** It's the best way I can describe it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:39]** It literally says in Wikipedia, in the Inland Empire region.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** It calls out exactly what you said.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:44]** There is no mistaking it with anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:48]** It's like Del Taco at its worst.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** And it's amazing.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** I love Del Taco.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** Now that I have high cholesterol, I will never go there again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** Del Taco's better than Taco Bell.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** I know we had a discussion about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:01]** Unpopular opinion, but it's popular among us.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** How could it not be?

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** It's so much better.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:05]** Legion's leagues better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:17]** I don't have an opinion because I'm not a Taco Bell fan and I don't have Del Taco nearby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** So like, I just, that's fair.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** I'm, I'm in taco wasteland.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:20]** Yeah.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:02]** There were three Mexican places there.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** One was called Margarita's.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** I forget the second one.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:08]** The second one was like literally a food truck type place.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** That was amazing.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:14]** And then the third one was like Agave or something like that.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** And we went there for dinner one night.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:19]** And I was like, oh, I'll take the carne asada, blah, blah, blah.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:24]** And the waiter corrected me and said, it's pronounced carne asada.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:27]** And I was like, I'm never coming back here.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:27]** Wait, what?

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:27]** What did he say?

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:29]** Never say it again.


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:29]** Never.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:33]** He was so confident about it.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:35]** I was like, bro, I grew up in Southern California.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:36 - 00:10:02]** was he he wasn't even ethnic he was just like a guy that worked there like no he's a white guy from new hampshire yeah exactly that's he was in like his sixth year of grad school and just completely overconfident he was getting his uh yeah languages no offense to new hampshire people but you're the last people that i expect to know how to like pronounce not normal english words or like non-english words sorry i've been to new hampshire it is a place of not that stuff

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** I can say this because I have family from New Hampshire.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:07]** It's where you live, free, or die.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** Granite State.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:13]** I'm glad that we can point to episode 80 as the 80 where we start hating on specific states.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:19]** On our pod name, certain states start going gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** Just check them out.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:23]** Somehow we lost New Hampshire.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:34]** The symbol for New Hampshire is the face in the mountain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:39]** I forget the actual term for it.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:45]** It's called the old man in the mountain or something, I think.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:45]** It fell.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** It's broken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:46]** Really?

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** Oh, I guess the granite's not good.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** Oh, f***.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:54]** It's too much limestone.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** The leaves in the fall are gorgeous in New Hampshire.

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:01]** I've never been to a place that has better leaves in the United States than New Hampshire, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:04]** That's because you haven't been to Maine, so it's fine.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:07]** I have been to Maine, but I have not been in the fall.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:10]** They're kind of the same region.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:13]** I'm just trying to get a war between Maine and New Hampshire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:18]** I feel like Maine would lose selling Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Kelly, what is your restaurant?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:26]** American History will look back to this date and know that it was the beginning of the New Hampshire Civil War.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:35]** If we are a boxed out paragraph or two in a future American textbook, I will be happy.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** That's it.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:39]** We'll get famous for something.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** We'll save the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:43]** Initiated the war between...

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:50]** I'll take obscure American history for a thousand dollars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:56]** It will be just like those history books that I love where it's all about one specific item and how it tracked down history.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:58]** Anyway, Kelly, good.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** After you take your beautiful drink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:04]** It's hard because, like, we're talking about restaurants that we would still go to today, right?

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:08]** But as a kid, my favorite was Hometown Buffet.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:12]** As far as, like, normal American food goes.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** Hometown Buffet.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:17]** I feel like that would still be my answer had we not lived through the COVID-like thing.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:21]** Because, like, now I just...

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** Is it like Cracker Barrel?

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:27]** No, it's not like Cracker Barrel at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** It's like Cracker Barrel if you ought to share a place.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** No, it's not like Cracker Barrel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** I expect it's closer to Golden Corral.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:37]** Think everything that's not like that.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** It's like Sizzler, but worse.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:43]** It is the bottom of the barrel of buffets, but as a kid, it has literally everything.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:46]** It's literally everything done to the least amount of effort.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** But when you're a kid, you don't give a shit.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:51]** You can try one of everything that exists on the planet.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** How?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** How happy were we?

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:53]** We were so great.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:58]** I blame my parents for this, but at Hometown Buffet, I'd always get sick.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:02]** Because I would get nothing but desserts and chicken nuggets.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:06]** And then I would drink like a gallon of chocolate milk.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:11]** I have thrown up at more Hometown Buffets than I have at random bars across the country.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:16]** That feels like two juice and a lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:19]** And if this is anyone's first episode, that is a feat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:30]** I mean, I used to throw up at the Golden Corrals because I would make friends with the omelet guy and get like three or four omelets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:32]** Dude, those yeast rolls.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** What is a yeast roll?

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** Those hit different.

**[00:13:35 - 00:14:05]** yeah golden corral has these like butter yeast rolls and they're like have you ever had a crispy cream donut yeah oh yeah you know how they're like mostly air on the inside it's like that but it's a whole roll like a dinner roll god and it's so good it's it's so good but they like as you eat them they expand on the inside and it you just turn into like a bloated yeah it's sort of like except instead of turning purple you just vomit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:15]** We should just show up at one of these places where only eight-year-olds like to eat and just as a group eat there and think of it as really cool.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** We should all do it sometime.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:17]** I'm 100% down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:22]** Dude, next con, let's look for one of these around wherever the con is.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** Yeah, let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:23]** Will?

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:24]** Sorry, Will.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** I was just...

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** Thinking of buffets that I like to frequent.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** Yeah.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:33]** Do you guys know Soup Plantation?

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Dude, Soup Plant's closed.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** Sweet Tomatoes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** Sweet Tomatoes?

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:42]** It was a chain, and they shut down because of the pandemic.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:45]** But apparently they're going to open one in Tucson.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:45]** That's good.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** Really?

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:46]** All right.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** So let's go to Tucson.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:51]** Because Sweet Tomatoes, their bread and their pizza, I don't know what they did.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:53]** That was almost my choice.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** I liked their broccoli salad.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:55]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** I thought that just hit right.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** And they had like focaccia bread.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** Dude, the focaccia.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:01]** It always gets you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:07]** Sweet Tomato was the place I learned that I could legitimately eat salad for an entire meal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** I was just thinking the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** I was literally thinking the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** How do you make it edible?

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** You just cover it in stuff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:42]** yeah that's what they do there's some black magic going on it is just i don't know yeah it was good it was good all right we should get planned but oh sorry did everyone get their thing i don't know if vinnie gave his like i didn't restaurant uh oh you didn't what's funny is my answer is basically the same as kelly's except because i'm florida man um ryan's steakhouse

**[00:15:42 - 00:16:06]** oh ryan's yeah it's like the after church sunday afternoon spot i distinctly remember just like stuffing my face with so much good american food i have one particularly vivid memory of i had a i had a really strong and i still do actually for grape tomatoes love grape tomatoes would legitimately eat a bowl of grape tomatoes um

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:13]** And I remember forking one and putting it in my mouth and taking a bite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** You did what to a tomato?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** I forked it.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** Grape tomatoes.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** Those ones have exploded in your mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** This is a bougie place, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** And then I put it in my mouth.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** And I was a kid, so my mouth wasn't that big.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:25]** So half the tomato was sticking out of my mouth.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** And I bit the tomato.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:36]** And the seed juice inside shot across the table onto my dad's brand new white dress shirt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:36 - 00:17:01]** oh man and that was the last time we went to ryan's next time i'm in town i'm gonna be like hey we should all go to dinner let's go to ryan's that's it we'll have to find i think they all closed like 15 years ago i've seen one open in north carolina done road trip that's not that far

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:06]** The Jacksonville Business Journal in 1999 said that two of them closed.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** So, you know.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:08]** All right.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:08]** Good Lord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** This seems like a really nice place, though, man.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:13]** They got Dom Perignon on the menu.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** What the?

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:16]** This doesn't sound like a hometown buffet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:18]** Ryan's Steakhouse.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** I don't know.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:20]** Yeah.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** Maybe I'm looking at the wrong one.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** There's probably more than one Ryan somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:26]** Maybe my rose-colored kid glasses.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:29]** Like, I wouldn't have known what Dom was at the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:31]** It was a super fancy restaurant.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:33]** You're like, it's like a hotel buffet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:38]** It's exactly the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:42]** Your dad did not want to stay there.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** He was asked to leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:48]** I'm sorry, but there's something on your shirt.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** You are an embarrassment to this institution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:55]** Our dinner jacket policy is not to be besmirched.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:55 - 00:18:02]** I guarantee Ryan's family steakhouse in Jacksonville, Florida did not have a dress code.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:06]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:07]** That's very true.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:11]** John, we need to know yours because I don't think you answered it.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:12]** Or did you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** Dude, it's the same.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:15]** It will always be the same.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:17]** I'm ride or die for Arby's, man.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:28]** I will always... I don't know why Arby's gets the... I don't know why... There's one in Hollywood, and they have the old sign with the huge hat.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** It's great.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** It's actually decent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:33]** I know people complain about Arby's, but I actually kind of like it, too.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:37]** You get a big-ass sandwich with 300 layers of meat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** I don't complain about Arby's.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:41]** My bowel movements complain about Arby's.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** Those curly fries are pretty good too.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** Curly fries.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:48]** I still take McDonald's fries.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:51]** But like, I'm all for shitty hot dogs.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:54]** And honestly, almost all fast food is my game.

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:00]** But now that I have high cholesterol, I'm like, do you have a salad option?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** It's depressing.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:05]** Before I knew how bad it was for you, I just wish I didn't know.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Because fast food is great.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:13]** Don't you just miss rolling up to Wienerschnitzel and getting 20 hot dogs and just eating that for hours?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:13]** Wienerschnitzel?

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** I forgot about Wienerschnitzel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:17]** Yeah, it's great.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** The worst place you can be, but it's so delicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** I don't even know if there's any Wienerschnitzels near me.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** There are.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** Oh, near you.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:23]** I don't know.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** Kevin lives somewhere else.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** I think they're West Coast only.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:31]** My father-in-law, when he was younger, accepted a job at Wienerschnitzel.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** And they were like...

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:57]** hey first day he's like hey what's up they're like hey sorry man you gotta shave that mustache and he's like i'm not going to and he quit just first day just straight up was like nope i'm not gonna do it and that's how he never worked at wienerschnitzel no one should make any sacrifices for wienerschnitzel it's like come on like it's wienerschnitzel unless you're like working as like in the c-suite of wienerschnitzel it's not happening


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** The C-suite?

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** You know what I mean.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:02]** The chief hot dog officer.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:02]** CEO.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:04]** Chief hot dog officer.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** CHO.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** Taco Bell has a nightclub.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:08]** That's all I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** Chief chili officer.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** Taco Bell has a nightclub?

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** You can get married at Taco Bell, dude.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:13]** In Vegas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** Wait, really?

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** A nightclub?

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:16]** Yeah.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:16]** Okay.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:19]** We did talk about it very briefly, and then we're like, we should go.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** We should go to all these places.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:22]** I don't know if we should.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:30]** This is why listeners slash viewers, you have to tell your friends about We'll Save, and you also have to join the Discord and stuff like this.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:36]** That way, we can afford one day to go on these random trips and then provide you with good bandwidth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** Yes.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:37]** Yes.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:38]** All right.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** From the table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** We'll record it from the table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** There are no Wienerschen souls in Maryland.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:45]** Tell your mom who has no interest.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** Tell your dad who has no interest.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** Okay.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** That's it.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** What'd you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:50]** What'd you say, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:52]** Well, I don't think there's any Wienerschen souls near me.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** I'm sorry.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:54]** That's it.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** All right, John.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** You were DMing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** So, good.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:06]** I was just saying to all of our new listeners who came here because of Kelly's beautiful words there, to listen to us banter about fast food, welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:08]** Oh, rate us on Spotify, too.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:10]** Like, we have 19 five-star reviews.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:10]** We need 20.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** That's what I need.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:14]** I need that from you guys.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:15]** Those are, yeah.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:48]** I'm going to shout-out Grumpus.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** Grumpus is a good one.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** He's a classic.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:50]** That's it.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:52]** Just shout-out Grumpus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** Grumpus is awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** No offense to Grumpus, but was there a reason?

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:00]** Kevin, I think the closest Wienerschnitzel to you is in Arkansas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:01]** I'm not going there.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:09]** And that is the second state.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:13]** That we are able to offend.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:15]** Wait, I want to shout out someone who's never gotten a shout out before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:19]** Shout out to all our listeners in Arkansas.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:31]** Let's see, what are their roles?

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** They are the willing.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:39]** They're not like a rules lawyer or a GM or anything, but they're respectable because they're online and they do things from time to time.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** They'll message and stuff.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:42]** So here's to you, Hurcon or Herson or whatever.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:22]** Let's do a little recap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:22]** As we do.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:41]** The turns have tabled as four of you bested most of the Pyke's Peritons who were persuaded to attack you by well

**[00:23:42 - 00:24:08]** grace pikes peritons for all you people keeping track at home they are the mercenary group hired by the stewards the contractors to help on this mission to outpost omicron in which you found them they are led by orvier pike and the stewards are narla yalamis and shea daisha so

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:15]** You all fought bravely against these members of the Pikes Peritons across these three tight spaces.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:23]** The first one being on the bridge, which was kind of a just stand and shoot and move.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:27]** And there's going to be cover and there's going to be an AOO, but it's a tight quarters.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** And you took them out pretty, pretty quickly.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:34]** Second one, you had the upper hand.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:47]** You had that advantage because you came down the elevator into an open space and saw that two members of the Pikes Paratons were trying to bang down the door of Kaniko Breeze's med bay room.

**[00:24:48 - 00:25:17]** as you are with Kaniko searching looking three of them come to attack you and the roles are switched you are now having to draw them into your single file hallway five feet wide and they being hired mercenaries and I don't know what's going on with Kelly's video I like it that was good he just waved at his PC it was nice that was that was great he waved through his PC yeah

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:19]** Yeah, that was kind of cool.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:22]** I feel like you got sucked into a portal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** It's the fourth wall is breaking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** Kelly, are you in the computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:26]** Ah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** Where am I anymore?

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** What am I?

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:30]** Are the files in the computer?

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:31]** That was the sound I heard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:33]** Can someone pass a message to Will?

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:39]** Can someone pass a message to Will to talk to future Will to, like, get this resolved?

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** Actually, you need to go to the past.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:41]** I'm sorry.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** I need past Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:46]** Future Will has to talk to past Will to get your thing fixed?

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:47]** Yeah.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:48]** We'll bring it over.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:53]** Just bring it over to the present at some point.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:55]** Don't spoil the rest of this show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** I'm sorry.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:58]** You're spoiling my plot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:03]** Future Will is going to come back and spoil the plot and be like, oh, I fixed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** I mean, it'll be addressed in the Council of Wills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:10]** I don't know.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** He'll save it.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** And then we'll title the show Will Save.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** Good Lord.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** And that is how we come full circle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** Zoom in.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** All right, Kelly's back.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:25]** Zoom in on Kelly's face.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** Hey, Kelly.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** Hey, man.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:32]** You look like somebody who likes to go to the hometown buffet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:34]** And scene.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** And cut.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** Great scene, y'all.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:36]** That was good.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** That was good.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:37]** That played out perfectly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:38]** It's a wrap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** It's a wrap.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** It's a whole wrap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** 22 minutes in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:41]** Easy.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:42]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:46]** This is a strange.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** This is a strange place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:50]** That's so good.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** Thank you for that lip sync, Benny.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:54]** It was well-timed.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:58]** So, look, you fight a pretty tough fight, and I'm not going to lie.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** You all struggled.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** They struggled.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** It's not an easy fight.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:06]** My point here is that you have bested them.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:20]** And as we move to the map, there must be something going through your heads as you all are finally able to take a breather.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** You take a moment.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:23]** You wait.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:24]** You are...

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:49]** seeing is there anything going on around you is there anybody else about to jump around the corner we have dr okay and colin edenbrand in kaniko kaniko's old medicine room we have kaniko and rick 19 in the hallway melt a man and uh here's where are you where did your character go

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** I'm looking for here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:57]** Here's is covered up by your ephemeral glowing thing that's chilling out that I can't remember what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:03]** Oh, you're standing on top of Orgoth's body.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:06]** So Orgoth, Hesper, and Ludvaia are all unconscious.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:09]** Been taken out in various means.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:13]** What are you all thinking?

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** What do you want to do?

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:16]** I'm going to hand the reins over to you all now.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** I'm trying to remember.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** Rick, did we leave the bodies?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** We did, didn't we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:25]** Yeah, yeah, we're going to strip them of all their gear for our own safety as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** Yeah, that's why.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:32]** And we might as well put them to use on ourselves, you know, because we can't trust these guys and gals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** I was thinking this a couple episodes ago.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:39]** I'm like, man, we didn't get any loot because we didn't kill these guys.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** We could just stick it out.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:43]** I don't want to be a murder hobo, but like...

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** I need better gear.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** Let's just do it.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:53]** I'm going to... Here's is going to look at the stuff on the unconscious whatever that's below him.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:54]** Whoever it is.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:56]** I can't move, so I don't know who it is.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:56]** Orgott.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** All right.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Here's searches Orgott's body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:04]** Here, let me unpause the game so you can't move.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:13]** Okay, you bend over and you start looking through and as you do, you hear behind you the voice of Kaniko as she says,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** What have you found?

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Are they okay?

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** I thought she was going to be mad.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** All right, good.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** What have I found?

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** Are they okay?

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:27]** They're just passed out, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** Yeah, they're passed out.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** We're talking about non-lethal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:37]** They're unconscious, but you get the sense that she thinks that you are just checking them out to make sure that you're okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:41]** Oh, I'm going to make sure they're all right, and that's all I'm going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:47]** So he is going to sneakily look through their armor and whatever.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:48]** What do they have on them?

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** What kind of armor is this?

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** Sleight of hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** You can just tell that it's freebooter armor.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:59]** You see that there are hand axes and that there is a flame pistol.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:05]** It looks a little bit like a mini blowtorch that has been weaponized.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:09]** And there is like a tank that has a flammable sign on it.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:12]** It's a petrol tank that feeds into the gun and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:41]** shoots out is this that's interesting pistol what uh what are we talking like power wise and stuff i'm trying to find out right now are uh are you thinking of yeah that sounds this is just what you see okay i i love the mental image of of here's just like yeah i'm checking to make sure that they're fine and he's like digging through pockets and checking under folds i've only given you the stuff that you can see on or got right now it's 1d4 fire damage


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:43]** Yeah, that's not really that worth it.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** Who's the one that Dr. O.K.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** gave the relax you to?

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:48]** Orgott.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** That was to Orgott.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:53]** Is that on his body?

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** That is not on her body.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:56]** Her body, sorry.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:58]** Oh, Orgott's a she.

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:58]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** You gave something to her?

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:01]** You injected her, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:01]** No.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** No, it's the relax you.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** I let her borrow it.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Yeah.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:05]** Oh.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Because I was an idiot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** Oh, here's his looking for that right now.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** So you said that's a freebooter armor four?

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** That's impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:12]** No, one.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** What's the... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** Sorry.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:18]** Are you... Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:25]** Are you looking through... I'm looking for my relax you that I was... God dang it.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** All right.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** I got to roll a sleight of hand check, I guess.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:28]** Sorry, Doctor.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:32]** Rick is going to stand up because he's still laying on the ground at this point.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:34]** He stands up holding his pulse caster rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** Did you see them have the relax you?

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** I'm looking right now just to see.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** Does he see the relax you?

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:41]** I'm trying to log into Hero Lab and I can't find it.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** It's really dumb.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** It doesn't work on my PC.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** That's great.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:47]** You have 29 minutes to log into Hero Lab.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:47]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** So, yeah.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:55]** Here's his... So, Rick is standing over you with the pulse caster rifle now pointed at or dot.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:58]** And he comments, like, take off all their weapons.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:02]** We need to clear them in case they are still under the influence of whatever it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** Yeah, that's what I'm doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** We should remove their armor as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:10]** But he doesn't mean to take an armor.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:13]** He means strictly the tactical advantage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:18]** I think that just taking their weapons would be quite adequate.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:20]** I don't know that we need to remove their armor.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** Yeah, we need to remove their armor.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** She's a mystic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** She almost bit my face off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** I don't want to go through that again.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:28]** Yeah, I really don't want to go through that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:38]** What's the harm in taking off their armor and relieving them of their weapons if they've been attacking, well, all of us and you?

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:41]** By the way, I want to get my relax you.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:43]** I think it's downstairs.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:45]** Relax you is not here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:50]** Yeah, Dr. K, I don't know what that, I'm not sure where that is, so I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** I'm sure you don't know.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** I'm going to go search for it.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:56]** All right, so here's this guy on the side of hand check.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Really talking to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:01]** And Vinny, who has his hand patiently raised, what's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:04]** I just, like, I, Vinny, have a cultural question.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:11]** Like if we were to strip their armor off, is that basically like leaving them out in public in their underpants?

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:15]** Like is that the cultural equivalent of doing that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:21]** Honestly, it might go one or two ways depending on the person.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:28]** Like they could have garments that they're wearing and they put the armor over or they could be in their commando style and just wear the armor.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:31]** I think it's more of a personal thing than it is like a cultural thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:42]** But I mean, they are, I don't think that they're going to be wearing clothes that they would like necessarily wear out per se, you know, they might, they might get them soon or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:43]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:45]** There's gotta be like something under there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** I mean, sure.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:48]** But I would expect like long Johns.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** Oh, not sure.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** Not like a flight suit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:57]** Uh, here's wants to take this armor, John, because my armor sucks or I should say his does.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** So, uh, here's, it's going to roll a sleight of hand.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Check.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** It's 15.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** Does that work?

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** To take their armor off?

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** That's really a problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:11]** Sorry, you want to, while Kaniko is behind you, take off their armor stealthily and put it on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:18]** Here's does that, plus he's going to also do a bluff check and tell her, look over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** I'm asking if that's what you want to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:26]** Yeah, that's what he wants to do, but he also rolls a bluff check and he's just like, hey, could you... I'm sorry, I'm really trying to win this, so...

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:31]** He's like, can you, like, go all the way down the hall, Kaniko?

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** I thought I saw that body squirming over there.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:35]** Could you please check while I check to see if Orgot's okay?

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** It's a 19, Jon.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** So you rolled a 15.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:40]** 19 bluffs, though.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** And 15 sleight of hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:42]** It's a 19 bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:45]** Okay, is this light armor or heavy armor?

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** It's light armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** It's freebooter armor one.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:48]** It's light.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** Sure, I'll go check.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:53]** But you, the bluff, she's like, okay, I'll go check.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:56]** But she is not, like, convinced.

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:00]** Like, she sees you undoing the armor.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:03]** So that is, that's your Achilles tendon here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:05]** She just turns around and Achilles is wearing it.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** And he's like, hey, like, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:12]** Well, it takes time to take it off and then you to take off armor and then you to put it on.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:15]** So as you're starting to undo armor, here's drags.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** Hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:21]** Because I hate this idea, but I want to play the rules as written.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:27]** It takes four rounds to don or remove light armor if a round is six seconds.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:34]** He could, in theory, do both in eight rounds, which is, what, 48 seconds?

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:35]** Yeah.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** So if he could distract her for a minute...

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:42]** It's doable, man.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:44]** He will have pulled it off, rules as written.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** This is so good.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:51]** This is a terrible idea, but I want to play it out by the rules.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:58]** I think Rick is oblivious to what's happening, and he's just going to step past you and squeeze past Kaniko.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:03]** And he's marching just down the hall with his pulse caster rifle up.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:08]** And he's heading towards that elevator, and he's almost standing guard in case something else comes down.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:11]** And he's like, I need to take a break.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** I'm going to take a breather.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:17]** But he's taking a breather almost out of tension while...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:38]** keeping an eye on this but I'm going to take a 10 minute rest unless anybody objects I like that here's okay so let's just as we're going because Will has had his hand up so Rick19 is walking down the hallway we're still in the middle of here's the situation creating a situation we'll resolve that in a second Will

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** What are you doing?

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:41]** Because I saw your token.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:51]** has already gone to the elevator and he's going to go try and get his relax you back from Orgot's bunk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:53]** Are you going on your own to a different level?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:58]** I mean, yeah.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:58]** Okay.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** Fuck these guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** I'm going to a different bar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:06]** I really want my thing back.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Okay.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:11]** There's still one more pike running around the ship.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:14]** And potentially Gray's on board, for all we know.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Just saying.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** This is true.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** Just putting that in your head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** This is true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** This is a bonanza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** This is wild.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** Dr.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:24]** O.K., you head into the elevator.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:25]** Yeah.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:29]** Rick19, you probably see the elevator starting to go down as you're walking.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** Because I'm imagining a lot of this is happening concurrently.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:33]** And he raises his gun up.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** He's just like... And I'm unpaused.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** He doesn't realize Dr. O.K.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:36]** is up there.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:40]** I've unpaused foundries, so Dr.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** O.K., you are in the elevator right now.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:43]** Yeah.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:47]** Yeah, and you're going to go down to the lower deck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:53]** Yeah, I have the needler pistol equipped with the knockout.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:53 - 00:38:14]** okay the elevator descends and you see yes but hold on hold on the elevator descends and you see that there is a red emergency light the same that is showing in the rest of the hallways and everything is quiet what do you do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:18]** Okay, so Bernice is going to go.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:22]** And let me just deselect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** I'm so nervous for you, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:25]** So Bernice goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** I can't even see what's happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** Is to relax you in the bunk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** So what does Bernice do?

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:37]** You're moving a lot, and I'm asking you to give me a little bit step-by-step.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** Are you walking up, and does Bernice open the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:44]** Dr. Okay is in the...

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** In the hallway.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** Okay.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:55]** Telling Bernice to check the bunk, and he's outside with the needle or pistol, checking the corners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:58]** Okay.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:06]** Bernice goes in, and Bernice sees that the relax you is sitting on Orgat's bed, which is the bed on the left.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:06]** Great.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:09]** Paint on Foundry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:29]** uh bernice can't really pick it up herself i'm imagining uh so i'm gonna take some quick little step in and step out and we're gonna head back onto the elevator that's the plan okay okay so you're walking collide okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** Walk in.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** You walk in.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** You see the relax you.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:34]** Grab it.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** You go over and grab it.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** And that's where we're going to cut for you for right now.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:40]** Let's go back to Colin.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:44]** What are you doing while you hear he is talking?

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** You don't know where Dr. O.K.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:50]** is and you just saw Rick19 walk by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Nope.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** Colin is squishing in Dr.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** O.K.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:54]** 's slime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:56]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:27]** I mean I think at this point he's just waiting to see like what the next shoe to fall is because to this point he's just been attacked at every turn so like eyes wide weapon ready where's the next threat coming from but right now he's somewhere relatively well shielded I think he would like to take a break so if there is a 10 minute like does Colin get the impression that this is a time to take a rest


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** Great question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:30]** I don't know what I would roll to check that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** I don't think that you would roll.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** It's a good question.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:39]** I think you know that Orvier Pike is the only member of the crew unaccounted for currently.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:41]** Yeah.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:55]** And don't forget there is the potential and there's the knowledge that you have not moved because a gray ship is probably outside.

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:07]** That's the only way that you are still unable to move is if putting together the fact that you were abducted by greys and that they have a drift shadow projector as Dr. Okay.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** So I'm going to let Colin decide.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:13]** I don't know what Colin would rank as pressure or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:19]** Can I roll a mysticism check to better understand the drift shadow projector?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:24]** Hit me with that mystic roll.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:29]** That is a natural 20 for a 35.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Wow.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** Dang.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:40]** So since it's a mysticism check.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Yeah.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:45]** And not necessarily a technical engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Because he's useless in those areas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:48]** Right.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:51]** So you're just trying to recall, like, what's your question?

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** You definitely knocked it out of the park.

**[00:41:54 - 00:42:00]** So I want to give you whatever it is that you're trying to look for from whatever angle Colin's looking at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:19]** I think he's trying to understand the underlying magic behind this tractor beam, effectively, to come up with an idea of how to defeat it and what they need to do next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** Got it.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:27]** Mystically, you... Because the only way... The drift is a mystic plane, right?

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:31]** I mean, it's technical, but it's also bestowed by deities.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:36]** So I'm assuming there's some magic there for him to tap into.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Sure.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:48]** I'll say that the shadow projector prevents a drift engine from working in the way that you want it to.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:59]** It's a little bit like if you take a motor that's maybe designed and you take it out of water and it's designed for a boat and you put it in air and it's not going to generate enough force.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:13]** Yeah, and so the shadow that is projected from this onto the ship, to escape that shadow, you need to literally leave the shadow.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:15]** It is currently holding you in the shadow.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:20]** And typically they are used to prevent entering or exiting the drift.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:27]** They have also been known to control the drift engine as a whole, so it makes sense that for greys.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:32]** that they are able to modify and use it in ways that are novel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:34]** Got it.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:50]** Then I guess Colin would probably say, it looks like we need to make our way to the bridge to get this ship moving somewhere else so we can get out from the shadow of this projector, get the drift engine working again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** Will that require anybody in the engine room?

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:57]** Or do you think the bridge has full control currently?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:00]** I think that's a great question that we won't know the answer to until we get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:04]** Before we leave this floor, I do think we should bind all of these pikes.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:10]** It's not that... I fear that they might still be under the influence of whatever it was.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** I agree with that.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** The greys.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** We know it's the greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** We might be able to lock them in one of these rooms as well.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** Maybe the prison?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** That is a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:22]** There's a brig.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** Let's just lock them in the brig.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:24]** All right, let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:29]** I do agree that we need to lock them in the brig.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:32]** It's probably best to make sure that they don't come at us.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Strip them with their armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** Yeah, let's strip them with that.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:37]** That's an important thing to do as well.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** It's probably more comfortable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** She's going to turn around.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:45]** In case we need some backup, I'd say we should leave their armor on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:48]** Let's say no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** Let's say no to that.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:56]** Kanika turns around and sees you wearing Orgoth's armor, which very clearly has a lot of phrasmo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:56]** It says Orgoth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:00]** It says Orgoth now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** It says Mel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** It has the Pyke's peritons.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:11]** And she turns around and she says, like, are you wearing Orgoth's armor, Piers?

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:15]** And then looks and sees, and you know it's rhetorical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** Let's do another bluff check.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** I'm a Pyke's Parachute.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:23]** What are you talking about?

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** It's a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** What do you say?

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:29]** I was actually part of the Pyke's Parachutes at one point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** What do you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** Here's the situation.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:39]** Or God and I, you know, the first night that I was on this ship, you know, she and I were talking, hanging out.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** We're going to watch that.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:43]** We're in the, you know, the cafe or whatever you call it here.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:48]** Uh, and, uh, you know, she and I became like really, really close, really close buds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:51]** So we decided to like get our names written on each other's armor.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:56]** And, uh, I have organs and she has, uh, she has hairs on hers.

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:01]** And he just kind of like covers her body slightly with his foot to like prevent.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** He summons Chad and then has Chad just drag her away into the room.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** So she can't like, you know, sleep dead.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:42]** oh my god i can see that orgot is not wearing any armor yeah i mean that's probably why she went down so easily i think she didn't want like the armor to get all messed up with my name on it we were pretty close that one night i mean not in a not in that kind of way but you know like she walks up to you and she puts her hand on your shoulder

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** Here's sweat rolls down his back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:51]** If a bug can sweat, he's doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:54]** She says, I'm not mad.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** I'm just disappointed.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:01]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:07]** Why didn't you just say that you needed better armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** I don't know what you're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** It's okay.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:15]** I don't know what you're talking about.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:16]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:16]** Okay.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** He's so committed to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:20]** You're going to have to give it back.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:20]** Okay.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:24]** But for now, I hope it protects you.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:24]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:27]** And she taps you on the shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:32]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:33]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** It's okay.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:40]** And she picks up Orgott and lays Orgott into the bed that is on there.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:42]** John, here's the thing.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** I think I made a mistake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** Because... What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:48]** It's worse armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:51]** Because the Kasata microcord...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:02]** It has environmental protections, right?

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:06]** They all have environmental protections.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:08]** I'm keeping it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:12]** He's like, I wasn't lying as he strips it off.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:16]** Just leaves it on the floor.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** Oh, my God.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** Oh, my God.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:24]** I can't.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** I just can't.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:28]** I just can't.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** That just happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:34]** Let's go back to Dr. Okay.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:40]** You are standing in the...

**[00:48:41 - 00:49:04]** bedroom of orgot and torv in their quarters and you pick up the relax you you look you're like yep this is this is mine right where i left it right right where it was left do you put it on do you do i use it for 10 minutes no okay all right i just wanted it back


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:10]** I was really disappointed that I had to come get it.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** I'm all alone.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:16]** Well, here's what's changing his armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:20]** You're standing there thinking this.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:24]** Maybe you hear in the comms, here's trying to make an excuse.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:28]** You're picturing what's happening in your head.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:29]** I'm shaking my head.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:32]** And then there's a

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:52]** The sound of something is coming from the... Cafeteria.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** Can I discern where it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Whole lot of notes down there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:02]** You think that it is... Sounds a little bit like it's a Brutaris match.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** Oh...

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** I don't know.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:10]** Bernice is going to head over to the elevator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** It's Orvier.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:17]** Nope.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:21]** Orvier's watching the game.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** entranced by the grains.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:25]** He's just sitting there with the remote in his hand and a beer in the other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:28]** Just watching the game.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:30]** Um... Dr.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:30]** O.K.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:33]** 's gonna peek out into the hallway.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** Does he see anything?

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:38]** He's got the needle or pistol trained towards the cafeteria.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** I love this image of Dr. Okay.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** Just by himself.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:43]** And it's like, try trying to go get what Dr. Okay wants.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:44]** Yeah.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:48]** And then like being tactical, but it's like, there's no one else there.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** It is a dead Bernice.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:50]** Yeah.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:54]** But like, there's, if I die, I die.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** If he dies, he dies.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** You don't see anybody else there.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:09]** You do see off to your left, you see the light like you see a TV when you're not in the room, and you can't see the TV, but you can see the light dimming and changing.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Yeah.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:16]** And you can see that down the hall, and you can hear a little bit better that it sounds like a Brutaris match.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:16]** Okay.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:22]** I'm going to head up to the main deck.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** It's smart.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** Hey, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:29]** We might want to clear the lower deck.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:31]** We should all do it together if we go to there.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** If there's only one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:35]** I got a little sheepish.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:39]** But we don't know this is happening, apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** What do you think?

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:43]** You said that over the comms?

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:46]** No, I'm in the room now with you.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** Oh, hi, Doc.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:57]** As the elevator comes down, Rick's got his gun just trained on it, and when the door's open, he's got his finger on that trigger, but he sees it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:01]** We've established, though, it's like a platform that just floats up.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:02]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:07]** Rick didn't notice you go up in the first place.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** He thought you were back in the room.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:12]** So he thought you were still in the room.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:16]** As that elevator moves, he's like, and then sees you and stops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:20]** I got my relax you back.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:27]** We want to take a rest, but we should probably clear the galley.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:34]** I think either there's a Brutaris match going on or some wacky stuff.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Hey, let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:38]** What are you speaking of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:45]** I was downstairs, and the Brutaris match is back on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:50]** Did it come on suddenly, or it's just been on since...

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** It wasn't on before, right, John?

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:56]** Yeah, somebody turned it on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Let's go find out what happened.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:02]** I, here, as a friend of Orgott, agree that we should go together to meet this threat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:05]** Maybe somebody is still...

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:18]** on the ship not insane, but also maybe they are insane and they're just watching the Brutaris match because of, I don't know, whatever glitchy thing.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:21]** They don't have anything to attack right in their immediate area.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** Who knows?

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** Who knows?

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Let's go find out.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** Who knows?

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** Should we find out?

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:34]** Should we just call the... Is there an intercom that we can use maybe instead?

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:38]** I don't think alerting them to our presence would be a good idea.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:46]** What if we can pretend like we are one of the pikes and convince them that the ship is all clear?

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:50]** I can possibly try to simulate their voices.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:56]** I think the five of us would probably be able to handle whatever individual would be in there.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:00]** Since there's only one crew member accounted for, we can assume it's probably them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:05]** I could perhaps use my armor with Orgoth's name to try to, you know, like, fool them.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:06]** It's possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:10]** You're talking about your original armor?

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** No, it's my armor with the name that she put on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:14]** The armor you traded for?

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:17]** It's lower than each other's names.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** I heard over the combs.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** And I told you.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:25]** Anyway, my story was true, and I can use my armor to fool them.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** potentially.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:34]** I love that the assumption is that they wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a female orc and a male Shiren.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:38]** Because of the armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:41]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** We could do something.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:45]** I'll tell you what.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:49]** Here's has a plan to try to fool them.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:51]** And if that doesn't work, we can fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** I can't wait to see this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:54 - 00:55:03]** All right, so you all put Hesper and Ludvaia and Torv and...

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:30]** strip their weapons bound them up and put them in the brick yep okay and we piled up their weapons um next to the elevator platform got it put them underneath one of the the the chairs there so it's like not in the open okay sorry let me get that again so you said that you put their weapons and armor in the chairs underneath near the lounger under the chair okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** Okay.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** Like, half-hidden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:36]** We're just trying to figure out if this other individual, if they're in there as a threat, right?

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** So, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:41]** Hey, Kelly, just to clarify, you have Kasatha Microchord?

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** It is less good than what I put on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:45]** No, now he's wearing Freebooter Armor 1.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:50]** It has, like, a 1 plus its higher EAC modifier and higher dex modifier.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** Max dex modifier.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** It is actually better.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Yeah, you're right.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:55]** It is better.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** I have such a low EAC in case I need it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:04]** Kaniko is the last to come out because she was helping just to grab everything.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:05]** Are they locked up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** Yeah.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** They are locked up.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:10]** Door shut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** I feel bad for my bestie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:18]** Kaniko, I think you should stay here and keep watching.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** Let us know if anything happens.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:22]** If they come back awake, we will return and help you.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** Kiriko, please stay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:27]** I can do a bunch of shit without you getting in our way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:33]** I mean, if you don't want my help, that seems kind of counterintuitive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:36]** I think you should have your help.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:38]** Here's the thing.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:43]** We don't know what's in that room, but we know there's one person out accounted for.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:45]** They could be anywhere on the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:55]** If that person were to come down by themselves, let's say they're on the turret or whatever, then she'd be here all alone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:57]** And she can take cover and radio us.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:59]** We will be back up immediately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:07]** Maybe we could leave Meltaman to watch over the inmates and then we can take her with us.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** That's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** I forgot about that.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:11]** Did someone say my name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** Hey, Meltaman.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:14]** We need you to stand guard.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** We have a very important task for you.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:16]** Hey, Orgat.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** How are you?

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** Hey, what's up?

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** What's up, Loptime?

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:22]** God dang it.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** There's no way this is happening.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:28]** Hey, Meltaman.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:30]** Oh, it's not you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:30]** Yeah.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** Did you kill Orgot?

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** Orgot and I are really tight.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:35]** Listen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:37]** Meltaman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:42]** Meltaman, I need you to watch the brig and make sure no one gets out there.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** Okay?

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:43]** Gets out of there.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:47]** You guard that brig and make sure they stay in.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:48]** There you go.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** Just do that.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** All right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:50 - 00:58:11]** melt a man real quick if if you do find someone trying to get out uh give us a call on the comms yeah yeah they might sure they might uh they might be fine they might not but we'd like to find out you good with that melt a man yes kaniko do you agree


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:16]** Yes, yes, please, please, just stay and watch the door.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** All right, here I go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** Why does he need Koneko's confirmation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:22]** I don't know.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** It says 2FA.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** You've got to have, like, your Koneko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** 2FA.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:32]** Koneko is the second in command on the Pyke Spirit.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** So, under Orvir.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:39]** So, Meldaman, for things like this, usually looks to Koneko.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:45]** You got that sense from the way that she generally acts in a leadership role.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:47]** She's opened a lot of things, but she generally acts that way.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:53]** And speaking of Kaniko, she actually looks at all of you and says, let me just check one thing.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** I'm going to open this door.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** This is Orvier's quarters right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** I'm going to check and see if Orvier's in here.

**[00:58:59 - 00:58:59]** Rick?

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:02]** Will you watch my back?

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:08]** Rick is going to move up and behind these chairs to have a direct line of sight into the room.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:10]** You're talking about the door right in front of her?

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:10]** Yes.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:16]** So yeah, Rick is going to step so he's right in line with that door, but as far back as he can.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** Okay.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** She steps off to the side.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** And I've taken ten minutes rest.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:21]** Has everybody else?

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** Who needs to?

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:25]** I'm not going to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:28]** Personally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:28]** Same.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:31]** I'm also really low on RP, just to let y'all know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Yeah, because you're taking three minute rests a lot?

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** Is that why?

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** Because I'm on the verge of death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:39]** A ten minute rest or something.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** Colin, did you take 10 minutes?

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** Do you want the relax you?

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:45]** Oh, okay, but we can heal you, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:46]** Can't we?

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** I think... I'm fine.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:52]** I do want a 10-minute rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** So you took a 10-minute rest.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:57]** You were waiting, so it seemed like that makes sense.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:59]** But I don't know that you would have the relax you because Dr. O.K.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:02]** probably came up towards the end of that, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:04]** I mean, that's what I figured.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:07]** If they were taking a 10-minute rest, I could go

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** Hop off for a minute.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** Yeah, of course.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:13]** Okay, makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:15]** I mean, it did take ten minutes, though.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:19]** I mean, it took like three, maybe like four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:27]** Yeah, but there was just the part at the beginning where you're like, wait, the general sense of like, took, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:28]** Sure.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:35]** I mean, from a meta perspective, I would love to take a long rest at some point soon, but I don't think that's practical right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:37]** I concur with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:39]** She opens the door.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:42]** Rick, you don't see anything.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** There are no lights on.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:51]** You can see that the light from the red light is spilling in, but you don't see much of anything else.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:54]** Bernice is going to move over.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:56]** Okay.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:57]** Keniko walks in.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:00]** Clear.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:02]** I don't see anything here.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** She goes and turns on the light.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** There's no one here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:10]** Rick will move up to where Bernice is standing right in the doorway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:11]** Yeah.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** You look in.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** She's turned on the light.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:16]** It seems like a pretty Spartan room.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:20]** Orvier didn't bring a lot with him.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:27]** But you do see that there's some Brutaris-themed apparel in a notebook.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:29]** Classic, classic Orgon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:30]** Oh, this is Orvir.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]** Never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:33]** My bad.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:35]** What's this other room, by the way?

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** Which room, sir?

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:38]** This one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** Not sure yet.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:40]** You don't know?

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** Should we check this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:46]** Is there a computer terminal in Orvir's room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** Yeah.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:49]** It looks like the same computer terminal that you had in your room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:52]** Okay, so we can't gain any other access from that.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:55]** I don't know if there would be personal files.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:57]** No, it just looks like quarters.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:01]** Can I do a perception check to see if there's anything else in this room?

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:01]** Are we just searching?

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:02]** Is that a question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** We're going to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** We can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:07]** That is 14 total.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** Sorry, what?

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:08]** 13?

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:08]** 14.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:09]** 14.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:10]** Okay.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:12]** Nothing out of the ordinary.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:12]** All right.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:13]** He's checking.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:18]** He goes, like, dips down, checks under the bed, clears kind of everything, and he concurs with Kanika.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:19]** All clear.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** And he's stepped out of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:21]** Okay.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:26]** Are we ready to go down and investigate the cafeteria?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:28]** Should we check this room in front of us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** Are we checking all the rooms?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:29]** Sure.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:32]** I believe that's Ezra's quarters.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:35]** What about this one that I'm in front of?

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:37]** That's Ezra's quarters.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** Okay, I'm going in.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** I see two computer terminals.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:42]** There's a sign from Kanika.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:47]** There's two computer terminals, and then... So it's just like a perception to check to kind of get... Oh, it's just one.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:54]** Yeah, it's just one computer terminal, and then what looks like a bathroom that's inside the room.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:56]** What was this?

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:56]** It's like a stall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:57 - 01:03:00]** This bigger room in the back, I remember briefly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:02]** Sure.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:05]** You can actually see a little bit through.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:07]** It has the glass in the door.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:13]** And you can see a little bit through this blue that's coming through, pulsing in and out.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:16]** And you think that that is the engine room.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:17]** Yeah.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:18]** Did we check all the rooms?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:20]** Yep.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:20]** You didn't.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:24]** Are we going to check all the rooms before we go down?

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:28]** I believe that's... Sure, yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** That's Wooden Hesper's room.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:54]** where's orgott's room i mean i already know that never mind downstairs that's where yeah i knew that i knew that to get the uh this one uh it's just another room oh it's like literally nothing i don't know it's in the room it's fetch's room oh this is the one that i think here's got locked in he's not going in there or maybe i'm wrong but i remember him getting locked that's not the one that you got locked in so we're all standing in the elevator bay and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:59]** Hears slash Orgot is walking and checking all the rooms.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** That's Gnarla's quarters down to the south.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** I'm ready to go.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:02]** Thanks for waiting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:05]** I think it is wise to check the engine room just to be sure.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:06]** All right, I'll do that.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:09]** And he's going to kick the door in.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** That was unnecessary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:12]** Super stealthy.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:14]** Ooh, it's really pretty.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** Oh, look at this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:17]** Yeah, you...

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:22]** Yeah, you see that the engine, the blue seems to be the power core.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:22]** That's beautiful.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:24]** That everything is set up to.

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:25]** There are some terminals around it.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:31]** And then beyond it in purple is the, you recognize this as a typical engine.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:34]** And there's a monitor in front of that in that room.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** It's in a separate room.

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:40]** Off to the right, there's another smaller monitor and desk.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:43]** You think that that's probably where the drift engine controls are.

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:44]** Okay, that's pretty cool.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** What about these?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:51]** Can I do a general engineering check to make sure that there's nothing wrong with the engine and it looks like it's functional?

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:53]** Here's is going to assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:54]** Do an engineering check.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:55]** Hold on one second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** Here's assist.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:57]** 11.

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:59]** Plus 2 from assist.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:02]** Everything seems to be fine.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:04]** I mean, the drift engine is not on.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:08]** I don't know how much you would know about that, but you know that it's not functioning.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:14]** So you probably don't know enough of like the way that it sounds to be able to listen to it.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:16]** You're not that tuned into engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:19]** Well, there's no clear images of sabotage or anything.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** I feel like that would have been useful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:21]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:24]** What about these doors off of the engine room?

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** Kaniko walks in.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:26]** Those are airlocks.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:27]** Oh, okay.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:28]** I didn't open that one.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:28]** See ya.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:30]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:32]** You did open it, but that's okay.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:32]** It's fine.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:33]** It's good.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:37]** It's not... It's pressurized.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:39]** It just puts Orgod in the airlock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** Now you'll never know.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:44]** Oh, goodness.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:46]** You'll never know for sure.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:53]** We'll never know if Orkut is actually a half-orc or has been a shearer this whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:57]** No, it tells you as soon as you eject them if they're an imposter or not.

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:01]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:01]** All right.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:04]** I think I can't go on the same.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:05]** I guess I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:06]** All right, cool.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:06]** I'm ready.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:09]** Should we get on with this?

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:09]** Let's go.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:10]** Hey, Rick.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:12]** Oh, all right.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:13]** Where are we going?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:13]** How do I?

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:15]** Oh, there it goes.

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:16]** Lower deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]** Lower deck.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:18]** All right.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:21]** So you all enter the lower deck.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:24]** Kaneko looks ready for action.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:33]** As soon as you come down, you do hear the sounds of a Brutaris match at the end of the cafeteria.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** Colin draws his needler pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:35]** Rick moves forward.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:38]** I'll take lead.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:39]** Okay.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:41]** You all started walking down the hall.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:42]** So you're walking down the hall.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:44]** Rick, 19, is taking lead.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:45]** Quietly.

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:46]** Yep.

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:47]** Bernice seems to be taking lead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** I line up at the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:50]** Okay.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:52]** Rick, 19, you line up

**[01:06:53 - 01:07:20]** at the door you're about to look in you can see now when you're looking at a tv from the off angle you can see kind of what's on it right and you're able to to see what appears to be people running punching diving you can see the banner of the tickers you know there are different other games going on and sports it you were the only one who watched this here no one else watched this match

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:27]** It seems like it is the same match from before.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:40]** But you can see a little off to your left that there is some sort of figure lower to the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:46]** And that's our game.

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:46]** No!

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:49]** No!

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:50]** What could it be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:55]** Find out next time on Dragon Ball Z. Hi, new friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:57]** Hi, new friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:07:57 - 01:08:00]** It's the Skinner Brothers crossover.

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:00]** Oh, God.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:01]** What?

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:04]** It's the crossover episode.
