## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:56]** Do we want to...

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:00]** Do we want to explain the Anonymous Hamster reference?

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** Yeah, that's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** I scored some more of this Erotic City beer.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** My friends had some extra.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:11]** It's the one that's never going to be made again.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:13]** Oh, that's nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** You know what I'm excited about?

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** What?

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:18]** In a few short weeks, we're all going to be in the same room.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** And Kelly just remembered to book a flight to Indiana.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:32]** He's looking at flights now.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** You think he booked it already?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:37]** He's going to book it on July 31st, man.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:38]** I know.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** I'm really bad.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:43]** I book flights like three days before is like the maximum amount of like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:46]** He's going to show up at a Greyhound like three days later.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** After July.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:48 - 00:03:10]** i really wanted to take the amtrak was what i wanted to take but then like it's it's it's not worth it you can do it you could you can take the train all the way there basically it goes from from california west or east wow there's not much west of california it goes from california east through what kansas to i don't know missouri


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** I forget.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:14]** You're not looking at anything pleasant other than corn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:17]** No, you're going through the Rockies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** That corn is pretty pleasant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:27]** But once you get past the Rockies, you're going to forget your wallet in the last town before you get to a whole flat area.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:32]** And then you're going to drive back, and then you're going to go back again through flat corn and wood area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** I just don't want to go on a flight.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** I was thinking maybe I'll take a boat around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** Shortly after getting a speeding ticket, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** I don't know.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Mississippi River Cruise.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** The Panama Canal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:50]** Only one of the most important trade routes in the world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:54]** One-way train from LA to Indianapolis is only $220.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** That's not bad.

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:00]** Is that business class?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** No, that's basic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:06]** I would want to do a room basically because you'd be there for a week.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** It'd take a while.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** But it wasn't worth it.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:12]** It was like five times the cost of like a... Yeah, it's a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:21]** Well, just don't buy it on June 26th because that's... It's normally $350 and then it jumps up to $1,000 for one day according to their average prices.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** I'm super excited for this job.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** Good.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** I'm also excited.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:34]** If you can't tell by my sickly voice.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** Dude, I'm so sorry that you're sick.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:40]** I wish that you weren't, but it's okay.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** Yeah.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** Sorry, buddy.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** First question.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:48]** If you had to live in a cage for the rest of your life, would you rather the bars be horizontal or vertical?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** What the fuck?

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:49]** Vertical.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** What kind of question is that?

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Oh, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** Oh, it's not the positioning that you're in.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** It's like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:54 - 00:06:16]** where are the horizontal bars who has horizontal bars no one so that's why i guess animals do so maybe this is like i would go horizontal so i could climb them okay easier i would want glass so i didn't know i was actually contained that's a good idea yeah i feel like there's a lot of clarifying questions yeah how big is this cage the question was simple


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:19]** Do you want the bars to be vertical or horizontal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** I want like a moat that I can't swim across.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:23]** Instead of bars.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** To keep me from the barrier that is keeping me inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** What are the bars made of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** Are they metal?

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** That's why it's like a false barrier.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** Because I don't feel like the barrier is the barrier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** It's the moat that's the barrier.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:36]** If anybody who is unsure about what it's like to GM, this is what it's like to GM.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** It's to ask a simple question.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:41]** And get every possible response back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:48]** I'm really interested in a Japanese wood latticework impossible frame cage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:48]** Alright, alright.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:50]** I have four total.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:50]** That was the first one.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** Next one, pretty easy.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:52]** Softball.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** Best friends with Batman or Superman?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** Batman, 100%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:01]** Because Batman's a billionaire?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:07]** Or because he's... Bruce Wayne or Batman?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Superman lives in a tiny apartment.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:10]** It wouldn't be fun to hang out with him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** Yeah, I agree with Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:14]** You'd rather have a house with a giant f***ing igloo?

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** What are we saying here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:21]** Yeah, I would be friends with Superman because he's from fucking like Krypton, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** It doesn't exist anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** Yeah, but John, I need to know.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:27]** Right.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:30]** I mean, can I also be friends with Bruce Wayne?

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:31]** Cool.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** Then yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** No, you can't say both.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:33]** That's not fair.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:34]** What?

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:34]** How are you?

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** Bruce Wayne.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:38]** You're saying Bruce Wayne over Superman.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:38]** Okay.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:38]** Yeah.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** I'm Bruce Wayne over Superman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:39]** Gotcha.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:40]** Yeah.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** 100% Bruce Wayne.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:57]** like he's he's the dc um um oh i lost his name iron man billionaire like he's much darker much grittier like yeah not really playboy you know what i'm saying no no yes

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:00]** I just assume he gets around.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:01]** Bruce Wayne is.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:02]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:04]** Or he has his moments where he plays around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:07]** 100%.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:15]** His genius business mogul martial arts enthusiast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:20]** Who are seeing individuals who would want to befriend an alien.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:24]** I feel like it's... I'm going to have more fun with...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:28]** I feel like you would get access to, like, the Justice League at some point in that friendship.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** So, like, there's, like, three aliens on Justice League now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:34]** And even if Superman went crazy, there's some... Like, you know Batman has kryptonite that could take Superman down.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:36]** So... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** That instant... Nothing can take out Batman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** Just saying.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:40]** Nothing.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:41]** Ah, yeah.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:42]** I forgot about that.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** One wrinkle.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:45]** All right.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** I have...

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** That was question two.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:47]** Question three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:55]** The Tome of Knowledge just from the Kryptonian message.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:57]** I would just want to be friends with Superman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:01]** So, yeah, follow-up question for me and my Batman friends.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Which Batman?

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** We'll say Michael Keaton.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** We'll talk movies.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:09]** We'll say George Clooney.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** We'll say Christian Bale.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:12]** Christian Bale.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** Or... The animated one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** Ben Affleck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** The animated one is pretty dark.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** Definitely not Ben Affleck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:22]** I can't remember the actors in the... He's not Batman, though.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** The animated series?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:31]** Yeah, I mean, the Batman Beyond is an entirely different, like... Yeah, it's a different guy.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** The Caped Crusader?

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** I don't know.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** I would go with the animated series for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:42]** If we're talking friends, though, now we're talking, like, do I want to have fun or do I want to, like, just have a good friend?

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:46]** I feel like Batman's the kind of friend... George Clooney and Val Kilmer's, like, they were more fun...

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:19]** Because I feel like Kev just taking notes in the corner would be a really good assignment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:24]** See, that's how I feel.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:26]** Yeah, it's so bad, but it's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:29]** Note, Salsa Verde gives me the runs.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:33]** I want Kev to spell Guayabera.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Oh, shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** I don't have to know.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:40]** Benny is wearing a guacamole capybara shirt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:43]** Guacamole capybara.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Guava?

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** Guava?

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:52]** Guava bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** It's a guava bear.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:57]** Guy Ferreira.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:01]** Guy Ferreira.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** I'm so sorry.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** I'm so sorry, dude.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** I'm so sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:08]** Feel free to veto this whole thing.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:11]** All right, fourth question.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:13]** We also might need to cut this question, but I liked it too much.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:19]** Every time that you have an orgasm, the song All Star by Smash Mouth plays.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:24]** That's option A. Or every time the song All Star by Smash Mouth plays, you have an orgasm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:30]** I'm locked in on this one.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:33]** I want A, and I want to start on the third verse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:45]** Yeah, I would do A. I can't live in a world where... I keep up with alternate stads or chorus for that.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:49]** It was, hey, now you're a porn star, take your clothes off and get laid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:51 - 00:13:06]** that's a hard choice though like because i don't know if i hear that song often enough to get okay i feel like most people don't want to play it so you won't have an orgasm that often while like listening that's like you know what i mean people avoid playing that song like yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:26]** how because you get you already get orgasms from is what you're saying how loosely so people are openly not playing it to stop you from having orgasms that's just rude but like you could do how loosely interpreted are these rules right because like i feel like your fork play could be like instrumental versions of all-star and like slow like as you build it up to

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:32]** Yeah, option A. And then, you know, if you go see Smash Mouth in concert, just like boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** No one would ever do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:40]** All three people that would be at that concert would be orgasming the entire time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Well, that's the question.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:43]** Is it like, is it just one of us?

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** Is it all five of us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** Steve Harwell died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** The lead singer of Smash Mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:48]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:54]** Yeah, right after he had a racist meltdown at a concert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:57]** The lead singer from Journey died and they're still touring.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:59]** They just found some room in the Philippines.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:01]** That's weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** He tried out, man.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** Did you see his audition tape?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** Dude, his video is...

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:35]** mind-blowingly good yeah it's oh that's good you should you should watch that i mean it sounds highly recommended yeah yeah 100 dude cooks for sure dude cooks um all right cool so i just couldn't imagine like the five of us making eye contact as they start the song to each other while we're working like that is that what you're saying yeah that's the only thing and then all of a sudden the song comes on and you see five guys go oh

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** All right.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:39]** I'm glad that we have that there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:45]** I'm glad we let the internet know about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** Question for you, John.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:48]** Where did these questions come from?

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** Are you been like... We came from Finder.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Thanks, Finder.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** Wait, Finder came up with those?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** No, no.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** Okay, good lord.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:00]** I only came up with the...

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** AI Kevin won.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:09]** The rest were just from looking in deep spots because you can't just Google would you rather questions because the first like 10 links are all like PC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:16]** I just wanted to know, John, are you like experiencing some hypnotherapy with like Smash Mouth in the background?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:18]** Yeah.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:24]** As soon as I go off video, I just turn off all the lights and it's just me and Smash Mouth.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Orgasm after orgasm.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** Okay.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:26]** All right.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:28]** That was...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:31]** And with that, let's play.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:34]** Let's get back into it.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:34]** What?

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:37]** Let's get back into it.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** That was the foreplay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** Let's play All-Star one last time.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** Let's all be stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:44]** Let's all be stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** We all go to the bar and touch tunes.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:50]** It's just All-Star over and over and over again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:54]** All right.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:54]** All right.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:56]** Back to it.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** Good stuff.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** Good stuff.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** That's exactly what I thought it would be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:00]** All right.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:01]** Bringing it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** Going to center.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:05]** Lock in.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Lock in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:12]** Hey, now.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** The years start coming and they don't start coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:18]** And they don't stop coming.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:18]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:23]** Title of the episode.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** Right there.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:28]** Title of the episode.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** Oh my god.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** I can't tell if Kelly really liked that or at least somewhat liked that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:36]** I don't know how to feel about it.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:38]** I don't know.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** So I'm just not going to do anything.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** I'm not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:43]** So good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Alright, last time.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** Go play.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:48]** We'll save.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** We're playing.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:49]** Let's play.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:58]** The Exploration for Kaniko Breeze, Rick19, Here's Fabricious, and Dr. OK and Colin Edenbrand.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** Exploration's starting to end.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:04]** The prep, escape plan prep, started to begin.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:16]** In the chapel, Kaniko and Hears relinquished the emotional burden from the statue of Iomide by removing the shroud from the statue.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:18]** And all of you felt lighter.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:26]** The two of you discover and take several religious items in the chapel.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:44]** including a rare physical copy, a physical book called The History and Future of Humanity, written by the dead or simply vanished God Erudit.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:48]** Let's talk about those other items real quick because we didn't really go into that last time.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** You found a couple things.

**[00:17:50 - 00:18:08]** You found a star stone compass, which is a small clockwork navigational device that hones in on the mystical signals emitted by the star stone resting at the heart of Absalom Station.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:13]** So you get a bonus to piloting checks when astrogating throughout the Packed Worlds system.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:14]** Pretty sweet.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:20]** And it lets you know exactly where Absalom Station is in relation to your current location at any moment.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:20]** Pretty sweet.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:24]** Number two, Zero Knife.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:32]** Zero Knife is like a switchblade, but the hilt is a bit bulkier because there's a battery in it.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:38]** And the Zero Knife forms a blade that's pretty much an aura of intense cold.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:43]** So you have a, I believe you have a Hailstorm class.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** The Zero Knife.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** Pretty rad.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:50]** Which was at the, I believe it was the Phrasma Statue.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** one of the weapons for asthma.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:59]** And the third was this long sword that, uh, Kelly picked up.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:05]** And by Kelly, I mean, here's, this is a, I was going to tell you now, Kelly.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:10]** And we'll see when, here's, we'll get to know this.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:15]** It is an axiomatic, wholly-centered longsword.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** Axiomatic.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** Oh, Kevin's typing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:22]** I'm going to let you type that, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:27]** Axiomatic, wholly-centered longsword.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** Axial.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:30]** Yeah, sintered is... Sintered.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:33]** S-I-N-T?

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:39]** Yeah, S-I-N-T-E-R-E-D.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** Sintering is like to weld.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** It's a type of weld.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:45]** Yeah, it's made out of compacted ceramics.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:48]** It's like a durable, finely edged blade.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** That's an engineering term.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** That's what you're doing.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:53]** Okay, cool.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:57]** It does 2D8 instead of 1D8.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** A standard longsword does 1.

**[00:19:59 - 00:19:59]** This does 2.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** The axiomatic weapon.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:05]** Axiomatic is in Starfinder.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:07]** I believe it is along an alignment.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** I'm going to look it up real quick.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** Here we go.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Axiomatic.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** Oh, that was the Pathfinder one.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** I didn't want that.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:19]** I had this up, and then I thought I would be able to look at it quickly.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:19]** Thank you for that.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:20]** Appreciate that.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** That was the wrong drop.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** That was also the wrong drop.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** That was also the wrong one.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:29]** The Axiomatic imbues a weapon with divine energy from a lawful deity.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Hence, Yomide.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:33]** And then holy...

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:48]** works on a weapon uh becomes blessed with divine energy from a good deity so damage from the weapon bypasses dr uh good and it exactly exactly

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:51]** And Evil Undead, Evil Outsiders.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:53]** And Axiomatic does the same thing.

**[00:20:53 - 00:21:02]** It ignores the damage from... The damage bypasses DR Lawful and ignores the energy resistance of Chaotic Dragons and Chaotic Outsiders.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:07]** So it's Lawful and good and centered.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:07]** Pretty sweet.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:13]** And it had the phrase, For Victory, For the Heart.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** etched onto the blade.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:21]** Now, here's in Koneko, you then sneak out, you go into the garage, and that's where you meet Rick.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:24]** You discover that there are several vehicles in this garage, right?

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:29]** There's an all-terrain transport, and there are two police cruisers.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:33]** The police creatures have the capability to hover rather than fly.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:51]** And you discover that in order to prime them for full control over all of this, then you'll need to do several hours of intensive engineering and computer work pretty much throughout the dead of the night and evening there.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:59]** There's nothing to indicate that what you're about to do is easy or without the risk of being caught, though.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:08]** Because as we end, as we ended last time, Rick 19 was about to step outside.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** He's about to leave.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Yeah, about that.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:13]** And I'll bring you guys back to the map.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:22]** Rick 19 is about to step out when he hears the dinging of the shift change.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** They still ring the bell for shift change.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** I guess so.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** Like they're not going to hit everyone on the comms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:30]** Weird.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** Feels like school.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** It feels like that or like a ship or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:38]** So Rick, you open the door as the ding ding announced the shift change.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:41]** And I believe you said you closed the door, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** I tried to.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:42]** I don't know if you let me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** You... I'll say that you went to close the door.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** The door shuts.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:50]** Here's Rick19 and also Kaniko, and I will be Kaniko, obviously.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:54]** You know that people will start walking by any minute now.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:58]** Well, here's his inside.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:00]** So here's his, like... He's invisible.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:02]** I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:18]** yeah yeah he's just gonna okay so you just stand there okay that's fine that's fine no i'm going behind the can you go come here come here let's sneak over here and hide behind this ship this canico runs over to hide behind the police cruiser


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:22]** What are these items in the front?

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:24]** Are they big enough to provide cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:24]** Yeah.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** You could probably crouch down behind those, too.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:27]** Are they crates or something?

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:28]** Yeah.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:35]** There are these crates and carts that are scattered around the floor between the door and where the vehicles are.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** And so you can hop in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** Rick will step behind one of those.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:46]** And he's actually going to keep his sheath array on.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** Because it gives him a bonus to stealth.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** What does the two-thread do?

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:55]** It's one of the three options for nanosite.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:56]** Okay.

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:00]** Basically, it just creates a sheath of nanites.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:04]** And this one gives you a plus one to athletics and stuff.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:06]** I think you can choose it every time.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:06]** I forget.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** I have to look up.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:11]** I've had it engaged since we... Kev, read the rules.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:11]** I did.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:14]** Like, two months ago when I turned it on.


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:45]** uh but yeah anyways so okay uh yeah as a move action i can change that into my other nice arrays so okay okay dr k and so here's and uh rick 19 and kinuko run to hide to lay low for a second dr k and colin what do you do all right and that's um that's how i replaced it and kissed his third middle carpool with a with a pen tube it's a crazy story uh what


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:47 - 00:25:16]** we should be quiet oh sorry sorry sorry do you all do you think that you would know that that was a shift change you've probably heard it probably heard the ding and like we're on comms so we yeah yeah so you're like ready to go and probably stoop down behind the table at that comment okay and dr windows there's windows on these doors because i just saw you move somebody in the hallway are there there are there are those little blue lights right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:20]** Yeah, there are windows in the door to the garage.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:24]** There are not windows into the doors of the warehouse, if I remember right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:35]** So Rickle, like, hiding behind the crates, he sees somebody walk past the doors, and he'll, in the comms, whisper, like, what the f*** is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:37]** I saw another species.

**[00:25:37 - 00:26:01]** and he's amazed by it here's like oh my god here's just like wow what's going on lord of the rings or something yeah wait so question what what do you all see because the door is shut so what are you seeing as players on we see some something every moving through the hallway we see a token move uh you see like the edges of a token

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:27]** no i just saw like a full person or something i they had like ears or you know what i mean there's some kind of animal looking thing yeah bring it back do you see anybody now no no okay what what about if i move now surprise no it's when you come right there what is it what oh it's a fucking patra what about yeah it's the patra that we talked to yes oh okay but still i'm really excited i still see it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:30]** I think it's because you're within view of the... It's like a pathway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:32]** I don't see anything, John.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:36]** It's because the doors to where we're at don't have windows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:41]** Even though there's blue indicating that there's windows?

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** What's the blue?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** It's weird because you shouldn't be able to see it.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:47]** That's a side note for a separate thing.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** Technically, you can.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** It makes sense.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:53]** That was not by design, but we'll take a look at that later.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Now it's gone.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:01]** So we only see it for like the seven squares in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:03]** Got it.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:03]** Okay.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** Okay.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:04]** Cool.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:04]** Cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** So Colin and Dr.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:11]** O.K., you can at least hear some of these things happening.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** You can hear people moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:13]** Yeah.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** Oh, it's not the potter anymore.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** Rick shouts into his cops.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:22]** Shouts and makes a bunch of noise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:25]** So you know that there's movement going on out here.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:30]** People are starting to... Occasionally you'll hear a voice come by, a little muffled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:37]** Are they... Not necessarily in a... No, just... It sounds like a Tchaikovsky.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** Stop with it.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** Kind of like little ding-a-ling-ding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:42]** It's like pirouetting down the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:44]** Yeah, it's like a ballet song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** To Cal's base on ice.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** Okay.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:53]** You wait maybe five, ten minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:53]** What's that?

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:56]** Oh, it's a frog person now.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** Why are there so many different animals?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:02]** If you wanted to know about... I saw a frog person walk by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** It's Gullah Gullah.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:06]** Oh my god, I love that show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:13]** The big part about this whole thing is that it's John actually having to change the characters, but he has to move them through the hallways.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:21]** I don't think John intended to drag PCs or NPCs through the hallways.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:24]** He just didn't expect us to see them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** We're like in an Animal Crossing game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** It's actually perfect that I think that here's a record.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:30]** You can see them because you do have the windows.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:37]** So for a brief second, it makes sense that if you were kind of looking over your shoulder, you could see somebody walking through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:39]** Yeah, that reminds me of a really good song I heard on Spotify the other day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:40]** Don't even.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:46]** So... Don't even.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** You wait for just a few minutes.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** And then...

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:55]** It's quiet for now.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:57]** You know that it's around 7 p.m.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Shift changes happened.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:01]** I'm going to move the time forward about 15 minutes.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:13]** Rick is going to cautiously stand up and walk in between the cars, keeping an eye on that door, kind of backtracking.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:23]** Just that he's within earshot, and his helmet's down, and he's going to tell Kaniko and Gears, like, so what is the plan now?

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** Are you two staying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:26]** Yeah.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:30]** Yeah, we're still on for the plan to get the vehicles prepped for tomorrow night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** We are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** Yeah.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** So that's what we're doing.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** Should I stay with you?

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** Rick, you're welcome to stay.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** I can't see you.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:39]** No, I guess you're really stealthy.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** You're invisible.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:40]** Where are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:44]** I think you're visible now, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:48]** I forget what his nanopower was.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** Are you invisible or hidden?

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** No, I'm not invisible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** I think your invisibility ended, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:53 - 00:30:18]** kelly uh yeah i have one more shot at it but for now i'm i thought they used both no i used both last time oh three cool yeah uh gets in the truck and starts messing around with like the way it sits adjusting can we go let's just let rick uh keep himself occupied he's kind of like a child sometimes so just like that and we're gonna we're gonna work on this okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:23]** So then Rick is going to switch his comms back on and talk to Dr. Okay and Colin.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:26]** Are you two okay on your own tonight?

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:29]** I think I might stay here with them just in case something happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:33]** We'll stay nearby unless...

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:39]** we need to make an appearance somewhere, but then it would be weird if not all of us there were there, right?

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** Or maybe not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:55]** I do not think that is necessary for you to stay nearby, but I think it might be useful for you to make separate appearances throughout the halls during the evening.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:57]** Just so you all... Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** Is Kaniko on your comms?

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** Can we help you?

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** Is she on your comms?

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:06]** I would say no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** I would say no.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:12]** She's going to look at you, Rick, and be like, can I say something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:20]** And then Rick will do his hand signals and be like, 726 is like an open channel.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:23]** And he'll tell the rest of them, turn to channel 726.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:27]** Hey, is this everybody?

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:27]** Is this Dr. O'Keefe?

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:29]** Yeah, I can hear you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Oh, hey, wow.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:32]** I got you loud and clear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:34]** These are nice communicators coming in nice and clear.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** Colin, I didn't hear.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** Are you also on the line?

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:38]** I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:45]** Feel his cheeks blushing through the comms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** What do you need?

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:52]** What do you want?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:57]** By the way, Canico, Colin's communication skills are very good.

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:01]** He's very communicative and he watches out for us.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:05]** When he says he's going to be gone, he gives us a horn.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** He's an all-star.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:36]** sorry i just want to make sure we're all here hey look i heard you talking about you know should dr okay and colin should you stay nearby keep in mind that they do have i believe they they have somebody come patrol so just we all need to be wary of that that was all i wanted to do that okay in that case i think we should skedaddle what do you say colin um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:40]** Yeah, I was wondering how long that video would cover us for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:46]** I think it's just for one hour looped forever, basically, right?

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Yeah, that was my understanding.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:53]** Well, I mean, one can only play a game for so long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:57]** I mean, have you played Terraforming Agaton?

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** The doctor's not wrong.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** The doctor's not wrong.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:09]** And this is the advanced expansion pack.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** All right.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:10]** Say enough.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** Say enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** Let's head back to the- But let's head back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** To Rekia.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** Okay.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Okay.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:18]** I mean- Token collide.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:22]** From a metagaming perspective, like, Dr. O.K.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:27]** and Colin are sleeping in the same room, so the video cover is not going to help.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:31]** Were you playing the video now?

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:36]** I thought you were waiting to use that tomorrow when you're going to leave the party.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** Or not go to the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** That's a valid point, Colin.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:44]** I think at that point, I should try to cross the hall and return to my room.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** Here's Kaniko.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Will you be okay here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:48]** Yeah, I'll be fine, man.

**[00:33:48 - 00:34:12]** i mean do we do we should should we maybe i should do this in character should we stagger maybe stagger or could we sneak into the other our colleague's room and um step in to make it look like they're asleep under the covers sure i don't think we should be blankets or whatever crossing this hallway in the restricted area if we do not have to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:21]** And at that point, I think we should either stay in this room or return back and not cross back and forth throughout the night.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:24]** That is increasing risk.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** Or as little as possible, unless absolutely necessary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:31]** Can I close the doors to the warehouse on my way out?

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:33]** Because I don't know how to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:56]** oh there we go oh yeah just left click there we go there you go nice so you all so dr okay and colin start to head back yeah we head back to the hangar and should i join you guys or should should rick stay behind i i think i rick are you able to help with any of this engineering because i can't help yours but i can help fight if it comes to that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:25]** oh okay well uh that's part of my role is to step in and take the fall in case they hear something right because i'm yeah that's so if you can help my yeah go ahead keniko no that's it go ahead yeah so i was gonna say keniko to to rick you uh i can invisibilize myself or whatever but like i don't know how sneaky you are by nature i guess you're really good at like assassinations and so on how are how good it would be yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:31]** My stuff is a plus nine for just like context, but that's a valid point.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:35]** I will return to Dr. OK and Colin and help keep up the ruse outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:38]** And he's going to pronounce the ruse.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:39]** The ruse.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** The ruse.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** The ruse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** I think ruse is.

**[00:35:43 - 00:36:02]** long long ooh long ooh ruse like with a z sound yeah yeah yeah okay so rick approaches the door i'm gonna first do a perception to see if i can see anybody or hear anybody in the hallways 13 plus 7 for a 20


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** Okay.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:09]** 20 would tell you that you don't hear anybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:12]** As his mouse moves over the hallway.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** So Rick opens the door.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** Ooh!

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:18]** But I can see people in the room.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:19]** How many people can you see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** How many people can you see?

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:21]** Oh, Rick just moved out.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** Or Josh just moved out of the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:24]** Yeah, that was just my fault.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** I was going to move them somewhere.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** I didn't mean to.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:31]** Because I got all caught off on what we were doing.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:36]** There is no one in the hallway, but as you open the door, you do think you hear a door opening and then closing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:46]** I'm going to do another perception to see if I can sense where the movement is and if they're approaching or going a different direction.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** It's a natural 20 for 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:54]** It sounded like it was coming up the hallway.

**[00:36:54 - 00:37:02]** You'll remember that when you meandered up innocently, then you saw Shay, right?

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:05]** I think it was Shay, talking with the Patra.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:12]** And there was a hallway to the left that you think that's probably like quarters or more admin, just kind of personal things.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:15]** And it sounded like it was coming from over there.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:21]** So it sounds like somebody was going in, walking into their room or rooms.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:25]** Question that I don't recall.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Which door we entered?

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** Did we come through this door here?

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:29]** The door?

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** So right outside of that.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** Yeah.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:34]** So there's a double door right straight out across the hall.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:37]** And there's another door to the north of that, a single pane door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** Right.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** And there was something about them.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:45]** The one that was across the hall had the electronics and everything, the sensor lock.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:46]** The other one didn't.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:51]** But that's all been hacked and destroyed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** Yeah, I think you all bypassed it.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** You bypassed the one for the double door.

**[00:37:55 - 00:38:01]** The reason you didn't go through the single door, if you recall, is because Kaniko said that door is directly across from the command center.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:06]** And so if you opened it, you're just in a more exposed area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:07]** Right.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:11]** So just for everyone, the thought in my head was, do I cross the hall?

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:16]** Or do I try to go down and around and then make up some bullshit about seeing the doctor again?

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:20]** But in that case, Rick is going to step into the hallway, taking a risk.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:21]** Okay.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** And should I roll stealth?

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** Are you trying to be stealth?

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:26]** Yes, I'm trying to be stealthy, John.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Roll stealth.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** Roll stealth.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** That is a 20.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** 11 plus 9.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:51]** and so he's gonna open the other door close the door behind him step inside and then close that door behind him as well so he's now back in the warehouse and as you step into the warehouse and you're about to shut the door you think that you hear a door open

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:51]** Where?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:55]** And then back further north of where you were.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:56]** It sounded closer.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** It sounded closer.

**[00:38:59 - 00:38:59]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** So sorry.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:04]** So as I step into the warehouse and close...

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:32]** that door i heard a door up in the area that had the the watch room in the um or command room and all that stuff yeah and actually give me just you kind of give me an initiative role right now what yeah the way you said that is just so like cavalier like yeah i am saying roll for initiative it's a 10 just because i think my initiative sucks what's my initiative

**[00:39:33 - 00:40:02]** for 14 okay 14 okay you got the higher initiative what do you do in the first round run right i'm just gonna move um so the door is closed behind me rick is going to i have to use my actual movement yeah that's why and i can't these are the so i'm in the warehouse and there's one row of uh shelves do those shelves can you see through them


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:05]** Yeah, I mean, they're kind of, they're pretty stacked.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:10]** These are the ones that I think, Dr. O'Keefe, you found those Larvalca Fox, right?

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:13]** They're like packed full of like goodies, like luxury items.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:13]** Rare goods.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Rare goods.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:17]** Chichibu malt whiskey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:21]** So Rick is going to move down.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** Okay.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** And then behind the one shelf.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:26]** Okay.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** So that's one movement.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Okay.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** And then he's going to drop prone.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** Okay.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** And do I need to roll stealth now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** My heart is racing.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** I don't like this.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** You would be using stealth to hide, right?

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** Yes.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:46]** Let me look and see if that is a... I think hiding is a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:49]** Well, dropping prone, I believe, is a swift action, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:50]** That's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** Now we're getting the rules again and I'm not prepared for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:57]** You can attempt a cell check to hide either as a move action or as part of a move action.

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:03]** So I think if you wanted to, to move down and then, and then hide by getting prone, that's totally fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:09]** But I think going prone is, is a switch action anyways, but I think prone is, but yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** So what's your hot check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:16]** Maybe it's a 20 again, 11 plus nine.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** It's a 20.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:19]** Okay.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:20]** Okay.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** Drop prone.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Drop prone is a swift action.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:22]** Yay.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:26]** So I still have... No, I'll take that back then.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:31]** I'm rolling stealth, but I'm going to crawl my way up.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** And when I'm prone, I can only move five feet, I think.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:39]** which is silly because I proved to myself that I could crawl 60 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:43]** Wait, so you did a move action and you're hiding.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** Okay.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** And you're crawling.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:48]** But I think if you're prone, you can only move five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:49]** Okay.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** So your hide roll was 20.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:51]** Okay.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** Okay.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Somebody's coming in this room.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** I can sense it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** Do you want to do anything else with your roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** No, that's it.

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** That's my whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** Okay.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** The door opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:02]** Yeah, it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:19]** I think maybe Kaniko in here, as you can see through the vision glass in the room, through the engineering door, you can see the back of a Patras head in a steward's uniform.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:51]** that door opens rick their light spills and some of it spills onto your fingers and you pull your fingers back real quick for a second as a little gap through the shelves and you wait maybe 20 seconds you hear some footsteps they step in what do you do with your next is that their whole turn

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:54]** Because we're in combat, right?

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:57]** We're in turn order.

**[00:42:57 - 00:43:00]** They moved and then they opened the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** Sorry, what is moving when prone?

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** I'm trying to look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:07]** Are you going to try and move while they're in the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** Maybe, if I can do it stealthily.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:10]** I don't know.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** I'm trying to see, man.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** Look at my options.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:13]** I don't know.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** What's moving while prone?

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:16]** I have to Google it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:19]** I can't find it in the book.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** That's a good question.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** Moving five feet uses a move action.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** Oh, that's Pathfinder.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** That's Pathfinder.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:26]** Move action.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** You can crawl five feet.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:28]** Yep.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** Okay.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:29]** Right.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:31]** Do you want to crawl five feet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** What's the other thing for hiding?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:37]** You can just stay still.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:46]** And I believe if you are not, they haven't sensed you to a degree where it's like in terms of how hiding works, right?

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:51]** You know about the fact that somebody is in the room or you're aware of location or you're aware of presence.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:55]** And so I think you get a bonus if you don't move.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** If you don't move for a stealth check, you get a bonus.

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** Right.

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** Right.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:10]** And the only reason I say that they like to the, what you know is that they've stepped in and they haven't said anything or done or done anything.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:13]** So it's really up to you what you want to do here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:18]** So it says if you're invisible or benefit from total concealment, do I have total concealment?

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** I'd say so.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** Then I get plus 40 for my stuff.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** If I remain in mobile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:23]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:26]** You're considered immobile if your turn you have not moved yet.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:33]** And if you're invisible but not immobile, you instead gain a plus 20 to your stealth.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:37]** Typically, a creature cannot attack you if you're invisible or have total concealment.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:41]** So do I have a plus 20 then to stealth checks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Why would you have plus 20?

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** You have plus 40.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:47]** Because I'm currently hiding and I'm behind total concealment.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:49]** If I move, I have plus 20.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** If I don't move, I have plus 40.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:51]** Yeah.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** But I kind of want to move closer to that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** Are the stacks high enough not to see across?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** They're shelves, right?

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Yeah, they're shelves.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:00]** Let's see.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** Are they like stacks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** Like bookshelves?

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** Or are they like half shelves?

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:16]** Yeah, there are, like, the whole space is 25 feet high, so you are, like, those shelvings pretty high.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Okay.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:25]** Yeah, so you would maybe hear the door if the door opened, but you probably wouldn't see the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** No, I think you're right.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:29]** Rick is going to just freeze in place.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Freeze.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** I'm going to take...

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** No, I think that's my whole chart.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:40]** Wait, I'm confused on the action economy of it.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:43]** Like, can I prep a movement then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** Do you want to ready an action?

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:49]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:54]** Will is miming shooting in the... Shooter!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** Shooter!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** He's whispering into the comms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** Shooter!

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:02]** Shooter!

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:13]** Rick19 what do you want to do the time is passing I'm gonna you're ready in action that if I'm seen I'm going to stand up and run


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:14]** You're going to stand up or run.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** Copy.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** Okay.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** That's your action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:24]** You're going to stand up because you only have one movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** I haven't moved at all this round.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:25]** This is a new round.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** So I have a full turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:29]** Right?

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:32]** You're saying it's a movement to stay still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:39]** If you're readying an action, you're basically mortgaging your action remaining from your current turn to use in a future round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** What do you want to do, Rick19?

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** I'm staying still.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** You're staying still.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** Okay.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** You stay still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** Because I'm assuming I was not seen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:56]** You hear a few steps like they're walking out.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** And then the door shuts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:03]** Dodged a bullet.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** The posture sure did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** And then we are out of turn order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:17]** He's going to spend 40 minutes crawling towards the other door stealthily.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:25]** And then he's going to crack open the door and run into the hangar bay where hopefully everybody else is still hanging out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** In 40 minutes?

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:28]** No, Colin's drooling on his pillow in 40 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:31]** Colin's drooling on his pillow.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:35]** So Rick is in the hangar bay now with the doors to the warehouse shut behind him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** Okay.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:40]** Can you go and, and here's, you see the pod just start to move down the hallway.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** How shook is Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:44]** Okay.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** Kevin's more shook than Rick is.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:49]** I think Rick, this isn't, this is new to Rick or isn't new to Rick.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:56]** This is, yeah, he's just like, he's relieved it happened, but he's not like nervous as nervous as Kevin is.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** Kevin's.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** Yeah, anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** Rick does this for a living, you know.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** Hey, Rick.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** How was the warehouse?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** It was a close one.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:16]** I believe the stealthy patra that I ran into the other night was... I believe that they might have seen me move into the warehouse, but they entered the warehouse and then left again.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** I think we're in the clear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:23]** And with that, he kind of moves towards... Hearing this dialogue, Colin steps back into the hangar.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:27]** It's like, oh, that patra got your tail?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** I don't have a tail.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** That was a good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** That was a good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:37]** That, uh... That was... Wow.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:42]** But he tells the two, like, I'm convinced that Kaniko and Hears will make it through the night.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:50]** Hears has one more case of... or one more spell for invisibility, and Kaniko has diplomacy on her side.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:50]** Let's hope.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** They will be okay.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:55]** It's up to us to distract the rest of the base.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:57]** Well...

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** Cue the distractions.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** And he shoots the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:09]** Super alarm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** Shots fired.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Shots fired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:16]** There is an assailant at my starboard bow.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:23]** So Dr. Okay, Colin and Rick are, yeah, you're talking, Rick is like a little shook, but good.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:26]** But you're, you're talking, what's, what's your plan right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** I mean, I think it's go back to sleep.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** Yeah.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:30]** It was Rick here.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:34]** Like Rick, Rick, it would make sense for Rick to be in his own rack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:34 - 00:50:00]** yep okay so you all start walking and going to sleep so we'll we'll put a pause on that and we'll perfectly nods serendipitous yawns yawns it was nice it was good oh i'm not tired at all i i feel you man i feel you here's and can you go we're gonna go ahead and here's you are currently i believe

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:17]** uh not invisible and you and kineka are just starting to work on the police cruisers right police vehicles that's right okay yeah okay so go ahead and put your token where you're at working on those vehicles


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:22]** I think all three of these were doing, if I remember correctly, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:26]** So the all-terrain vehicle is pretty much good to go.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:31]** I mean, you can jump in that thing and do some donuts and call it a day.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:33]** Were we going to disable one of them?

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** I forget.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:38]** So the thing was the police vehicles.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:39]** Right.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:43]** They were at a point where they let me pull up my note for the garage.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** There were three things here.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:44]** Right.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:50]** You can either do spend just a very short amount of time to disable the locks and the sensors.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** Right.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** Right.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:55]** You can spend 10 minutes per lock.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:59]** So that way you can unlock these without a key and you're a registered driver and you're good to go.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:07]** You don't have to like try and hotwire or anything, or you can spend one hour each to reset all the sensors and,

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:17]** So that way you are a driver, and so that way the sensors aren't going to ping to the command center whenever you start these up.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:22]** So there's a lock and a sensor on the steering wheel, the doors, all that stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** So they're monitored.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:29]** I think we agreed on that latter option where we're going to...

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:31]** That's what I thought too.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:40]** So here's, is going to, here's, is working on the, the car closest to him, uh, for right next to the gate to the outside.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:45]** And he's going to spend that hour, whatever to get that ready to go.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Okay.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** So he's tinkering under that car.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:49]** Like you can see, just like he has a couple of wrenches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:53]** Is it under the car or is it like you have to have the hood open?

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** That's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:54]** Yeah.

**[00:51:54 - 00:52:00]** There's like a small hood that opens kind of out and you're going to have to go to each, right?

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:09]** Like there's the main computer that you can use there, but you're going to have to go to the actual doors and the steering wheel and the ignition themselves to work on the counterpart of that.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** Okay, cool, cool.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** Well, here's doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:14]** He's kind of like touching those different parts of the car, resetting those sensors and so on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:16]** Okay, so you're working there.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** Things are quiet.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:19]** Kaniko is just trying to help you.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:23]** She knows what it's like when she is not the smartest person in the room.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:26]** She's happy to kind of hand you things, help you out.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** Can you give me that there, Kaniko?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** Perfect.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Sorry, this one?

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:35]** The one with the circle or the one with the square?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:37]** The one with the star-shaped looking thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:39]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** She kind of holds it up by the light of the...

**[00:52:42 - 00:53:04]** hallway yeah okay feels it here here you go and as she does that good job you hear and you you hear footsteps outside and i need you to give me a stealth check or high check as the door opens what a stealth or what check hide there's a high work or it's the same thing it's the same thing okay 22

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:27]** 22 let's see what keniko gets so that happens oh i just realized that too this is good she has a plus 15 to stealth she also okay yeah she also got a 22 i'm gonna use my flip die for this because the door opens and you are working at the vehicle furthest away

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** But it looks like it's being worked on.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** It's not just sitting perfectly.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:34]** It's just dead in the middle of you working on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** You didn't stealthily close it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:41]** Yeah.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** You wait for a second.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** Maybe you peek over a little bit.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** You see it's the Patra.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:50]** You see the outline of the Patra in the light of the hallway.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:54]** And then the door shuts.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** And the Patra walks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** That was close.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** Yeah, that was, yeah, that was very close.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Okay.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:06]** I think, uh, wow.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Okay.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:14]** The thing is, I think they, they come by every hour.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** Okay.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:20]** We just need to be like what, whatever we can do to like work on something and then make


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** You know, stay like it's not being worked on.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** Can you go like clockwork?

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:28]** They come by like once a solid hour or rather random.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:32]** They are a little lax, but it's usually once an hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:37]** And I have mechanics for me to include that lax nature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** So there's a bit of a threshold.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:43]** Okay, so let's give ourselves 10 minutes before and after an hour.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:46]** So let's say 15 minutes from now, okay?

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:48]** And we're going to cool it for another 30.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:48]** Roughly.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** Okay, yeah, that's cool.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** Or 20, I should say.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** Okay, all right.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:55]** So you're pretty much taking 20 on the engineering check, right?

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** Which I'm pretty sure that you can take 20 on engineering check.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** Yeah.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:54:59 - 00:54:59]** Pretty sure you can.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:02]** So what's your engineering skills?

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:08]** It's a DC 26 that you have to meet in order to make this happen.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** Or DC 26 computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** Well, I have a, Oh, okay.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:13]** I'll do computers.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:18]** Um, he, he has a plus 13 in computers.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** I rolled.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:19]** I only got a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** Yeah.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:22]** I mean, okay.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** If you take 20 on it, then you're just adding 20 cents.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** 33.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:24]** Oh, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** That's right.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:25]** That's right.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** So 33.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:26]** Yeah.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:28]** We're taking 20.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:29]** Cool.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** Okay.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:30]** Yeah.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** Okay.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** Sounds good.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:32]** Okay.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:32]** All right.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:35]** And as you're going, she's, she's like,

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** She's trying to help you out.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:41]** I'm trying to like think through everything.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:48]** And there's a, there's a moment where maybe you kind of sit, you take a break and you look over and she's kind of pensive.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** She's like, God, can you go?

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:52]** I swear to God, she stabs you in the neck.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** Can he go without looking?

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:02]** I, I just have you for it.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:06]** lost faith in someone that you looked up to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:12]** Uh, yes, I have had that experience.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** Why do you ask?

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Are you talking about a word here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:15]** Yeah.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:17]** Tell me about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:31]** It's like, well, I just look, we are friends and I feel like I've always, I don't know.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** I've always kind of looked up to him, right?

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:42]** Part of the reason why I got into what I'm doing is because I could deliver.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:47]** I could always make things happen for myself.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** My parents, they couldn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:59]** So when I saw an opportunity with Orvir, who Orvir knows how to make things happen, I was like, this is my ticket out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:06]** And then now I'm here with you and we're hijacking these vehicles.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:13]** And I'm just realizing that I don't have any faith in warfare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** And it's weird.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** Well,

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:20]** Why is this, though, Kaniko?

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:22]** What did he do specifically to make you lose faith?

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:28]** Well, I mean, he got me out of where I was, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:30]** So, like, I'm from Gascari.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** Don't know if you know about Gascari.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:33]** Yeah.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:35]** And my...

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:37]** Parents were artists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:40]** They lost their money to a con artist.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:43]** They are just artists in the truest sense and live for their art.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:45]** And they're wonderful, amazing, and make beautiful art.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** And they absolutely lost all of it.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:50]** And... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:54]** I... There's my brother involved.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:56]** It gets really complicated.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** Orvier was my first ticket out of this.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:12]** Ever since then, this has been a few years now, and ever since then, I've been serving with the Peritons, and it's been excellent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** That's exactly what I needed.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** Have I been back?

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:14]** No.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:15]** We can talk about that later.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:20]** I just wanted to know if you had ever...

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:23]** like if you knew what that was like, it's just odd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** We can get back to work.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** It's fine.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Right.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:38]** And we should get back to work, but you need to realize, can you go that no one's perfect and people make mistakes and even leaders make mistakes and, uh, you're inevitably going to let someone down sometimes.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:43]** And I'm sure one of your worries that he's letting people down sometimes and you're a leader, right?

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:46]** And you know, you're not always going to be able to pull through.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:49]** You see, you got to give people a little bit of slack.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:49]** Um,

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:51]** And part of maturing is realizing that.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** Okay.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** But we can talk about it more.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** Your feelings are very valid.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** And I've been there.

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:03]** Uh, so after we get done with this next car, let's, uh, let's talk about it some more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:04]** Okay.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** All right.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:05]** Yeah.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:05]** Okay.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:06]** Yeah.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:06]** In 40 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** By the way, Colin, Colin doesn't have any faults.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:09]** Yeah.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:10]** By the way.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:10]** Yeah.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:18]** You know, the only person who hasn't let me down yet, and it's not because he's the newest member of our group.


## Speaker_0

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:23]** Rick, however, Rick, Rick really let me down one time.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:27]** Basically my line with Rick now is like, you know, Rick, I can't wait till I die.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:31]** So you can carry my, like, uh, my corpse or what's that called?

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:34]** That thing that, you know, you get buried in, uh, yeah.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** And let me down one last time.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:39]** And he's going to be my Paul.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** Your cobs are open.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** Rick's like, what the fuck?

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:47]** Colin is basically the closest thing to flawless that I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:51]** Colin is excellent.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:51]** Don't get me wrong.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:54]** I actually really like the four of you.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:56]** You're all fantastic people.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:56]** Oh, thanks.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:59]** Oh, hey, hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** I didn't realize this was on comms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:01]** Oh, shit.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** This is on open comms.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:04]** No, this was not meant to be on comms.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:06]** Oh, this was on comms.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:06]** No, yeah.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** I don't think so.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** Snoozy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:13]** Snoring into the cobs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** Left his oven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:23]** I've actually thought that Rick is just one of the most, Rick and Colin, but some of the good hearted people that I've ever met.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:25]** I mean, they're all really great, but especially Colin.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** Anyway, let's get back to this other car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:27]** Yeah.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:28]** No, no, no.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** We should.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:29]** Yeah.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:29]** Yeah.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:29]** Sorry.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** So, so, so it's the, it's the square one.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** And she hands you the right.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:35]** No, it's the star one.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** Oh, sorry.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:36]** God.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:38 - 01:01:05]** so we we we back out of that for a second and then and then we cut to the sleeping so i i had a question because like we kind of cut when we were making our way from the hangar but i noticed as we turned the corner that there's someone sunglasses on at night really in front of the frog guy i know i didn't see my frog mask


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:07]** No, but it was one of the guys that passed in the hallway.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:09]** I saw him pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:14]** Is it a human wearing... Kind of looks like a pilot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** We haven't met this dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** Does he take notice of us at all?

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:21]** Or is it just like a thousand yards stare?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:24]** He's probably doing crosswords just like the other one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:25]** Doesn't take off the sunglasses.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:26]** Not doing crosswords.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** Hands folded.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:29]** Just like in the token.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:34]** The f***?

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:37]** No, Rick doesn't even look that way.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:44]** He just walks by as if he's coming out of the cafeteria and goes straight toward the room and steps inside.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:50]** And he's going to tell Colin and Dr. O'Kalik, I've got this room for tonight.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:55]** And he starts making up, here's his bed, as if here's his life.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:59]** And he kind of tucks the pillow in and fluffs up the copy.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** And Colin...

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:01]** What do Dr. O.K.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:02]** and Colin do?

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:04]** Do I need to roll a disguise for that?

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** For the bet?

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:05]** Sure.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:05]** Yeah.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:08]** Dr.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:11]** O.K., you walked past, but I think you would have recognized that as Brick.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:13]** That was Brick.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:17]** One of the... Here, one sec, Kev.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:21]** One of the guards that you spoke with late last night.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** I would give him a nod.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:28]** How we doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** Raise his hand.


## Speaker_0

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:29]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:32]** Seven got a, or Kev got a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:36]** As Colin and Dr. O.K.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:44]** walked past the open door, they look, and Rick had taken a Sharpie and drawn a bug face on the pillow.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:49]** Kind of squished it up.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:49]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:52]** I went down the wrong hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:57]** See, like, he's just so good at letting me down.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:59]** Look at him go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:05]** For as much experience as Rick seems to have, I keep forgetting he's still got some firsts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:08]** Totally off.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:12]** So Bernice and Dr. O'Kane and Colin head into their room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:15]** Colin's asleep before his head hits the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:18]** Sleep sounds like... It's spectacular.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:19]** Dr. O'Kane, what are you thinking?

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:21]** Drop down into your bed.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:23]** Yeah.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:26]** Dr. K, what are you thinking as you're getting ready and going to bed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:28]** Uh, I hope here's the big day tomorrow.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:31]** Uh, can't wait to bust out of this place.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:35]** Okay.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:38]** A little anxious, but yeah, a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:49]** Yeah, I feel like Colin is so threadbare and like burnt out in so many ways from the last three days that just like a decent bed and he's gone.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:51]** Yeah, makes sense.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** Anyway, sorry.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:54]** Nothing to apologize for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:54 - 01:04:01]** That room, it's a little bit of anxiety, but tiredness overtakes both of you at some point.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:06]** Resolves, just pulls you into the nice, gentle slumber.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** Are you saying sleeping is a constant resolve point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:11]** No, but you did both leave your doors open.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:12]** So I'm going to close them.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:13]** Cause assuming you didn't leave jokes.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:17]** Anyway, Rick 19, what are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:19]** In case there's any cats that want to.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** Oh yeah.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** Small scratch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:27]** Rick, what are you thinking as you're trying to fall asleep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:36]** Uh, yeah, Rick, Rick is laying in the rack and he's, he's just, he's really distraught.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:42]** Like he wanted to have full faith in the stewards of what they are and who they are.

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:50]** And that this base was that, and that, that everything with the grays was behind them and that problems were solved and he can go about his business.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:52]** And that's not happening.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:55]** He's not allowed to go out and murder things.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:55]** Yeah.

**[01:04:55 - 01:05:02]** Yeah, so he's, like, hugging his artillery laser and just thinking, like, I don't know where this is going.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:05]** I don't know what's going to happen next.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:13]** And the only people that I can trust are my guns and the three people that I ran into on the chimera.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:23]** Not just two people on the chimera, one person in a rosebush on an alien...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:49]** you know outpost so he's he's he's distraught over all that and but like as he caresses his artillery laser does the artillery laser have a name not yet no damn it didn't we give it oh wait didn't we like wasn't there a scene where here is like blessed it or something but we didn't give it valiantly yes yeah yes i see okay so you're


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:50 - 01:06:06]** waves of emotions that feeling he's an android no emotions waves of thoughts just general thoughts as you're lying down which is what happens as you're about to fall asleep your brain gets you start to focus on one thing

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:07]** Exactly.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:10]** Exactly.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:11]** Thank you.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:13]** I couldn't have said it better myself.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:14]** God.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:15]** God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:19]** Oh.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:19]** Oh.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:20]** All right.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:21]** We're going to bleep that.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:22]** We're bleeping that.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:25]** At the end of the episode, we're bleeping that.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:25]** That is wild.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:27]** That is crazy.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:28]** That is too much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:31]** That is crazy work right there.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:36]** Whether that happens in your sleep or not, TBD.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** We'll leave that to imagination.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** That's beyond the scope of this adventure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:41]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:46]** Kelly's like, please, please continue.

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:47]** I'm enjoying it.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** It's good.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:48]** Good.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:54]** So yeah, that, that feeling of, of lying down and your brain wants to go in one direction.

**[01:06:54 - 01:07:09]** And then as your brain starts thinking about how you're distraught about the stewards, about who you trust, then little, you know, as you fall asleep, your brain starts making connections for you, starts making decisions for what you're thinking about.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:13]** And you kind of lose yourself in the slipstream as your consciousness falls asleep.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:25]** And then at one point, Rick, there's like a whiteout that comes back into the back of your eyes.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:32]** And you're moving backwards and you're in this huge tunnel.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:40]** And there's a sense that there's like frenetic energy all around you.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:40]** Things are erratic.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:44]** You're in the middle of a combat.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:49]** There are faces that you can't recognize, but you're still moving back and

**[01:07:49 - 01:08:16]** lasers are moving back into your gun you're recognizing vaguely this magma heat filled area you feel yourself starting to move faster backwards up steps up through and through a library backwards up more steps up into a little private office and then more steps faster and faster through offices back into a chopper back into a museum back in through at your home and

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:20]** but you don't know why it's your home.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:25]** Sleeping Rick19, give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:27]** Is his world on fire?

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:28]** How about yours?

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:29]** How about yours?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:36]** Natural 20 for 27.

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:37]** Natural 20.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:38]** Natural 20.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:45]** You're moving backwards so quickly watching a life that you feel like you know and you don't know at the same time.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** So much so that

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:52]** Your brain is just letting it all happen.

**[01:08:54 - 01:09:01]** But you know that feeling when you're watching something and there's someone else in the room watching it with you?

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:05]** That's the feeling that you have.

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:09]** That you're not the only one watching what you're watching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:12]** And that's our game.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:13]** It's Cecil, right?

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:15]** Is that like Cecil's life?

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:18]** Wait, that was your...

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:21]** So that was the nano-venture is what he was describing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:22]** Yeah, exactly.

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:24]** The ice we skate.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:32]** I was going to say, he missed the part where you rewind through the office and it's connected to the living space that he never actually got to.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:37]** Didn't talk about that much, but I don't understand someone else in the room part, though.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:40]** See you next week.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:42]** See you next week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:43]** Love y'all.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:45]** Bye.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:45]** Bye.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:46]** Bye.
