## Speaker_0

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:22]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:25]** Welcome to We'll Save the Puckettes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:27]** We'll Save the Puckettes!

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** We'll Save the Puckettes!

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:30]** We'll Save the Puckettes!

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:34]** We'll Save the Puckettes!

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:36]** We'll Save the Puckettes!

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:41]** We'll Save the Puckettes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:43]** We could see victims of reptilian body snatchers, too.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** We don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** John is admitting that he's a reptilian.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** The question is, how long has he been a reptilian?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** Reptoid?

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:51]** Reptilian?

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** Reptoid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:54]** It's a reptoid in Starfinder, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:57]** Reptilians are real life lizard people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Are they real life?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Does Ariel know?

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:01]** That's the question.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:02]** Does she know?

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** It's probably those cats, man.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** The cats?

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** No, the cats are good.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** The cats are where you want.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** The cats can help determine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:13]** Yeah, every cat that I know always attack lizards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:19]** Speaking of lizards, my mom sent this video on Facebook.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:21]** I mean, this thing is massive.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** It's like the size of your fist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Mark Zuckerberg?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:29]** No, it's a real lizard that's probably at least six inches long that's living under her refrigerator.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:32]** Her dog brought it into the house.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** And now it lives there.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:34]** That's true.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:37]** And at first I was like, oh my God, you have this giant lizard in your kitchen.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:39]** And then she's like, yeah, this came in on Sunday.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** And I was like, it's Wednesday.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:40]** Wow.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** Did she name it?

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:46]** I don't know.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:49]** I think she's still trying to convince it to leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:49]** Yeah.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** Are they contributing to the household?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** If it eats bugs, it's probably a good thing.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:56]** I've heard people will put geckos in their house to eat all the bugs.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** They'll have feeds of geckos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** I've got a utility room that lizards can live in all they want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:03]** I'd f*** with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:09]** I'd rather have a lizard tag around than a mozzie or some other foul creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** I did have... What's a mozzie?

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** What is that?

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** A mosquito.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:14]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** F*** mosquitoes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:18]** I've never heard that before, but I agree with you on that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:23]** I've become very friendly with spiders since moving to Maryland.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:25]** I'm like, oh, look, another spider.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** Cool, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:26]** I still hate them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:35]** So I was in Chicago for work and I came back and there was a giant banana spider on the light, like built a big strandy way.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** It's still there.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** Like this is a month.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** I now have a pet spider, I guess.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:46]** I leave, I leave the light on so that the bugs come to the web and I guess it's a symbiotic relationship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** It's great.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:53]** I don't know what you're getting other than have it destroy the hyperlocal ecosystem of your front porch.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:53]** Right?

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** It keeps the bugs from coming in my front door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:02]** There's a spider that lives above the treadmill in the security camera.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:12]** The thing is, I think the original one died, and now its kids are running the show, and one of them is huge.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]** And I don't know if it's nice or not.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:21]** But the problem is that I think some of them got outside because now there's, like, this little walkway full of hedges that, like, are on either side of the gym entrance.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** So it's kind of like a wildwood that you have to walk through.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** And every f***ing night, I'm going to go work out.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:32]** And then, like, I have to, like, shine my light and look for these giant spiders that have made webs across the entire f***ing hedges.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** And I don't walk into it.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** Just walk with a walking stick.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** Just get the f*** out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:38]** Yeah.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:38]** Yeah.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:45]** That's what I have to do when I go hiking in the mornings because no one else is as tall as me walking that trail.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:48]** So I've got to carry a big stick and swat the Florida spiders.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:51]** Otherwise, they're going to be my new hair treatment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:56]** I was trimming trees the other day and I had a branch fall pretty close to me.

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:01]** And my wife alerted me like, oh, you have a giant spider in your hair.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:01]** Oh.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:03]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** You do the crazy dance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:09]** I didn't do the crazy dance.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:15]** In the most manly fashion, I just brushed him off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** Get out of here.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:20]** In the madliest of ways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:29]** I read a story, I don't know if it was on Reddit or where, but it showed pictures of this family, definitely an Australian family, that had this giant spike.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:34]** It was the size of both my hands, and there was pictures of it in all these different rooms.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:40]** And I guess it was this husband and wife that were like, it lives in our house now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:55]** yikes nah not gonna happen for me yeah knock no no no that's a no i will apologize to it and say kind sir please kindly remove yourself yeah yeah you are not paying rent and you need to leave


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:20]** big as your hand is scary because like that thing could conceivably possibly like take me out you know i'm saying like in my sleep that's true like if you're sleeping they'll just i feel like though face hugger style their fangs are too big no or is that just like a urban mess i feel like the big spiders can't hurt you i'm gonna go like a tarantula yeah big spiders hurt you yeah but they they can't kill you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:23]** The larger ones tend to have less venom, I think.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** Is that what it is?

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:29]** They're more like just kill through brute force kind of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:34]** Less venom by volume or just less venom overall?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:34]** Yeah, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** I don't know.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** Or the venom isn't toxic to humans?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:39]** Yeah.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:44]** We're very lucky in that the larger spiders tend to be the less killy for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:48]** Because I know it's like the small scorpions that you've got to worry about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:52]** If the big ones were the dangerous ones, you could see them easier.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:54]** Yeah, that's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** That's very true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:58]** Have you seen...

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:04]** I swear to you, there's some YouTube of somebody who lets spiders and snakes bite him.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** And then he documents it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:10]** He's probably in Florida.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** Probably in Florida.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** Probably wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** Because dilution is a solution.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:21]** If you can absorb enough of it over time, then you become invincible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:42]** that's it see he just wants to be like the ultimate like f***ing enemy of spiders so he develops all these like yeah that'd be cool he gets bit by every spider at the same time and then he just comes in and just f***ing annihilates them all and then he just punches them yeah just takes them out has anybody seen Madam Web?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:47]** no I haven't it's terrible it's not worth watching I don't want to waste my time with that Madam Web?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:48]** yeah

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** Is it a Marvel movie?

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:50]** Because no thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:51]** No.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** They all suck now.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** But it is Spider-Man.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:57]** Is it Fox or Sony?

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:57]** So it's a Sony film.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:02]** It's a Sony film using Madam Web from Spider-Man.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:05]** But in the Spider-Man comics, she's this old woman.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** And she's in the cartoons too.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:12]** She's the old woman in the chair that wears the dark red spider suit.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** And she can see the future.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:19]** And in this movie, she's like a 25-year-old EMT.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:23]** And she can also kind of see the future, but only if she's about to die.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:26]** And so it's like an action movie, kind of.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:29]** And the bad guy is like an alternative Spider-Man.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:29]** That's so Raven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** Because she can only do it sometimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:37]** That's so Raven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** I don't know.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** Natalie, my sister watched that show growing up.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** And I was like, ah, fuck it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:44]** Thank you for tying Matt Webb to That's So Raven.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:45]** That's great.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** It sounds like it's just as bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:55]** If you've been flying, you know, three weeks in a row and ran out of movies to watch on the plane, then you would do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** I'll watch something else.

**[00:08:56 - 00:09:03]** The question is, could the four of you have seen the future and seen what was to come?

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** Hacking into that future.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:10]** Yeah, Rolume, if God bless his soul, we're fucking still around.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:10]** I don't know.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:13]** I do miss Rollo.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:13]** Don't worry.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:14]** Don't worry.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:15]** Yeah, don't worry.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** Yeah, he'll be back.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:17]** Don't worry.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** In some form or another.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:20]** Because that Rollo was a reptoid.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:25]** If Rollo's being controlled by the Christ, I'm going to be very impressed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:27]** Wait, if Rollo's what?

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:55]** if we lose the big bad i'll be super impressed you know okay well we'll see we'll see sensational let's play let's play let's get back to it a couple things before we play a couple housekeeping things going on first things first in foundry you might notice that on your left or sorry on your right in the dock at the bottom there's a new way to roll uh i believe there is the like i

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:15]** icons of dice there and you can add as many as you want and it will add in the code and you can hit keep highest keep lowest and hit roll so i'm expecting that that there's going to be a bunch of rolls here in just a second there it is that's what i'm doing right now 142 john 1d 12 plus 1d 20 plus 1d 100 plus 1d 10 plus 28 plus 26 plus 24 you pass yeah could we always do that

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Possibly.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:17]** I don't know.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:22]** I added in a new module just to help out with some of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:25]** It basically types out the command for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:26]** What the fuck?

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** I didn't intend for that.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** Oh, dick, Rick.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** Stop showing off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** 7563.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:32]** All right.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** That's it.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** I'm going to do this now.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** Try to beat the shit right there.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:37]** All the way down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** Oh, no.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Electrode dice can roll.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** Yeah.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** It's not that much, actually, for what I tried to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:47]** And another Foundry thing, I am using a new module.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** Guess the number, win a prize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:56]** I'm using a new module, and this is sort of a plea for help from some people.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:59]** It's a module I just found out about yesterday called GMScreen.

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** And it's great.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** It provides you a little pop-up window that you can use.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:06]** You can drag and drop journal entries and PDFs and images and videos.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:10]** And so I can very quickly have at a tap all these tabs with all this information.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:11]** Great.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:11]** Awesome.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:20]** I can even set up a player one so you all could click it and see sort of a cheat sheet of like, oh, yeah, what's so-and-so's name?

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** Who are they related to?

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** What's this journal entry?

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:25]** Kind of like a quick grab of things, right?

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:26]** Yeah.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** That's cool.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:30]** The problem is that it was not updated after Foundry version 10.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** And we're on Foundry version 12.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** And it's still working for now.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:34]** For now.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:47]** But the dev has said that they can't really update it because whatever changes happen with journals, it would require essentially just a whole rework of the entire module and not just updates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** Dependency hell.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:49]** Yeah.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** Which I get.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:51]** It's a lot of work.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** It's a lot of work.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:59]** So if you feel like doing that out there, I'm trying it out this session and the next few sessions to see if it's worth it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:02]** Whoever that dev is, could you just make it open?

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:07]** Could you allow people to do PRs on it so that we can get something?

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** I think you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:10]** There's a whole GitHub for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:10]** Is it open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Okay, well then, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:13]** Because Kelly's looking for work.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:36]** because he's trying to get something i'm not looking for work but i don't i don't want uh i don't want to do prs for that though it's fair it's fair cool last thing we it's a node i think node and oh okay probably react wait foundry's made a node and react it's runs on no uh

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:43]** Last thing, we are looking at a 5.15 time here in-game.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:53]** So just thought it would be good to kind of start each game where we have this timer in here so we know at what time the game is starting, how long things pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:56]** Pray tell, John, what role does time play in this adventure?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:56]** Who knows?

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** Who knows?

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** Does anyone really know what time it is?

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** Recap!

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** Quick recap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Does anybody really care?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** I think it will become important later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:13]** You made quick work in your explorations of the restricted area.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:16]** You made a beeline for the command center.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:21]** Colin began exploring through Jock's herd's room while Rick-19 stood guard.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** And Dr. O'Kane hears.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:26]** Find a number of interesting updates.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:29]** as you all are hacking through the computer.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** Let's go through those real quick.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:48]** You find that although the stewards have been monitoring your quarters, they've decided to not re-engage or update anything with the surveillance and instead have just noted the times from their previous surveillance when you were entering, when you were talking, what you were saying.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:51]** Decided to let that go.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:53]** You find a communications module.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:56]** I don't know if we let that go.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** No, they did.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:58]** Oh.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** They did.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:26]** You find a communications module that you're unable to get through the firewall, but through a connection into Inspector Hurd's computer behind you, you see that all comms are being sent through Terrapin Station to go off-planet, and that there's a tight cover over the planet-wide comms unit that is in Tercalus, and it's piped directly to Terrapin to go off-planet.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:32]** Maybe more importantly, though, you find evidence of a disturbing fact.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:41]** Logs, personnel files that state that nearly all the stewards are reptoids.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:53]** The conspiracy creature species that is known to infiltrate governments, seek power, classically evil organizations.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:57]** In that roster includes Orvier Pike, the leader of the Peritons.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:01]** Silverton, Dr. Nodin's assistant, is not.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:12]** You also determined that Inspector Hurd has been in communication with, let's say, Reptoid Masters at the Steward's Base on Roselight.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:16]** Maybe you're trying to think about where is this coming from?

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:22]** And I'm talking about you as players and you as characters.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:26]** And we'll get into how much time you had to think about that in a minute.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:34]** But if we just walk down that path real quick, you think back to moments that maybe stuck out, that led you to suspicion.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:41]** If you recall in The Void Crier, when you first joined, Gnarly Yalamis seemed to be a little clumsy, get lost.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** She was a little unlucky.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** She had a Weyden tattoo on her.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:48]** Was she cursed by Weyden?

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** Maybe just...

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:52]** Maybe just unlucky.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:52]** Just kind of clumsy.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:59]** Orvier was dodgy during your conversation, Colin, when you went to talk on your first day yesterday, right?

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** And also, he's never around.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** He's one of the only ones who can go in the back.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** He's not spending time with his team.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:10]** Maybe he's just busy trying to figure out things with the stewards, or maybe there's something more going on.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:14]** Why was Dr. Nodin so aggressive in her questioning?

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:34]** especially to to you dr okay really to everybody right did she did she relish in that manipulation and that pain also she she called the grays like filthy and in general there's been a very the the antagonism towards the grays from them

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** Here's your conversation with Shay.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:44]** Why was he so knowledgeable about gemstones and so eager for you to add your puck into the machine?

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:49]** Why did Officer Astara almost turn when she might have heard something?

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** Is she deaf?

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Coincidence?

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** What language were they all talking in?

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:55]** Why did Dr. Nodens want your blood?

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:58]** Why did they all eat that larval kefak dish?

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:03]** Keep in mind, these are truly just questions because your characters have not seen anything yet.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:08]** You haven't seen any physical reptoid in front of you.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** You just read these files.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:12]** None of them have presented to you as a reptoid.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:14]** It's only Inspector Heard's log files.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:20]** So everything you just said was actual indications that they're Reptoids?

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:23]** Or are you feeding us more shit to make us second guess ourselves?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:32]** I think he's trying to justify himself and the suspicious activity that he dropped hints of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:53]** it doesn't change what we're gonna do we're gonna get the fuck out of here well this is Kevin speaking but like the the Reptoids take over the super secret base and then they happen to keep a log of all the people they've replaced on the computer system of the base I mean yeah why not

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** I don't know.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:56]** Have you ever played Fallout somewhere else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:58]** Kev, is that a reptile?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:05]** No, this is actually just a dinosaur.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:09]** Are you sure it's not the soul of Kevin that's been replaced by your soul that's in Kevin's body?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:14]** I'll let you guys think what you want to think.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** I'm just pointing things out.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** Also, I want to say one thing.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:21]** Don't forget that you as PCs may have looked up Reptoids.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:33]** You may know other things, but despite the fact that you do, obviously for the purposes of information checks and role play and stuff, your characters might not know necessarily as much.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:37]** That's for you to decide.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:43]** And then as you're going to GTFO, because keep in mind, you just read this on the computer mere minutes ago.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:49]** And you don't know anything else about why they might have done what they've done or who they really are.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:53]** Rick 19, you're standing in front of the training room and you hear a scream.

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:05]** And then as Dr. OK and Hears open the hangar doors and tell Kaniko that they are open.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:11]** And right before Rick 19 hits the signal jammer, you get a comms message from Kaniko aboard the bridge.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:35]** of the periton she has seen orvier and dr nodens aboard the void crier she is frantic she is freaking out she is desperately trying to raise the periton shields before she then sees the void criers weapons aimed at her and then the comms goes dead as you hear this massive boom reverberate around the chamber pretty intense pretty intense

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** And that's where we'll pick up.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:39]** Let's come back into Tirkala's base here.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:50]** As we are now standing, the four of you, Rick19, Colin, Dr. OK, and Bernice are standing in the center right outside the command center.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:53]** Here's is right inside the command center.

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:12]** You can feel briefly sort of like aftermath, maybe a couple shocks, like a light falls down in the corridor as you realize that this boom, while you may know what it is, you are unsure of its impacts on the base as a whole.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:18]** Rick19, I'm going to open the door in front of you to the training center, and you see Shay Dysha in front of you.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:27]** There's a surprise look on Shay's face, and he says, What the hell was that boom, and what the hell are you doing here, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:33]** It sounded like it came from the hangar bay, and that's... I could be asking you the same thing.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** Keep your hands dry.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** I see them.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** What the hell are you talking about?

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:40]** And he's got his artillery laser pointed right at him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:44]** Rick, you need to put that thing down and we need to figure out what the hell is going on.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:50]** Because if this is an attack, then we need to be praised and prepared to fight back against whatever has just happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** This guy's a reptoid, right?

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:52]** Yep.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:54]** That's what the records say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:59]** Where's Silverton?

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** Do we know where Silverton is?

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** We don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** You don't.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:07]** Look, I'm going to step out, Rick, because we need to see what's going on here.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:07]** Don't move.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** Stay where you are.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:11]** What the f***, Colin?

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:15]** And then you hear from behind them, you hear Narlow's voice.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** What's going on out there?

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** And then she kind of steps up.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** Rick, you can see behind Shay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:24]** Rick, I'm going to take a step forward.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** He's waving at the other guys to go.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** Rick...

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** I'm going to take a step forward.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** I don't know what's gotten into you.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:34]** If you take a step out of that door, I will open fire.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** Stand down.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** Keep your hands where I can see them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** All right, well, I'm going to go this way.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** You guys have fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:41]** We're just going to head back to the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:44]** Yeah, we're going back to the party.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:48]** Dr. K and Kears are starting to walk down the hallway.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** That's all that you say, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:53]** I mean, you paused the game.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** Do you want me to do an intimidation check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:58]** What is your plan here?

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** What are you trying to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** I also want to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:04]** I'm trying to hold the line so you f***ers could get through to the garage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:07]** You could have just let them go to the hangar.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:09]** Alright, it's f***ing Rick always resorting to violence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Hey, Kev, you remember what happened last time we did this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** Wait, no, what?

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:15]** What happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:16]** Mothership.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:19]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:19]** Okay.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Not the same.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:23]** Definitely not the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** Go ahead, Rand.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:27]** When you're done playing, come meet us, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** At the party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:31]** At the party, because I have some champagne.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:31]** Apparently it's rocking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** I want to tell you about something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:33]** The entire base.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** It's explosively fun.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:35]** Four.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:37]** Initiative.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** Oh, f*** me.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:41]** Oh, come on.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:44]** I mean, we haven't battled in like three months.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** I guess that's a good thing, but like... Yeah, how does combat work again?

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** Yeah, that's a great question.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:50]** That's a really, really good question.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** Oh, here we go.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** Oh, god.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:55]** I don't like being high on initiative, actually.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:57]** Usually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:00]** Dr. Okay rolled a 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:09]** Okay, make sure you click on your character, right-click, and then click on the crossed swords and shield.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:13]** You can add yourself in, and you can roll for initiative.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** Oh, do it this way.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** All right, cool.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:15]** Yeah.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** Sweet.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** Four, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** What's the yellow bar under my character?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:23]** That would appear to be your health.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** I think you might need to update your health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:27]** I don't track my health on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:30]** That was probably just me tracking your health then, so don't worry about it.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:30]** I can just check.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** Can just change it here.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:35]** Okay, we're in a bit of a standoff here.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:43]** We have Shay and Narla and the four of you getting ready to possibly see what's happening here.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:47]** I'm going to go ahead and roll for Shay and for Narla.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:50]** Okay, that is going to be this.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:53]** Okay, Dr. Okay, what did you get?

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** 13.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** For your initiative.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** 13.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:58]** Okay, what's your initiative modifier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** No, 13 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:00]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** What's your... Two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:03]** Two.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:03]** Okay.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** Cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:07]** They're all wearing party gear, right?

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** Nobody's wearing armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:09]** Nice try.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:15]** Nice try.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** Colin, what did you get?

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:16]** 13.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** What's your... Plus four.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:20]** Plus four.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** Okay.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:25]** And... Rick, what did you get?

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:41]** I mean, it's all good.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** You can't read foundry.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:44]** I want to roll.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:44]** Yeah.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:45]** Okay.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** It's probably quite high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:41]** I know we have into combat in a minute, but... I'm just waiting for Hero Lab to scroll.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:41]** Uh-huh.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:42]** Uh-huh.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:42]** Uh-huh.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** My dex is a plus four.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** Dex is a plus four.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:46]** Cool.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** Okay.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** That is what I thought.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:48]** Cool.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:52]** You are all entered in at the moment.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** Let's see what happens here.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** Fabricius, you are up first.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** What are you doing with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** Rick and Colin are holding the line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:05]** Here's is going to shout to Shay.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:05]** He's like, Shay.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:10]** Well, actually, he's going to roll, I guess, a diplomacy check.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:36]** okay or maybe it needs to be a bluff because what he's suggesting is he wants to basically be like why don't we like do a pincer move on like the hangar you guys go up that way we're gonna wrap around to down south and like try to like you know meet whatever threats in like the hangar so he wants to say that is that bluff or diplomacy i guess bluff right that is a bluff if you're trying to make that happen yeah i'm not very good at those which would go against uh yeah

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** Yeah, well, it's only an eight, John.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** It's only an eight.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:43]** I don't have high skills in this area because I'm not a liar.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** Okay.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:47]** All right.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** That's what you say.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:53]** Shay, Rick is like, he's just startled because all of that noise.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:59]** Why don't we just calm down and relax and you go to the hangar, we'll go to the hangar, and we'll try to check out what's going on.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:01]** I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** With my eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:07]** So you don't do anything and you say that.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** What is the rest of your action?

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** What's your standard action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:19]** Well, he's going to ready... Well, if you're trying to do a... If you're trying to suede him, then that is your standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:22]** I'm trying to look at Blum right now to make sure that that is true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:28]** If you're actually trying to manipulate someone else using a skill, then that is an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:53]** telling a lie is at least a full action yep all right fine so that's your full action okay yeah that's right i want to calm this there's no reason to do this hopefully okay cool round one here's is like we we have started to start the car we have started to move into initiative order yeah but those motherfuckers are gonna be chasing us the entire way and we have to get us out it's gonna suck so okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** We're going to move into Rick's turn.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** What are you doing?

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:02]** Kears has shouted this from behind you at Shay and Narla, who are standing at the open door to the train.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:07]** He's going to run in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:09]** I really just want to step forward and close the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** Okay.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** You guys stay here.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** I'll check it out.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:20]** They'll just open the door behind us, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** Maybe we can just leave, Rick.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** What do you want to do, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:26]** What's it gonna be?

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** Shay, stand down.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:29]** Stay where you are.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** We're leaving.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:34]** Oh my god, why are you telling them everything?

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** Because they're f***ing reptoids.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** Don't tell them what we're doing.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:38]** You know they know.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** They know we know.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** They don't know that.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** We don't know that they know.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:42]** You don't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** Rick19 says, we are leaving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:47]** And then what happens?

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:50]** I don't want to take a ready to action because they fucking suck.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:59]** But I'm going to ready an action to open fire if Shay attacks and or passes through the door.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Oh my God, so much for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:08]** Yeah, I'm just going to say, tactically speaking, we are probably in the worst place right now.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** You are into a hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:13]** Thaddeus would not approve of this situation.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** I can tell you that much.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:15]** Of running away?

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:22]** Rule number three of Thaddeus' art of tactics is don't do this kind of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** I mean, we have them pinned in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** Do we?

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:30]** You think that they can't communicate with their pals and they can't make their way over here?

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:32]** We're about to be sworn, potentially, by 15 fucking people.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** You've just been waiting.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** You've just been waiting to kill something.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:36]** That's it.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** That's all this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** I see the edge of Silverton in there.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:41]** Rick activated the jammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:41 - 00:30:04]** rick rick did let's take one thing at a time and when you get to your turn we can ask about it so in the meantime you're uh but good eye uh let's let's look at what a signal jammer does in starfinder up to 400 meters or something signal jammer uh

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:10]** It blocks all communication devices from sending and receiving broadcasts.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:15]** Each signal jammer is designed to affect one specific broadcasting medium, radio or wireless.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:21]** You can attempt a computer or engineering check to bypass the said signal jammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:24]** They know that it's being jammed, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:27]** Okay, so Rick19, what are you doing?

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:30]** You were taking a step back and saying, we are leaving.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** Don't come out.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** Don't try and stop us.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** Don't stop me now.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** You're having such a good time.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:39]** I'm having such a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:47]** And I have a readied action to open fire if he attacks or if he comes out of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** If he attacks or comes out of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:50]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** Okay.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:57]** I'm stating it that way in case he pulls a gun and shoots us because then you were going to be like, well, he didn't come out of the room.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** So I'm trying to make it very clear.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:02]** If he pulls a gun and does something hostile, he's getting shot.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:07]** If he steps past the boundary to come out the door after I told him not to, he's going to get shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Okay.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** So you're pointing your gun at the ground.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** Going to try and make that happen.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:12]** Okay.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** I'm going to point my gun where?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** You have your gun ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** I have my gun pointed at him.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** High ready.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:18]** Chest.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:19]** High ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:20]** Thank you, Will.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** Appreciate it.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** Appreciate it.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:22]** Low ready.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:23]** High ready.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** It is Shay Dash's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:27]** Yeah, what's he going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:30]** What is he going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:36]** He's going to choose violence is what he's probably going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** Colin and Rick19.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:45]** You hear Shay say, Melt the man.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** I need your help.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** Where's Melt the man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:51]** But the transmission can't go through.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Hopefully not yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:53]** If it's in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:55]** I was going to say, it depends on where Melt the man is.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:56]** Let it play out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** Also, yeah, it's cool.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:05]** Also, my understanding based on him being a mechanic and his connection.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** That's his drone?

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:11]** I didn't know this that whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:23]** He is going to take out, you see him, Rick, go to pull a weapon and point it at the ground, and he's going to take a step forward and say, Rick 19, I can't let you leave.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Of course.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** Do you fire?

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** He stepped past the door?

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:28]** Yes.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** He pulled out a gun, takes a five-step foot forward.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:34]** This action occurs before his action, right?

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:37]** So he technically doesn't move out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** That I forget.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:41]** I think if it's a defensive action, it goes before.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:42]** Oh, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** If it's offensive.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:44]** Okay, cool.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:49]** So he just takes a five-foot step forward, gun ready.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** and says, Rick19, I can't let you leave.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** And then you fire a shot at him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** I warned you.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:54]** Yep.

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:01]** And that's a 17 on the die and a plus 9 for a 26 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:07]** For a 26 to hit against Shay Daisha, Steward.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** That's a hit.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:09]** He's not a steward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** He's a reptile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:11]** He's a fucking reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** You haven't seen anything yet.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:18]** Unless that was just like a honeypot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:23]** That's 15 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** 15 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** Fire type, if that means anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:38]** Okay, 15 points of damage as this shot shoots across the very small space, like 15 feet.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:44]** And that fire, I mean, it just, like, scorches the front of his entire chest.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:47]** And you can see him just take the hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** So, question, though.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:51]** I'm supposed to move in initiative order.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:55]** But do I move in initiative order since I acted before he did anyways?


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:56]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:59]** That's the thing, is that I think you're already before him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:05]** I think you would move after him because he took his move action and then you reacted to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:07]** So because it was offensive and not purely defensive.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:13]** Yeah, that's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** It's open to interpretation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** But it's going to be for next turn, not for this round.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:21]** And it's up to you if you want to actually just shift us in the order.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:21]** Right.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** So anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** Shay takes a shot to the face.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** And then what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** Shay takes a shot to the face.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:39]** And then he is going to side step out, which would give you an opportunity attack if you would like to take it, Colin Eden Brand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** Is it a guarded step out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** I do have.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:45]** No, because he already took a normal five foot step.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** Yeah, I'm going to stab this motherfucker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** Yeah, he's got a survival.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:52]** So this is where are you?

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** This is still a part of his movement action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:57]** Yeah, I'm just in front of the control room.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:58]** He's here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:03]** So he's outside the control room and he was diagonal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:07]** Will stab him with a trained flick of the wrist.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:12]** Colin right between the ribs.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:14]** That's a 19 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:18]** That's a 19 to hit against KAC.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:20]** Against KAC.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:22]** That is a hit against Shea Dysha.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:23]** Got him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** How many points of damage you do?

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:25]** Let's see.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** Let me roll a caltrop and I'll tell you.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:28]** Tell me.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:33]** That is two points of... S is for stab damage, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** S is for... Slashing.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** Slashing, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** It's definitely stab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:38 - 00:36:03]** okay yep for sure for sure two points of stab damage okay just slicing in between the little nick of the armor just add a little cut on his arm yep okay he steps over into the corner no i'm sorry negate that i can't do that what why oh because it's because you haven't acted i have not acted in this in this uh conflict

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** Thank you.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** Nailed it.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** Thanks for those two points back.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:14]** Shay Daisha raises his gun at Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** Of course it is.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** I have shit armor.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:21]** And he says, Oh, I could have gotten armor before I left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:24]** He says, in your mind, Rick, only you hear this.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:30]** He says, I should have let you die on Outpost Omicron.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** Fucking Shay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:39]** That is going to be an 18 against EAC.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:42]** That's a miss.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** 18.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** Wow, Rick19.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** Baller.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** What was that for?

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:51]** Excitement.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** Oh, okay, cool.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** All right, this is good.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** Yeah, I was like, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:58]** That was him straining to pick up his big swinging nuts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:04]** The shot fires and hits the corner that's right in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:06]** This is more of a meta question.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:08]** Are Reptoids telepathic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** Yeah, they have psychic abilities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** Well, I'm going to say this once again.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** I'm going to say this once again.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** You as players know this.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:17]** I don't know that your characters know this.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:23]** So if you would like to do a life science or mysticism check in order to figure these things out, I would advise you to do that so you're not metagaming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:28]** I mean, I probably would have done it upon discovering the info.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** Sure.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:35]** I would still encourage you to maybe do it in combat if you would like to know specifically if there's anything there.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** Because maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:57]** so colin colin what do you want to do uh i want to know if these creatures have a cr3 or greater than a cr3 wait what how would i find out what cr these characters i don't think you typically can find out the cr okay cool just just just like i can't tell you like the hp or the


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:01]** Then I'm going to step over and I'm going to cast daze on Shay.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** Going to cast daze on Shay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:05]** Okay.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:13]** That is a... I need to roll... The mind of a humanoid creature with a CR of three or lower so that it is dazed.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:17]** Humanoids four or higher after a creature has been dazed.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** Will save negates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** DC 14 will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Okay.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:29]** I will just tell you that you go to cast your days, and he just looks at you and smiles.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:30]** It does not work.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:31]** Cool.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** Well, uh...

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:59]** colin's gonna keep it moving okay he does not have a melee weapon out because you did step into a square next to him and then step away i did but he did not take an ao in front of you and now it is uh shay's turn or sorry it's not shay's turn uh it's it's colin rick here's and dr okay in a straight line down the hallway here with shay standing right outside the door to the training center is still open and it's dr okay's turn what are you doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:00]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:04]** is going to open the door to the hangar where the cars are at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:06]** Open the door to the hangar.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** Love it.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:13]** I'm assuming the hangar doors are also open because we turned them open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:14]** Yes.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:17]** So the hangar doors are also open.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:19]** It's pretty warm in there, I'm sure.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** Both hangar doors are open.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** It's getting a little hot.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:27]** As soon as you open that door, you can feel that the air is rushing in front of your face.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:35]** You're probably going to need to turn on your environmental protections at some point if you want to stay in here for a while because it is extremely hot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:37]** Does the car have AC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:38]** No.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:41]** I'm talking about if you're just going to stand and bang in the hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:42]** Stand and do what?

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** Stand and bang in the hangar.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:47]** Stand and bang in the hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** I mean, I can move to one of the cars.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:54]** Is that what you want to do?

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:54]** Yeah, I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** It's five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:03]** Dr. Okay makes a beeline for the cars.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** Smart.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** Bernice is going to follow.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** Bernice is going to follow.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Okay.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:10]** That sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** Move to one extra.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** Uh-oh.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:14]** John's moving stuff in the warehouse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:14]** Rude.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** There's no need in metagame for that reason.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:20]** I'm going to turn off ping ability.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:24]** You all are metagaming left and right today.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** I'm just making observations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Is there a window at that door?

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** At what door?

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** The door next to the warehouse.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** There were two doors into the warehouse.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:36]** The smaller one and then the double door.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:40]** And there was a window on the smaller door where I'm standing.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:43]** So, like, can I roll a perception to see what's in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** On your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:47]** Okay.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:54]** So, it is going to be... It's going to be Narla Yalamis' turn.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:59]** Let's see what she is going to do because I have a feeling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** Give me one second.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:08]** Let's just avoid these people.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:10]** If we take all the cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:12]** It's okay to walk away.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** That's the plan for sure.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** I agree with you.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:20]** As long as we can get away from them and not get swapped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:25]** If Silverton is in there and he's not a reptoid and doesn't have any clue, he's just going to be like, what the fuck is happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** Well, we could tell him.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** I know.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:28]** He's kind of an idiot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** We can't radio to him.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** We'd have to just yell at him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** Yeah, just yell, they're reptoids.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:36]** Well, I could, well, no, I don't know where he is.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:39]** You reptoid scum are not going to get your greasy hands on us.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** Sorry, where is that?

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** That's where it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:44]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:47]** I don't know what Narla's class is.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:53]** I just know Orgat was the one that was a mystic that could, like, stretch her jaw and become, like, a monster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:55]** Yeah, she was a bad a**.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** Okay.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** They can't go through you though.

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** Occupied space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** Nope.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** What are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** We were measuring a moment ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:06]** Again, the metagaming is just wild.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** It's all good.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** You're just guessing left and right.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:12]** Okay, so I'm just being a douche.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** No, really?

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:25]** So from inside the training center where you see the dimly lit flickering of torches, here's Colin and Rick.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:32]** You hear this faint sound, and right in front of the door,

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:32]** Thank you.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:36]** Gnarla is going to cast grease.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** Grease lightning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** Go grease lightning.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** Grease lightning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:44]** As this puddle appears in front of the door.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:47]** This is 35 feet underneath Hears.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:51]** That's great.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** Where that white rectangle is.

**[00:42:54 - 00:43:02]** Hears, you are going to need to give me an acrobatics check.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** Let's see.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:04]** 16.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** 16.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Okay.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** You are good.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:09]** You do not fall prone.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** So you are good to go.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:18]** But if you all are going to move through the space, you will need to roll some further athletics or acrobatics checks.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** And then Narla runs out.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:26]** She is going to run out and stand next to Shay.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:28]** Okay.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** That is her turn for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:54]** how do i want to do this how do we want to do this it's going to be the top of round two all the other it's the top around two and it is here's fabricius's turn here's like you know does like uh here's just shouts everyone like stick to the plan uh we've been found out just get just get out as soon as possible

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:57]** And then he's going to go through this goop.

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:00]** And then I think roll another acrobatics check to see if he can make it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:02]** Yeah, roll another acrobatics check to see if you can get through.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:04]** F***ing seven.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:07]** You fall prone.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:11]** Face plant into the ground.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:34]** yeah yeah you are currently prone so that was your move action to you started to move fell prone you still have your standard action if you want to i think probably stand up because you can use that you could just crawl five feet you could just crawl five feet forward too if you wanted to is there any there's no way i could then continue my movement to like get in there right because that's a standard action so i can't


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:58]** after that the door's open right the door's crawl the door's open so you can just crawl in if you want it right it's a double door but how how far can i crawl in is my question that's kind of what i'm getting at you can move five feet all right cool perfect so i'm out of that ooze now okay you're out of the ooze you crawled in five feet you are prone on the ground yeah okay okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:09]** All right, it is Shea Dyche's turn because Rick19 moved in the last round due to the ready action.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:16]** Shea is going to take a step forward, Colin.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:26]** He pulls out this badass looking axe and he is going to swing at you, Colin.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** That's a 28 to hit.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:59]** 12 points of damage as this axe just comes straight through the air just gashing into your side okay rick 19 what do you want to do you just saw in front of you colin just get like i don't know just freaking hit with this bad axe uh rick is going to you wanted to do a perception check uh yeah do a perception check on the door okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:04]** That's a three on the die for a total of ten.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:06]** Okay.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:06]** I don't see anybody.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** Hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:13]** You don't know what you see.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:24]** Rick19, you see that there's all this smoke and fog and you can see some slivers of light that are illuminating the ground in front of you.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:28]** And there's all this fog that's swirling with this orange light.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:33]** And you can make out that there are several figures moving through the warehouse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** That's what happens.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:37]** Time to get out.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:43]** Remember, your bio signatures are all in the cars, all of the automobiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:47]** So Rick is going to take a... Can I move back?

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:51]** What is the rules on getting through the grease?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:59]** If you're going to step through grease, you move at half your normal speed, and you need to give me an acrobatics check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** And an acrobatics check?

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** Yes.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** Okay, I got it.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:06]** Good number there.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** 16 for 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** Okay, you are good.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:14]** You're able to just skate by like you're walking in your socks on grease.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** Nailed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:20]** I'm going to move all the way down past the doors.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** You're just going to run away.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** You're just going to run back to your room and sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:27]** No, I'm stepping backwards.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:33]** That's probably why he doesn't slip is because he's just like tactically backing up through that.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:44]** And then he's going to back until he could see that the second door crosses peripheral and he's going to open fire on Colin.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:49]** Which I get a minus four because you were in my way.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** Yeah, for soft cover.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:55]** Yeah, it's all right.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Take it.

**[00:47:55 - 00:48:00]** That's a five on the die for a 14 minus four for 10 to hit.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** So, nope.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:01]** Doesn't happen.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:04]** So, I step back and shoot the wall.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** Okay.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** I'm trying not to hit you.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:09]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:12]** He tells you as he backs up, like, call it to the cars now.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:13]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** Woo!

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:17]** The heat is on now.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** Okay.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Colin Edenbrand, what are you doing?

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:23]** You've been hit from the side with this crazy axe.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:26]** Hears and Dr. Okay, you know, are in the garage.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Rick is trying to cover your exit.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** What are you going to do?

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:32]** Colin's thinking it's time to get the f*** out of here.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:38]** He's going to cast Fatigue on Shea Daisha.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:40]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:43]** He gets an AoO on you because you're casting a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** He does not get an AoO.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:48]** Casting this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** Well, that sounds like a typo.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** And he doesn't have a melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:53]** Oh, he does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:55 - 00:49:03]** I make a melee attack against that target's EAC using my key ability score.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:08]** That is a 17 against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:14]** 17 against EAC for Shea Dysha.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** Yeah.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** Meet the beats, baby.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** Hey-o.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** Hey-o.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:18]** Cool.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:20]** Talk to me about fatigue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:28]** So Shea Dysha is now fatigued, has the status of fatigued for the next five rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:32]** Status of fatigued for the next five rounds.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:32]** Okay.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:35]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** Not cool.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:38]** Make a fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** No, you make a fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:44]** So fatigue gives you a minus four penalty to all skill checks.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** And you cannot run or charge.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** That's a nine.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** That fails.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:49]** Fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** Okay.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** Yeah, you were saying, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** I was trying to read the condition.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:56]** And a minus one to the armor class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:01]** Archives of Death is fatigued.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** Oh, no, that's Pathfinder fatigued.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:09]** You can neither run nor charge and take a minus one penalty to your armor class.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:16]** Attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, add strength to damage...

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:30]** strength reflex saving throws initiative checks strength and dexterity based skill and ability checks and the amount of bulk you carry with becoming encumbered is reduced by one yep so all that stuff for the next five rounds


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:56]** good play yeah unfortunately it still allows for aos i think it does now colin is going to run away through the grease okay so you move at half your normal speed and you need to give me an acrobatics check um i believe shay gets an attack of opportunity first oh just from moving yeah through okay that's right with a minus one

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** With a minus one.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** With a minus one.

**[00:50:59 - 00:50:59]** Okay.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** From fatigue.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** Oh, from the fatigued.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:01]** Thank you.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:02]** Preach.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:03]** Okay.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** That is eight points.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** Let me double check that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** Are you going to roll to hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:08]** Sorry.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:10]** Six points of damage.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** Yeah, that was a 30.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:12]** Jeez.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** So, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** That was originally a 31.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** Fuck me.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:19]** Sorry, it was a 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:24]** It's been a while since we played combat.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** It's been a while since we played combat.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:29]** It's been a while since we played combat.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** Colin is running away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:32]** Trying to cover his retreat.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** How many points of damage?

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Six.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** Cool.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:43]** Colin turns his back and Shay buries his axe into his hamstring.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** Or into his quads.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:47]** And just like...

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:49]** And he turns and books.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:51]** You need an acrobatics check.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:52]** Is that what you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** You need an acrobatics check.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:53]** Okay.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Doesn't AOO halt your movement?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:56]** No.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** It doesn't.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** It halts the casting of spells.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** It does not halt movement.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** That's a nine.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:15]** So the hobbling of his quad is just like he can't maintain his balance and just like... You slip and fall prone at that first five feet that are right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:17]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:44]** yeah and that's my ready okay uh let's see it's gonna be dr okay's turn what are you doing you are the furthest away from the combat you're in the garage itself looking in front of the police cruisers yeah um so i'm gonna need to put on my environmental protections right yeah if i'm just gonna hang in here

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:47]** If you're going to stay in here, you're going to need to throw them on.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** I think you can probably... I don't... Let's see.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** Is that move action?

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:57]** Fire and mental protections.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** Starfinder.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:06]** You would think they would just automatically activate, but... Yeah, I don't think you need to do a move in order to do it.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** I'm going to say that you don't need to.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:08]** So, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** What do you want to do?

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:13]** I'm going to open the door to this car.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:16]** Is it one person in this car?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** Each cruiser can have two people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:22]** And then this one is four people?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** The truck is four people.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:23]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:25]** Okay.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:30]** Yeah, I'm just going to step up to the first car in the line.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:30]** Police cruiser?

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** Okay.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:34]** And me and Bernice are going to get her warmed up.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:38]** Give me a perception check, Doctor, okay?

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:40]** That is a...

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** It was a 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** Yeah, you nail it.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:54]** You get in and see that the cars have been tampered with, you think not by hearers, but by someone.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:59]** They are not horribly... It still seems like it's going to work.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:01]** It's not like they don't work.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:10]** But you think that you're going to need to do some sort of engineering check in order to bypass whatever system they've done to prevent the vehicle from...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:33]** starting fun uh can i do that yeah yeah i'd say that that would probably be your standard action okay i got a 28 28 you recognize it immediately you're like oh i know exactly what they did here hey they uh they juiced the cars i'm gonna try and get these uh up and running


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** I'll take a look at the one to the left.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** He says while prone.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:41]** Yeah, he's just trying to get up as he says this.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** Nice.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** Glaring at Rick from behind him.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:46]** Glaring through the back of his head.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** Okay, good turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** Do you think we weren't going to get into a fight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:53]** Yeah, I think there was a way around this, and I don't think so, necessarily.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:55]** I think you should not try to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** You would have been like, hey, we're going to go to the garage.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:57]** No big deal.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:01]** And then they're like, what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** We would have said something else.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:05]** We wish to join your reptoid cult.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:09]** Yeah, we were reptoids all along as well, I swear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:13]** You guys weren't reptoids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** Wait, what?

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** Really?

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** What?

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:19]** Crazy.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:23]** So that language in the training room was the Reptoid language, I'm guessing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:25]** You don't know.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** You don't know.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:29]** Sorry, we speak another dialect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:33]** I speak Reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** Wow, Kev, that's crazy.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** You just happened to speak that.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** That's so wild.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:41]** That's not suspicious at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** I was actually a Reptoid Studies major in college.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:46]** Wild.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** All right.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** It is...

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:52]** It is going to be... Let's move this.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** Let's move this.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:55]** It's going to be Gnarly Yalamis' turn.

**[00:55:56 - 00:56:04]** Good move from Dr. OK going in, realizing what the kind of shunt is that they put on the vehicle to prevent it from starting.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** You're like, oh, I did this when I was a child.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** So you f***ing nail it and get it out of the way.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** Here's is prone.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** Colin is prone.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** Rick19 is down the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:15]** He used to break the dean of our college.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Same trick.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:19]** The idea that...

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:19]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** used to boost cars as a kid.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:27]** I love that headcanon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** All right.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** Let's see.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** What do I want to do here?

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:33]** Okay.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:37]** I know what I'm going to do.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:40]** I'm going to get all the other NPCs in the base to attack you.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:40]** That's Colin.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** Gnarla.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:46]** strides forward 10 feet confidently.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:56]** And maybe as you fall, you look back and you see her just have this look of pity on her face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:58]** Suspended in midair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:58]** Yeah.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:58]** Oh.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:21]** floating uh no she's not floating she's she's she's just walking but she speaks quietly enough that i'm sure others could hear it but you feel like it's directed at you and she says she raises one hand out as she casts magic missile on rick 19 all the while just looking at you

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:27]** And there is a like, there's like just an eerie, uncanny valley that comes over her face.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:31]** And she says, Colin, just come with us.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:34]** You know what awaits.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:40]** And I'm going to use magic missile on Rick 19.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:49]** Rick19, you are going to take, since it's just a standard action, that's going to be, I think, 2d4, right?

**[00:57:50 - 00:58:02]** And if I can find a d4, then I would friggin' roll it and damage you, because that's all I want to do is I stall for time and take every f***ing dice out of my f***ing dice tray looking for a d4.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:04]** Literally, where the f*** is a d4?

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** Jesus Christ.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:06]** Cool.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:10]** You just showed us this fancy, like, new rolling on foundries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:12]** Yeah, I don't do that, but you should.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:18]** I like the actual feel of the roll.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** That's 10 points of damage as he's two.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Two, two, four, and a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:24]** It's actually only seven points of damage.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** Okay.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:33]** Because as the first missile hits, it hits him in the shoulder, and you see his armor kind of turn black as it hardens for half a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** So what I'm hearing is you get hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:37]** The magnets come forward and protect him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:37]** Got it.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** Two, two.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:39]** That's pretty cool.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** Pretty dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** All right.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:41]** Jealous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:42]** Jealous.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** Yeah, I know, right?

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:43]** It's pretty dope.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** It's pretty dope.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** Yeah.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:52]** Wow, I'm glad that Grease took y'all out so efficiently.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** That's great.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:54]** Let's see.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** What do I want to do here?

**[00:58:55 - 00:59:05]** I would say, Colin, you start to... Colin, you think you maybe hear footsteps coming down the hallway that's up and around the corner.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** Okay, we're going to move into round three here.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:13]** And, whew, okay.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:20]** I'm going to have, give me one second here, ladies and gentlemen.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:23]** Let's see, what do I want to do with this?

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:29]** Here's, what are you doing at the top of round three?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:36]** Here's wants to get up and move, but I don't know if that's going to take his entire action because I can't remember.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** Will that?

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** Okay.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:42]** What he wants to do is, like, get this larger vehicle ready to drive.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:45]** Because he's aware that there are these restrictions in place.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:46]** He would like to do that this round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** The truck.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** The truck.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:50]** Yeah.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:50]** Okay.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:52]** Standing up from prone is a move action, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** That's correct.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:53]** Brilliant.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:57]** So I can double move and then nothing else.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:58]** Yeah.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** So that's great.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:06]** So here's this going to move up to the front of the car and wait, I guess.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** Okay.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** Move up to the front of the car.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:15]** I guess he can't get in freely, I imagine.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:18]** I'd say that's to open the door and go in.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:22]** He's just getting out his toolkit.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** Or he's getting ready to, I should say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:37]** I think in the same way that you can pull a weapon as you move, we'll just say for flavor that as you're walking and you get up and you're stumbling a bit, you reach in and pull out your toolkit that's maybe on the back of your datapad or something.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:41]** Yeah, as he's getting his toolkit out, he's like, you know,

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:46]** He's like, you know, things are going so smoothly, but I guess it was too much to ask that things would end that way.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** As he's, like, fiddling with his tools.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:53]** You remember that this vehicle, from what you remember last night, was good to go.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:57]** There were no, like, biometric sensors or locks that you needed to futz with here.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** We'll see what, yeah.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** Oh, okay.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:08]** Dr. O'K saw that with the police crews that Dr. O'K went in and subsequently aced super well.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:11]** We'll see if it's something like that.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:38]** cool cool cool all righty what to do what to do shea daisha is fatigued for another four rounds narla has walked forward and is trying to coerce colin by speaking to him as colin is prone on the ground in this puddle of grease colin can i roll a mysticism check to see if colin does know what happens next like what she's talking about

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** You know what awaits?

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** Is what she said.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** Sure.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:47]** It's a 25.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:52]** You get the feeling in the back of your head.

**[01:01:54 - 01:02:20]** of a cold steel barrel yeah that sorry that was me oops sorry i was just rick looking for somebody to shoot he's already on the ground sorry hate when it does that it's got a mind of its own it's on brand it's on brand something in the back of your head yeah and it feels like you just you can't you can't quite picture or feel what it is but you feel like

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:24]** You feel like there are people that are expecting you.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:31]** And it's at... It's at that time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:33]** Oh, look, John Gaslighting us again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:38]** It's going to be on rails just like it was when we escaped from there.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** We're going to go on.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:45]** It's going to be like a little Autopia part of Disneyland where we're just on a little track and then we can barely turn the wheel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:47]** The metagame is strong with us this episode.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:47]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:50]** The metagame is strong.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:53]** It's a higher metachlorian count than I've ever seen before.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:57]** Jokes, jokes, jokes, jokes.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:04]** The door to the warehouse opens.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:07]** Oh, ****.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:20]** And the very imposing, power-armored figure with a ****-ass look on his face of jocks her opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:21]** Holy ****.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:23]** Slips and busts his **** on the grease.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:25]** And that's our game.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:25]** Oh, ****.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:37]** No, knowing this guy, this hefty, beautiful species of a thing, he's not going to... Do you also see behind him two other stewards?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** This is popping off, gentlemen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** It is popping off.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:45]** You know, I have to say, I had no idea it was going to go this way, truthfully.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:46]** Yeah, I didn't either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:48]** What did you think was going to happen, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:51]** Let's talk about it at the plot armor.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:54]** I can tell you more about what the... When is plot armor?

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** I forgot that.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:58]** After you're all dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:04]** This does sound very similar to Mothership at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** That's crazy.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:14]** I didn't even get to do any of my Dom Toruto quotes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:16]** Yeah, that's right.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** Kelly, did you do the quote?

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** He did it last time.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:20]** Oh, okay.
