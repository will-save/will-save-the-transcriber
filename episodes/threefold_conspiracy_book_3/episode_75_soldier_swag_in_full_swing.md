**[00:00:48 - 00:00:48]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:00:48 - 00:00:51]** It's written in stone.

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:53]** So let it be written.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:00:53 - 00:00:54]** Is it limited to just cod?

**[00:00:54 - 00:00:56]** Like, that's kind of a...

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:22]** Yeah.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** It's everything cod.

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** Well, sign me up for that.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:25]** All cod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** All cod all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** Okay.

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:28]** That's it.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** All cod all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:31]** Yeah.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:33]** That's it.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:33]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** Cool.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:36]** I will not be listening to that.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:36]** Sorry.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:36]** No.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:38]** That would be a terrible podcast.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:38]** We should not do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** I think we should do that.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** I'm down.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** Let's just pivot.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:45]** We should ask our listeners what they want.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:45]** Yeah.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** We'll make that a coffee exclusive.


## Speaker_0

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** It's just me.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** And I am also the guest.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:54]** And I just talked about Confucius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** John Swan.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:58]** It's nice to meet you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:01]** It's John with a bunch of terrible accents.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:03]** That's it.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** That's the whole podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** It's all the NPCs he never gets to put out.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:09]** I like that idea.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:14]** I think we would do Wheel Save, like W-H-E-E-L.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:15]** Wheel Save?

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** It would be Wheel Save Wednesdays.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** It's a car show?

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** It's a car show.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:42]** yeah and it's that's great it's kelly and i waxing nostalgic on on early 90s nissans um yeah we talked about the the physics of drifting and like the forces involved with top drag and then you know maybe we've got like a car meetup every so often depending on where we're at


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** I like this idea.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:49]** And I think Kevin could be a contributor, too, because we talked about how I joined a car club.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:56]** And then he was like, I joined a car club once, but it was a bunch of teenagers asking me to buy them drinks the entire time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:57]** It was my dad.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** He was the only one over 21.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** They were like, hey, man, come join our club.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:03]** And then they were like, did you bring us beer?

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:07]** I was like, no.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** That's amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** We'll attach Kevin to the top of cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** That's it.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** He'll be the tenor Faust to our top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:15]** Hey, I'm really good at troubleshooting problems.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:21]** So if anybody wants to call in, I can Google the crap out of it and figure out what's wrong with your car in probably half an hour.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** Can I just be on for the game?

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:27]** Did you guys ever listen to Car Guys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** Yeah.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** Who would you be?

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** I love that show.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:33]** That was a great show.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:35]** It was so funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** I would love to do a Top Gear style.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** Okay.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:44]** Our chemistry and energy reminds me of Top Gear sometimes.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:47]** So I really think that we could do something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** We could definitely do Top Gear.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:54]** I would love to be Jeremy Clarkson if he wasn't so like... Insane?

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** He's so funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:58]** He's so funny.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:01]** Who would be Captain Slow?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:02]** Oh, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:06]** Without a fucking doubt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:10]** Although Richard Hammond is kind of Kevin-esque too.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** It's like hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** He's also small.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:18]** No, I kind of want to be the driver who's masked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** Oh, the Stig.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** I could see that actually.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** That'd be cool.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** Or Richard Hammond.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:28]** And Will is Mr. Roman.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** He's the director.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:36]** I'm just the guy sending you on all these messages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:43]** We're out there doing our thing and he's like, cool, let me just throw a wrench into whatever they're doing.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:47]** Now you get to do whatever you're doing with three flat tires.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:55]** And then we would slowly develop a narrative and a plot line around the director and his life and how he's starting to change and come in, and it would be this fucking awesome thing, and I'd be down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:56]** Yeah, this is good.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** This is great.

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:02]** We could pivot into some kind of streaming show at some point for something completely unrelated.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** You never know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:06]** Can we have the game where they show...

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:29]** where where where they show the like zoomed in part of a car and then and then you guess what car it is you know we could do something like that yeah i would love that do you do that from time to time yeah well they don't make releases yeah like yeah we could do your cooking show that is yeah this is true maybe maybe we'll we'll we'll do some driving stuff too though all right

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:32]** We'll cook the... I don't know.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:33]** I don't know where that was going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** I was trying to think of a name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** Wasn't Dadius going to have a cooking show?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:40]** We'll do another cooking show bit at some point.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:43]** We've already talked about it and we know what we're going to do.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:45]** We've drawn from that well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:48]** What's with that reaction, Kevin?

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** I'm excited for it.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:52]** I love your cookie bit.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** I'm looking forward to more of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** We're going to do a fun little thing.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** That'll be fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:01]** Does anybody else have any thoughts on what else we could be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** Your thoughts, please.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** In the same...

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** light of our previous suggestions.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:18]** Well, save the podcast as in, well, we'll talk about the water table and creating your own water supply from groundwater.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:20]** And I'm very good at this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:23]** John and I went down to Guatemala to help with some well issues.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:42]** yeah it was good we put in like a hundred pounds we saved the well it was good right so we did it'll be a show in which we discuss you know how to properly maintain your well uh keep it safe so that you know no children are you know if you if you're


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:41 - 00:07:04]** you know don't fall down a well uh yeah if you're going to have a turn have a colleague that will find you and yeah yeah tell your neighbors to save you yeah i mean there are some real challenges with being on well water i had a i had a really nice a the pressure switch flipped on the uh the pump that pulls water out of the well

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:08]** no water until somebody came and had a look at the switch and cycled it.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:09]** Yeah.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:14]** We've probably talked to this before, but that's what John, John and I went down to Guatemala to help with a group called common hope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:16]** And they're really great nonprofit.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** Just check them out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:43]** they had a uh like a cistern that wasn't being used a big concrete vault that wasn't being used and then they had a well that was dug 100 feet less than they were told because in guatemala there's like no regulations on anything so the guy that dug the well was like yeah i'll take 200 feet down and he only dug 100 and so we had to help out with that and we put in two different pumps and we had a backflow

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:51]** So they could fill up their cistern and have at least 24 hours of fresh water in case their pump went down in the well.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** And that would give them time to repair the well instead of losing water altogether.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** It was a really fun project.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** It was awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:03]** And then we're standing there about to like take a photo in front of the filtration system.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:10]** And then we hear this like knocking sound and we turn around and one of the pipes just because like water hammer and the pressure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:16]** And so it was partially my fault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:21]** So what you're telling me is, Kevin, you're responsible for destroying a well in Guatemala.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** It was just an elbow.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** There was an elbow that we didn't glue in.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** Was it properly sealed?

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:29]** It was supposed to be a 24-hour set, and we only waited about six hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** 24 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:34]** That's what it does.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:37]** Because they had shut off water for the whole campus.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:41]** So they were only using these massive buckets.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** So we were on a time crunch.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:44]** We were like, all right.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** It'll cure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** It'll set in six hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:48]** It'll be fine.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** Always listen to directions, kids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** It was even worse.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:58]** We put it together and we glued it and everything, but we had two separate glues.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** There was a quick set and a 24-hour.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** I thought we used the quick set.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:08]** The guy that handed me the glue didn't tell me otherwise and couldn't confirm or not.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:10]** I was like, I think it was the quick set.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** And it wasn't.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:14]** Oops.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:19]** We just glued it back together and told him not to turn it back on for another 24 hours.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:22]** And then we all left.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** You doubled down on the 24 hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:27]** You didn't switch to the quick set.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:54]** uh i think we ran out of the quick set was the problem and nobody said yeah something like that it was it was a weird situation and and right we had to leave like where our flights were out so we're like yeah so do you guys know if they have water oh yeah we got like a cot we got caught up we confirmed it literally a day later like a few people who weren't students who were under the engineers without borders umbrella which there's all this like red tape around how long we had these folks yeah uh

**[00:09:54 - 00:10:17]** confused quick set and long curing glue yeah we'll fix it and then it worked yeah that's good they send you a postcard with a photo of the new water feature in their village amazing amazing so we went in to fix a wall and we ended up giving him a fountain


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** I think a drink from it, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** Constantly flowing.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:29]** Any other ideas before the application window closes and then we open it up to our wonderful audience?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:32]** I honestly think we should stick to We'll Save the Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:34]** I think that we would be best at this.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** And then the driving thing.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** I think those are the two things we should do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:43]** I was going to say, we'll teach Kevin whether he likes it or not.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** It would be

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:50]** Vinny and Will explaining stuff in excruciating detail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:54]** Every time someone teaches Kevin something, it's very true.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** It's a huge f***ing thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:01]** This is the balance that I will never be able to strike with Kev.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:03]** Kev is never satisfied with a yes or no.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** He always wants more information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:07]** But then he doesn't want it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:15]** But the threshold between how much information Kev wants and how much information any normal human has on a topic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** Okay, I think I can help Kev.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:22]** It's kind of like, it's the breadth versus depth because people get into so much depth about it.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** I feel like maybe he wants the breadth only.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:29]** Yeah, but it's kind of like drinking from a well of information versus a fountain of information.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** Or a leaky pipe of information.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:37]** Or a leaky pipe of information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:41]** Kev wants the drips, but we didn't let it occur for long enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:55]** So next episode is... Just for our tech fans out there, we're using a port, 30,000 is our port, and I asked why 30,000 instead of something else.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** That was my question.

**[00:11:56 - 00:12:02]** And then Will ends up going into sending us an entire list of all the different ports that are used on a regular... Hang on, hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:05]** You started with, can we use a different port?

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** And I said, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:12]** And then you were like, why not?

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:18]** And then we explained why.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:18]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:21]** That's it.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** Fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** This is your cistern, Kev.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:25]** You didn't even ask that.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:27]** You were like, why not port one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** This could be the show, though.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** It would be a great show.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:38]** It would be, I come in and ask a question, and then after ten minutes, I stop listening, and it's you guys going on for an hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:43]** He goes off like, the screen goes like, you know, blank.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** It's just Kevin and Will.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:47]** No, I mean like Vinny and Will.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:49]** Just the, you know.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** Well, I love you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:55]** I really do.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:57]** I'm going to call out Will about one thing, too, while we're at this.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:00]** And it's fine because I understand.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** No, no, no.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:04]** It's more like this because as a developer, I kind of get it.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:11]** Like, we'll spend a lot of time, like, developing a solution that shortens, like, something else by, like, just a couple seconds.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:14]** But you spend a lot of, like, front time front loading it.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:19]** So then, like, Kevin wanted to do, like, publish, like, you know, updates to BIOS and stuff like that.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** And Will's like, cool, I got you.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:24]** I'm going to install a f***ing development environment on your, like, Mac or whatever it was.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:30]** And I'm going to, like, you know, put all this f***ing, like, you know, workflow in there so that you can just, like, push.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:35]** Instead of just logging into GitHub and just editing it.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** It was really funny to me.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** It's okay, though, Will.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:41]** I'm tempted to do that stuff, too.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:44]** Spending a lot of work to be lazy in the future.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** I like putting in the work to be lazy.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** That's why I also like that.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:48]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:51]** I like just being lazy up front.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:58]** Why spend an hour doing something when you can spend five hours automating it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** But you've saved a lot of time in the future.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** It's very important.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** It's very important.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:03]** This is true.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** Let's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** play.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** Let's get back into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:12]** I love it when you whisper that to me.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** Oh, okay.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** Well, you guys go way back.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** I don't know what you guys got up to way back when.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:25]** I mean, you know, if I've said that to Vinny before, then I've said that to... I think especially when you're young, like, you know, you don't know...

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** I don't know.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** You're close to your friends and stuff.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** You know, you're at that sleepover.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:30]** Yeah.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** And then you wake up in the middle of the night.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:35]** You're still figuring things out.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:35]** Let's play.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** Exploring each other.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:40]** John's just like breathing on the f***ing nape of your neck, like in the middle of the night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** I'm sorry, John.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:44]** I didn't expect this to go all the way there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:46 - 00:15:07]** throwaway comment that jurassic parking was really fun on the snes right yeah but uh let's play the promise that benny did spend a lot of time staying up late playing video games and then playing like dnd with a bunch of people really late so it's like that would happen


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** That is on brand for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:11]** Yeah, no, that's very, it's very on brand.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:13]** Do you want to sleep on the top or bottom bunk, John?

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** You're like, the top.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** You just kind of look at him like, I'm good to go.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** Bunk?

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** Twinkle.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:20]** We had bunks?

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:25]** Amazing.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** Anyway.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:30]** But that's none of my business.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:34 - 00:16:02]** liquid like Kermit the Frog in that meme he like curls his wrist up so then it looks like he's flexing kind of and turns 90 degrees yeah and he enters 90 degrees and then drinks vertically it's all started because he's joking half of us can't stand the sound of us drinking on microphones


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** I feel like we have to cut some of this.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** This is just too long.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:08]** No, this is a peak behind the curtain.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** We don't have to do anything.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:12]** This is our podcast.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:16]** We'll talk about drinking water all we want.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** And cod.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** Don't forget cod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** Oh, yes.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** It's just me.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** It's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:22]** It's fine.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** Keep it in.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** It's important for people to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:28]** Kelly, do you need to take another drink?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:30]** No, it's fine.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** I have water now.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:34]** You sound like you smoked about two packs in the last ten seconds.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** Yeah, truly.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:39]** Dude, here's smoking got me into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** Classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:45]** Who's trying to fit in in the wrong crowd?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:47]** We should act.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:48]** Here's a PSA.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:49]** Don't smoke.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:52]** We have some characters that are very cool.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** All our characters, they're good.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** Don't smoke.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** It's cool, but don't do it.

**[00:16:56 - 00:17:00]** They're stage cigarettes, you know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Yeah.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:05]** As soon as you're cut, then... Definitely not into smoking funny cigarettes.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** Yeah, don't smoke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** Funny cigarette.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** Here's his raspy voice.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** It's not coming from that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:11]** Anyway.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:15]** Maybe the four of you haven't smoked some funny cigarettes.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:24]** Because aboard the Void Crier, your rescue vessel back to the packed world.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:29]** A subversion is occurring.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:36]** Our four survivors, you all, were investigating a missing period of time.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** 24 hours.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:38]** Hours.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** Hours.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:40]** Hours.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** Aboard the ship.

**[00:17:44 - 00:18:03]** Through the use of hypnosis, Colin was able to have subjects re-experience the dreams, memories, and one by one, memory by memory,

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:20]** The four of you pieced together the details of an abduction, discovering that each member of the Void Crier had been taken, thank you, Ice, and experimented on.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:26]** Maybe even communicated, somehow, with the Grace.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:29]** Now, you also discover...

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:37]** That there is a device called a drift shadow projector that prevents spacecraft from using its drift drive.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:46]** This was your impetus moment, your inflection point, because the device only works within 10 hexes, meaning the ship is nearby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:49]** And you're like, there's a 15, but it was 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** You can go back.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:52]** It's like the other cargo bay.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** Now, sharing this.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:57]** You were wrong on the other card.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:57]** I don't know, man.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** You can go back and listen.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:58]** It's there.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:02]** Sharing this with Narla and Shay.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:07]** You all speak with Torv and Melt the Man.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:10]** And you head up to the bridge.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** You all decide.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:15]** Narla takes in some good feedback from y'all.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:19]** To break free from the Shadow Projector's grasp.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:24]** And possibly simultaneously attack this hidden craft.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** Fire on it.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:26]** Break free.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:37]** Yet right as you do, Shay and Narla collapse as their faces emit this huge amount of pain.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:45]** And Ezra, Fitch, and Sarzael scream in unison and begin attacking you.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:59]** And you discover in their malicious glee that their willpower seems to maybe be overrun by some sort of aggressive turned to 11 programming.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:07]** So you fight in this close quarters space to detach them non-lethally.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:23]** And right at the end, when they're all unconscious, there's a voice that comes over the intercom from the captain's chair and says, Hello?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:29]** Is anyone there who hasn't gone completely f***ing homicidal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** And you all are back.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:36]** I brought you over in foundry to the bridge.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:44]** There are five unconscious bodies in front of you, and this transmission has come over the comms.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** What are you doing?

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:49]** Rick is close enough to the captain.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** It's coming from the captain's chair, you said?

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** It's coming from the captain's chair, yep.

**[00:20:52 - 00:21:02]** Yeah, he's right next to the captain's chair, so he's actually just going to reach out and hit the comm button and kind of put it on speaker mode and say, identify yourself.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** This is Keniko Breeze.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:07]** Identify yourself.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** My name is Rick 19.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:12]** I am aboard the Void Crier.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** Where is your location?

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:16]** I am also aboard the Void Crier.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:17]** Rick, do we know this person?

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** I'm sorry.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** My memory sucks.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** You would remember...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:36]** that narla shea maybe even in passing at the brutars match they mentioned that one of the pikes peritons took pretty heavy injuries sustained some intense injuries and was in the med bay

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:42]** This is Kaniko Breeze, and I am in the med bay.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** I already said my name once.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:48]** I am in the med bay, and there is, you hear this pounding on the door.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:59]** There is a, I don't know, somebody outside who's trying to get in, and they don't sound friendly, and I could use some help, Mr. Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** Copy that.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** We are on the bridge and had to take out several of the Pyke's Peritons.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:05]** They're all alive, mind you.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** None of them are dead, but they also attacked us.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** Okay, good.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:11]** We will handle the situation here and make our way to Medbay as soon as we can.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:12]** Hold tight.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:15]** Okay, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:21]** And you can faintly hear Torv's voice in the background saying, We know you're in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** And I need you to... I like Torv.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:32]** I would really appreciate the faster that you get here because I am still not feeling great.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** So please hurry up.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** Thank you.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** Really appreciate it.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** And they go off comms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:45]** Rick kind of just looks it around and then looks at the three of you and just goes, what now?

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** Do we split up?

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:54]** We cannot leave all of them here and not understand what is going on here, but we also need to rescue Kaniko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:00]** Can we do a check to see if they're going to be re-conscious?

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** Wow, I can't really put that well right now.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** Can we leave them alone, passed out?

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:04]** Is there...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Yeah.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** I want to ask a slightly different question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:14]** To Kelly's question, yeah, they are unconscious but stable.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:18]** And they've sustained damage from you all.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:22]** It's not like they just fainted and they'll wake up in a minute or 30 seconds.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:25]** They are unconscious, but they are stable.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:28]** And you could probably, I mean, you all use non-lethal damage.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:37]** I don't think you even need to do any sort of recuperative or rejuvenative stability check.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:37]** Will, your other question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:50]** Yeah, I mean, can we discern kind of what mechanism or spell they're under that would have caused them to go so AWOL?

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:50]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:50 - 00:24:02]** So there's not too – if you go over and check them, physically it doesn't seem like they have any sort of device in them.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:17]** Maybe if you think through any sort of mysticism or physical science, you think that there might have been a programming that was put into them that was set to –


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:41]** caused this yeah finney i this sounds a bit like the the the insect you're talking about had the the the fear through that speaker i mean could could they be using back on yeah that that thing that you told me about i did not hear any sound why did it not affect us


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** We didn't go in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** That's why.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:46]** But if we did, it probably would have affected us.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** I think we would have to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** No, I mean here.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:51]** Why were we not affected and the rest of the five of them were?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:54]** Colin, the gray, I feel it's the grays.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** They have a lot of tricks up their sleeves.

**[00:24:56 - 00:25:03]** You weren't there for this, but we saw people just drop dead that presumably had some kind of thing that they put in their heads.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** We're pretty sure it's the grays.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** That's our working hypothesis anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:13]** Doctor, okay, can you make sure that they do not have bombs in their necks before we depart?

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:16]** And should we bind them in case they do come to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** I agree with both of those.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:22]** I'm also going to try some mystic stuff, and I feel like Colin, you could too, probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:26]** I will walk over and examine them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:31]** Yeah, they don't appear to have any bombs in their neck.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** It's pretty clear if there's going to be something there.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** They don't seem to have anything.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:37]** Colin, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:40]** I'm looking for dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:45]** Found them.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:47]** Found you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:56]** I think I want to roll a mysticism check to see if I can identify why they are just like all topsy-turvy and shit.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:59]** As John nods.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:00]** 19.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** I also rolled a 19.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** Wow, that's impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:21]** You know that there are psychosomatic devices, methods of persuasion, that when you think back to your memories and how they were speaking with the Greys, that there's some subversive programming that was used there.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:31]** But in terms of mysticism of any, like, magic or maybe I'm thinking anything, let's call it extra scientific, yeah.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** No, you can't think of anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:33]** Okay.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:43]** So there's not any sign that I can see that this is a mystic source.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:50]** It could just be a psychotic program that these greys have put into them.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** Dastardly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:55]** Also known as thought reform.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:04]** Would that require some kind of device in order to host such a program, or is it purely a biological?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:12]** I think it's more experiential from the subject's point of view, perhaps, from what I understand.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:14]** It's like conditioning, purely.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:14]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** It is interesting that...

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:25]** The captain and Shay were affected but unaffected, as if they were able to overcome this reprogramming.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:30]** But I'm still concerned that the four of us were not even targeted by this program.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** Yeah.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:35]** Perhaps we were not under their effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:37]** The question now, though, is what to do next?

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** They had 24 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:41]** I mean, this could be those visions.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** Hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:42]** Hours.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** Yeah.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:43]** Hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** The memory.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:49]** Well, should we bind them and bounce, so to speak?


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:55]** Rick is going to try to wake up the captain.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:57]** Can I just do some kind of check?

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** Is it a medicine check or is that just shaking her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:09]** You recall from last time that I believe Colin did a series of checks to determine if that was going to be like a, hey, wake up.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:09]** What are you doing?

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:13]** And it seemed like they would probably, they're out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** Yeah, but that was before combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** Right, but the captain wasn't part of the combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:17]** Right, right.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:19]** But now we're through the combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** Nothing changed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** Nothing's changed.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:21]** Okay.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Who was the most dangerous?

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** Probably... This guy's got four arms.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** I think I only have one set of binders.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Which doesn't make sense.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** I feel like I would have at least a couple.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:34]** I mean, I have some Kasathan microcord.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:39]** But I don't know if that's enough to really... How much comes in that?

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** I think it was like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** Let's find out.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:46]** Let's find out.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:53]** There's no length listed according to Aon SRD.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:59]** So I don't think that you decided to buy the 10-foot cable.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:02]** It's like you can buy the 50-foot cable.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** Six inches.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** You don't need the small connector.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** It's a single thread of microcord.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:13]** It's just a filament of it.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** It's not the full thing.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:18]** Yeah, you'd have enough to probably tie them up.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** It's not a problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:24]** I say we bind up at least the Pyke's Peritons.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:29]** Hard argument, but what do we do with Shay and the Captain?

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:32]** They were also targeted, but it didn't work.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Do we bind them as well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** I think we leave them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:40]** I think perhaps we leave them.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** It's probably fine.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:51]** And I would just stack these bodies next to each other, you know, like in a cartoon, wrapping around them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:53 - 00:30:00]** And I think with that... I'm not the expert in binding things.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** Here you go, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** All right.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** I'm going to move.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** Hand some microcord.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** A spool of microcord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:08]** All right.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:10]** Do I need to do some kind of check in order to tie them up?

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** No.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Okay, you're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:12]** You're fine.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:12]** All right.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:21]** Let's go before we don't have anyone else to talk to downstairs before it gets too hairy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:22]** Love it.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:39]** rick walks towards the elevator he puts his axe on his back and he he hauls up his artillery laser and just looks prepped dr k gets in the elevator wait which way is the med bay you are it's it's on the main deck yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:43]** And I was trying to pause the game, but it won't let me pause the game.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** So before you go to the main deck.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** Oh, okay.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** There it is.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:48]** The little thing wasn't coming up.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** I was trying to move Bernie.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:50]** Okay.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:52]** Just wait there in the elevator bay.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:53]** Yeah.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** Okay.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:57]** As you are coming down.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:07]** You hear the faint, like, boom, boom, like the sound of someone hitting the wall with a heavy object.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:13]** The game should be unpaused now if you want to come into the main deck.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:28]** And as you do, the elevator door slides open, and you see across the lounge, in the medbay hallway, you see first, of course, Ludvija.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:31]** Head nearly brushing the ceiling.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:41]** The metal on her burnished freebooter armor and the aggressive horns on her helmet glinting from the purple of her ember flame, Dashko.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:47]** And in front of her, you see Torv, who is just reaching over.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:47]** Boom!


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:47]** Boom!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:51]** Boom, slamming his fist, punching.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:54]** The last one's just like a punch right into the door.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:58]** And you hear, Kaniko, we know you're in there.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:01]** Your time for cooperation is over.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** We are letting ourselves in.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:14]** And he motions with two fingers, steps over a bit as Zudvaia starts to sizzle away at the door.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** You all...

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:23]** have a chance here because they haven't noticed you.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** So what are you going to do?

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:54]** uh wait so we're so i started blasting yeah so you have come down into the lounge area and about 20 feet away with the door open oh it's open okay i got you yeah it's not good all right and the med bay is is one of these side rooms right no the med bay is right in front of the door that they are at which is going to be over here oh to to to the left there's there's like a single lane hallway so we gotta get past these guys can i pause this for a second i don't know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:57]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:02]** John, the stream view used to move with the tokens.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:05]** It doesn't move with the tokens anymore.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:14]** I had to work through some module stuff, which I still haven't finished, but it involved turning off and then turning back on all the modules.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:14]** Gotcha.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** So do you need to adjust the stream view?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** I think I can make do for now.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:25]** I just need to take a minute to connect a mouse to it so that I can do the movement manually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:26]** Go ahead.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:29]** Well, the game's paused, so we can wait for just a second.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:35]** And while this time, let's share a word from our non-existent sponsor.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** Who's our sponsor, Will?

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:39]** Our non-existent sponsor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:42]** Our non-existent sponsor is Well Save the Podcast.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** Oh, great show.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:45]** Great show, man.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:55]** They're going to be talking about dry climate wells and keeping them well maintained this next week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:59]** I love this because I was going to bring it up, but I kept it to myself, but now I have a chance.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:09]** When we finished and we got the water running for the first time in Guatemala, they brought out champagne glasses and filled up the water from the well.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** And we were all like, cheers.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:16]** And then it exploded right behind us.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** So the picture is actually frozen.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:21]** It's great.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:25]** That's the cover for Well Save the Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:39]** us not performing a wall repair correctly it feels reminiscent of you know the roman engineers building a bridge and standing under it as they test it you know that's it yeah you think they did that

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** I'm sure that, yeah.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:44]** It could be apocryphal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:59]** It could also have been like, well, now that you've invested all of this capital and effort into building this, now let's see if it was worth cheap fodder.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:03]** You're the first to test it because it's on you, bud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:06]** It's on you now, so I don't know what you're going to do.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** But, yeah, that's amazing.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:10]** Roman and Hughes were pretty brilliant, though.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** All right, so what are you doing?

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:15]** You have an opportunity here, and Rick19, you stepped out of the elevator.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:17]** Are you going to roll a stealth check on that or no?

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:18]** I will.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:19]** Okay.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:22]** That is a 16 stuff.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:23]** Okay.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:29]** What is everybody else going to do?

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:33]** Colin is, I think, going to follow Rick stealthily.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** As stealthily as he can.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:37]** Roll stealth?

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:38]** Roll stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** Roll stealth, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:44]** That was a foolish choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:46]** Let's roll some stealth.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** What's your stealth move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** Before that...

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:55]** Dr. K is going to just pull out a Mark II pheromone grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** Okay.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:57]** That's fine.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** You can do it.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:58]** Yeah, that's a 10.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** That's a 10.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:04]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** There's a sizzle.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:17]** As he steps out of the elevator, I think he stumbles into one of Melt-A-Man's toolboxes.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:21]** And you just hear every single wrench inside.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** Just like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:30]** immediately Torv and Ludvija look over at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:35]** They just see Rick standing there with his giant artillery laser pointed at them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:38]** Yeah, it's really funny that you rolled stealth directly in front of them.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** I wasn't sure if that's what happened, but now I realize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:45]** Yeah, you did step out into their direct line of sight and then rolled stealth.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** And Colin, where did you step?

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** All right, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:50 - 00:37:17]** trying to look at the map here so the opening of the elevators to the right correct yeah yeah okay so then he would have stepped to the right and then around behind behind rick 19 okay so he's so he's behind rick 19 and when those tools fall over torv and leviah look over and tor just goes and you all need to roll for initiative


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** I figured.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:22]** We should shoot him in his big, dumb eye.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** Wow.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Yeah.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:26]** That's exactly right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** Uh, that's a 20.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:31]** Okay, give me one second there, Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** And, wow, that's amazing.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:34]** Give me one second there, Dr. Okay.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** I gotta, gotta get on.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:40]** Make sure you add yourself to the, uh, to the combat tracker.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** Of course he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:45]** Uh, if you right-click on your token, you'll see the shield with the crossed swords.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:49]** Oh, right, right, right.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** Y'all sure you betcha.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** How do I?

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Ludmo looks pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:56 - 00:38:01]** Levi is pretty dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:03]** Have we met this person before?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:07]** Can I enter the number or do I have to roll it on Foundry?

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** That's up to you.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** I rolled it.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** I can add it for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:14]** I can add it for you.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:18]** So what's your total initiative, Dr. O'Kane?

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Total initiative is 22.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:19]** 22.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** Rad.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:21]** Well done.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** What about Rick19?

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** What's your total initiative?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** 20.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** Okay, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** Yeah, it was a 16 plus 4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** Okay, Rick19, I don't see you in the combat tracker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:34]** Nope, I didn't go in the combat tracker.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** What do I got to do?

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** You have to right-click on your token.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** I don't want to do that.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** Talk about the lazy stuff earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:43]** You're playing a game on a virtual tabletop.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:46]** You just need to right-click on the token and then click on the sword and shield.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** Sword and shield.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** And I'm waiting.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** And there you are.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** All right.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** Good stuff.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** And you got my number in there?

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** Oh, he's got your number usually above your head.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:55]** You could roll to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:58]** Oh, he's got your number.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** All right.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:02]** That's going to be that for Shema.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:03]** Okay.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** And it is going to be.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:08]** I don't believe you asked for my number.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** Okay.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** And I don't think I asked for here's his number.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** So here's what's your number?

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:14]** It's 11, but it's already in the combat track.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:14]** Okay.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** Should be.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** All right.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** I think.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** Okay.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:17]** Yep.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** And then I think we're it.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** That's good.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:19]** All right.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** Let's get ready to start some combat.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:25]** Colin, what's your initiative?

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:27]** 1515.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:27]** Okay.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** I like it.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:31]** Let's begin the combat.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:33]** Colin, what is your dexterity bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:36]** Real quick.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Um... Plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** Plus four.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:41]** Ooh.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** Roll the d20 for me.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:44]** Dr. Ookie.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:45]** What did you get?

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** Oh, I got a 12.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:46]** Colin?

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** 12.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:47]** You got a 12.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** Okay.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:48]** Sounds good.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** All righty.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:50]** Let's get going.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:55]** It's going to be Dr. Okay, who pulled out their Mark II pheromone grenade.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:58]** You see across from you that they are looking.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:04]** You can't see Ludvaia from your position because I think you're maybe still inside the elevator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:07]** I mean, it's a tall vest, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:13]** Yeah, but from where you're at, you might be able to see them, but they are looking at the door.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:17]** So you mostly see Torv right there on the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** Maybe I see the little laser eye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** What color is Torv's eye?

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** It's red, isn't it?

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:24]** It's red.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Oh, he's got his laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:32]** Hey, you guys remember Watch Out for His Laser, which I explicitly warned us about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:36]** Do you remember that time we got the breakdown on...

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:41]** I should have actually just implanted an explosive on them during that.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Yeah.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:43]** Good job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:46]** Because that would have been really easy to do in a tiny room with Shay.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:49]** Hey, don't mind me.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:49]** Don't mind me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** Slide through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** Just a piece of dynamite with fuse.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:58]** That would be such a tabletop thing to do.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:03]** Hey, can I slide a grenade in this person's eyeball?

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** Don't worry about it.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** It's fine.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:06]** It's fine.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** It's fine.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Dr. K, what are you doing?

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:16]** I'm throwing this pheromone grenade that I picked up in the... You're throwing a pheromone grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:19]** Can I... Like, the door to the elevator is to the right.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:22]** So, like, where are you throwing this grenade?

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:25]** I'm right at Tor, like, the red-eyed monster.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:27]** So, are you, like, ricocheting it around some corners?

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:28]** Like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:31]** I think he's saying that you need to leave the elevator space.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** Oh.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:35]** Because, like, that rectangle is elevator.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** You could move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** So could I move forward?

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:39]** I feel like it's, like, more like a moving platform.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** It's just a platform.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Yeah.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** Sorry to retcon what I was saying before.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:47]** There's no, like, walls around the elevator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** Okay.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:48]** Yeah.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:58]** I was thinking about this a lot before we started this book, and that was the only configuration that I decided was the easiest one that made sense, so I apologize for kind of forgetting it.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:05]** But as soon as it... Like, it moves within chambers so that people don't just fall off, you know, and, like, Wilhelm scream.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** But there's, like, a half wall.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** Okay, cool.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:11]** As soon as you land, you can move wherever you want to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** So that was me.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** Perhaps, John, you can remind me of the grenade rules.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:17]** So the range is...

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:40]** it's right but if i go beyond the range right doesn't i think that's like any range increment you're gonna take a minus two right rick uh two or right yeah so for every range increment beyond what's your range from there it's 20 is the range yep uh so this is a 30 foot um so it'd be a minus four


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:41]** Minus two.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:42]** Minus two?

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:43]** Yeah.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:50]** So if you did 50 feet, then you would hit minus four because your two range increments passed your normal range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:53]** And then the DC is five.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:54]** Five?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** But you're targeting for a corner.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** So technically, if you're aiming right for that door, you should be at range.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** It's 20 feet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:22]** uh there's a i think it's a standard 20 feet it's still 25 feet to get to the to the square where the door is at and it's an ac5 so you're targeting the square yeah then throw it in there that's fine okay okay so what like you'd have to pick one of the corners between them then because you're aiming for a corner right is the way grenade rules specify that you aim for a corner


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:25]** Okay, so I'm aiming for this middle corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:27]** I'm going to, like, you know, throw it in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** DC 5 with a minus 2.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** AC 5 with a minus 2, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** Sorry, AC 5.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:33]** What did you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** 16.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Yeah, you're fine.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:39]** It's so easy to hit that.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** Oh, does the AC go up with the further away it goes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** That's what I was thinking.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:46]** The AC goes up further it's out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:52]** That might be a good thing too quickly.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:54]** You just got a minus two on your throwing penalty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** Well, let's just look.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:59]** I think it's for each range in tournament.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** It's like five.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:01]** Okay.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:01]** Yeah.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** I'm just trying to look and see.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:05]** I don't see anything here on A on SRD.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:10]** So, I mean, you rolled a 16.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:12]** So, I think it was in the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:15]** Which is Patty Mahomes, the sidearm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:15]** Yeah.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** Yeah, it's just, it's a ranged attack AC5.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:19]** Yep, that's it.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** Cool.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** You hit it.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** You throw the grenade.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** Tink, tink, tink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** What does the grenade look like?

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** This pheromone grenade.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:29]** I'm imagining it's a vial.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** encased in sort of like a shell.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:32]** Nice.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** Like an egg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Looks like an egg.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** And then when it hits, it breaks.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:38]** Yeah.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** Sweet.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** Alright, so you hit.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:43]** What happens and what do they need to roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:45]** So, the...

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:48]** Saving throw is a we'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** We'll save.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** We'll save.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** We'll save.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** And I was looking at the level.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:59]** So it's a Mark 2 pheromone grenade.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** Mark 2 pheromone grenade.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** Okay.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** Where do we get this again?

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:06]** We got it on the alien ship, I thought.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** On the outpost, Omicron.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:12]** We picked this up from the folks who were tending the Veracinate plant.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:12]** Right.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** Oh, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:15]** It deals no damage.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:27]** Instead, it disperses a powerful cocktail of supercharged pheromones and magically modified mind-altering chemicals in the listed blast radius, which is... Does it make a little save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:30]** Or they're dazzled for, what is it, four rounds?

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:30]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:31]** Fascinated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** Fascinated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:36]** For a number of rounds equal to the grenade's mark number as they gaze.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:40]** So it would be two rounds in one.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** So it's sparkling trails.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** I did.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** They are mark one grenades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:45 - 00:46:10]** so when i look back mark two you got two mark one grenades oh okay you have quantity two mark one grenades so you have two i thought it was a bigger grenade in fact i like split open and it's actually two it's it's it's like the popsicles that are coming like a long string and you have to rip them off you know what i'm saying yeah that's that's awesome okay great ones that are like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:29]** two popsicles in one pack that you've got to figure out how to break off equitably are the worst yeah that's very true right out there sorry yeah yeah love it or be dazzled okay no it sounds good fascinated fascinated oh wow fascinated is wow it's a little bit different than dazzled

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:30]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:32]** Versus Blind Death and Fear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** They just sort of stare out into space for a drone.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** Yeah, wow.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:35]** Okay.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:37]** Well, let's hope they have some good rules here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:40]** They also get penalized for poison spells.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** Yeah.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** Is this a spell-like ability?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:50]** I think... It's a mind-affecting effect.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:53]** It's a mind-affecting effect.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:58]** It can bypass environmental protections from a suit of armor.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** Okay.

**[00:46:59 - 00:46:59]** Yeah.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:00]** I'm not sure.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:03]** I've still not seen what DC it is, though.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:08]** I'm guessing it's like 15 or like 12, but it doesn't say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** They got a 21 and a 22.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** I rolled hella high with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** That's wasteful.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** Can't use another one for 24 hours.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:16]** Woo!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:20]** Oh, once they experience the pheromone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:23]** Like, once they save, you can't use the same one again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** Once they save.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** Okay.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:25]** All right.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:30]** So you throw this f***ing awesome grenade and just... Into the trash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:34]** It lands right in the trash can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:36]** It's just right in there.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:38]** Bounces off a bunch of surfaces and lands in the trash.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:42]** Closes the lid on its way in.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:47]** I imagine that the pheromone starts to affect them.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** Yeah.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:48]** Hey, I got you.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** And here we go.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** And especially Tord.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** You can see Tord's face.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:56]** Take it in and just shake it off.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:01]** I'm imagining that the programming is so deep.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:24]** just like it doesn't even phase them because they saved very well those are probably the best rolls that I've had in like weeks now honestly just on the GM side here I was hoping that they had weak wills given their circumstance but foolish of me at least I got two of these things I think they may have weak wills they just got really lucky


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:29]** So it's a good thing we got the strong will on our side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** There it is.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:34]** And speaking of Rick 19, what are you doing with your turn here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** First, I want to try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:40]** Oh, and Bernice is going to move out of the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** Okay.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** Is there something that.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:48]** I can roll to see if there's any way to get them to not... Like, I don't want to fight them.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** You know what I mean?

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** So is that a... I don't know.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:59]** Is that a life science or a physical science in order to know whether I can do anything besides just straight up knock them out in order to get them to come out of this?

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:01]** Good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:06]** Give me a...

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:27]** give me a physical science check rick and i think anybody who wants to give me a medicine check i will 18 physical science 18 physical science i got a 19 that is a plus 13 on my medicine check it's ridiculous i got a 17 plus 11 on medicine

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** Dude, y'all are crazy at Little Five.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** I think I stashed my medicine.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:35]** That's like your jam.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** You're jamming on it.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:38]** I think this is what happens.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:45]** Rick19, you and Colin and Dr. OK have the best line of sight.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:48]** You're just a little bit over in the lounge, right?

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** And with that pheromone grenade...

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:58]** There is something that clicks in the three of your heads and you're like, okay, so the pheromone didn't affect them.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:02]** This is me adding flavor narratively to the roles, right?

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** So the pheromone didn't affect them.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:07]** And you think, wait a minute.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:13]** Nico also wasn't affected, but she's awake still.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** She's awake somehow.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:23]** And you're like, well, Kaniko was being treated for her wounds.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:35]** Maybe there's something there in that treatment that has made whatever programming not take hold.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** And maybe that's something to investigate.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** That's what the three of you get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:46]** But we have to get past that mother trucker.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Yeah.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:47]** What's up, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:52]** Was Kaniko in your memory of what happened aboard the Grey's ship?

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** Ah, let me think.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:59]** And he says that as he's taking aim and targeting Torv.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** They were, they were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** Okay.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** You can also attack non-lethally.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:15]** I will, but I'm not in the first round because I can't afford... I don't want to miss!

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:16]** Nope.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** I will do... Yes.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:21]** I will do full action lethal damage is what I'm going to do.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** Ooh!

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:23]** Hmm.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** And I hope I don't kill him.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:27]** But you never know.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** Okay.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** Classic murder bot move.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:33]** Taking the risk here.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:35]** Plus nine to attack.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:38]** So that's going to be a plus five for each.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:41]** I'll get to that in a second.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** The first one's a natural one.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:47 - 00:52:17]** think you uh wow i think you get a critical fumble card there rick 19 yeah the second one's an 18 though so that's a 22 to hit oh so you're 23 to hit let's go through the uh the critical yeah dude right this is the first time here we go i'm gonna do a quick little shuffleoni with my super skilled vegas training that i did yeah okay here we go ready three two one tell me when to stop in the cars and going and okay

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:17]** All right.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Top card.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:21]** Critical fumble, dude.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:23]** This is a kinetic or energy attack.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:24]** Energy.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** Energy.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:26]** Ooh.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:31]** It's called, is it hot in here or cold?

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:35]** You are exhausted for 1D4 rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:37]** What?

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** What?

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:40]** Isn't exhausted, like, the worst possible condition?

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:41]** Uh-huh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** Yeah, it's pretty bad.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** One round.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:45]** It, like, debuffs everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** Yeah.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:46]** Oh, okay.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** Well, at least it's one round.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** Good lord.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:49]** Okay.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:55]** For the first time in his life, Rick19 is tired from killing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** We never thought we'd see the day.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:01]** He's like, I don't want this to happen anymore, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** I just can't do this, guys.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** Guys, look.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** Guys, I'm just going to sit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** I'm just going to crisscross half the sauce here.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:23]** It is a minus three to armor class, attack rolls, melee rolls, thrown weapons, reflex saves, initiative checks, strike checks, dexterity checks, and the amount of bulk you can carry without becoming encumbered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:25]** It's like ridiculous.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:25]** Oh my gosh.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** Oh yeah.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:29]** That's like the worst prescription ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:31]** Right.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:31]** Okay.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:34]** So this is going to do, it's not towards my attack.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:37]** So that is, there's a 22 to hit, but that's a minus three to that.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** So we're back to 19.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** Does a 19 hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:45]** You literally said, I'm in every way, but I can still kill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:51]** I can still kill him if I wanted to.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:52]** I love it.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:52]** Yes.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:53]** 19 hits.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:56]** What damage do you deal to Torf?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** Hold on.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** I got to see.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** I think this one's a D12 maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** Okay.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:02]** Tell me.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:05]** And I think I realize what happened.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:09]** And Colin, you're going to notice some of this because you're right behind Rick.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** Do you seriously roll a d12?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** It's a d12 plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** Wow.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** I just love rolling d12s.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:20]** They're just rad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:23]** That's a 6 on the die for a total of 10 points of fire damage.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:25]** 10 points of fire damage.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** Yikes.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Okay.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:27]** Oh, wait, wait.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** I take that.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:28]** Sorry.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** 11 points of fire damage.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:30]** Okay.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** I'm fucking this all up.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** I'm looking at the wrong damn thing.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:33]** That's my battle axe.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:34]** It's a 10.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** It's a D10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** Yeah.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:38]** I was curious about how your rifle had a D12.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** I was like, that's some high-level stuff.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** You're starting to pull a Kelly here.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** Don't do that.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:43]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:44]** I know.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:44]** Okay.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** So I got my D10.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:45]** Jokes.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:46]** Jokes.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** Just kidding, buddy.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:48]** Oh, it fell on the floor.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:48 - 00:55:09]** hold on let me just let me just take a sip of my drink okay that's a four on the die for a total of nine points of damage nine points of damage okay fire it is fire damage so i'm right on that okay all right okay so it is nine points of damage as it breathes out with a sigh of just a pure exhaustion


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:16]** Yeah, I think that first shot that missed, maybe you just spent way too long.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:20]** And Colin, you're seeing him raise the rifle and you're like, when's that shot coming?

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:28]** And then suddenly fires and it hits above the bookshelf that's to the left and just leaves a scorch mark in the wall.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:31]** And then you shift and aim.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:34]** So in Colin's mind, Colin's like, that's a...

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:36]** Rick's maybe a little off his game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:38]** Rick, you stood over the ball too long.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:40]** You stand over it, you're definitely going to miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:44]** I was waiting on here's his reply for just a little longer than I expected.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** I'll answer you quick.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:50]** Don't blame this on me.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:50]** I have a question.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:52]** Meltaman is sitting in a chair there.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:55]** Can Meltaman be any use to us?

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:58]** Is it possible to hack him and make him become a combatant?

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:02]** If you would like to... I'm just going to put that up there.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:08]** And I think that's my whole turn, but I do want to note that my EAC and KAC is now lower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** EAC and KAC is lower.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:10]** Okay.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** All right.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** Yeah.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:12]** Okay.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** I see you.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** I see you.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:17]** If you want to do something like that, I don't know.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:17]** Who knows?

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** Maybe you can.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** Maybe you can't.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** So.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:32]** End of Rick 19's turn as he takes one shot from being exhausted, hits, leaves a scorch mark, and then lands a hit on Torv after Dr. O.K.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** threw a grenade.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:37]** What color is the pheromone, Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:38]** O.K.?

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:43]** I would imagine it matches the Veracinea's plumage.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:45]** Okay.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** So it would be like, wasn't it like a pink?

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:48]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:50]** It was like a fuchsia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:53]** Kind of like a pinkish-purple glow.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Like a pinkish-purple, yeah.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** We'll save colors.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:58]** Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** It's mostly a we'll save.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:00]** Cool.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:05]** So, Torv sees you.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:09]** And Torv has already been...

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:15]** And especially after you get hit, the smile just stays on his face.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:27]** And you see that Torv raises their great axe and then is going to charge you, Rick19.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** Uh-huh.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** Uh-huh, indeed.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** Torv leans.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** Oh!

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:47]** and just starts running down through the lounge and runs 25 feet towards you and is going to make a melee attack against you.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:53]** Rick19, let's see what happens.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** This is against your KAC.

**[00:57:57 - 00:58:01]** That is a... John's doing a lot of math right now.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:06]** 27 to hit against your KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** Nope, I'm good.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:07]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** Oh, sweet.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:09]** Yo, awesome, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:09]** Yeah, that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** Yeah, that's rad, dude.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:14]** And I was just saying that I don't roll D12s enough.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:18]** That's 15 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:23]** Okay, so as that axe is coming down, he's got his gun up.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** D12s, plural.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:33]** He goes to move kind of just like out of the way, and he kind of turns his other shoulder, and the axe hits him across that shoulder, and...

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:34]** Give me a perception check, everyone.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:37]** Torv, too?

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:41]** I don't know if Torv would care, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:45]** What's my perception bonus?

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:49]** 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** All right.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:52]** So Dr. Kut, okay, definitely notices it.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:58]** You actually see his, it's almost like a rash start, kind of.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:08]** It's like little speckles of black right where the axe is about to hit, and then the axe strikes, and there's three less damage that he takes from that.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:11]** So I take a total of 12 points of damage, not 15.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:13]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** Oh!


## Speaker_0

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:19]** Nicely done, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** Wow.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:20]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** What was that?

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:25]** Kevin has some, like, what is that spell that he has, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:29]** He's got some soldier swag.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** Maybe he's a warlock now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** Who knows?

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:35]** Who has Rick sold his tortured soul to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:39]** Rick's got some sword work.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:41]** I like this little version of Palpatine.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:45]** He's a very, like, mannequin type of dark side-ass kind of character.
