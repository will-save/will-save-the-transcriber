## Speaker_0

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:22]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:25]** You have come to the right place at the right time.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:29]** Welcome to we'll say the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:42]** I am your fiery GM, John Swan, and I am joined by my best buds, Vinnie Rodriguez,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:48]** We're John's best friends, so you guys aren't allowed to be his best friends.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** Stay away.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** What?

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** What?

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:53]** The willing can't creep in there.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:56]** I know Jeremy's trying, though.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:56]** He did.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:58]** He slid right into those DMs.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Jeremy is doing that.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:01]** Yeah, they're just like... Jeremy DMs me, too, okay?

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** So does Adam.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** No DMs from anyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:07]** Y'all are getting DMs?

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** I also have friends.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:08]** What?

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:09]** Man.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** I'll DM you, Will.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** Wait, Will is not getting DMs?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** All right.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:13]** Everybody in Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** I don't want any DMs, though.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** DM Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** No, it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** Get the power, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** Everyone ask how he's doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:21]** Everyone DM Will something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:23]** Will and I DM each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:23]** Yeah.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:24]** Okay.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:24]** All right.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Screw you, Vinny.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:33]** Vinny, the guy who like twice didn't respond to my texts, even though he asked me a direct question, and then I replied with my answer to your direct question.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:33]** How dare you?

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** Are you serious?

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** Pre-Scotland, you responded, and I was like, all right, cool.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** We've turned over a leaf, but my God.

**[00:02:38 - 00:03:03]** wow i feel like we've had this conversation before and i still don't remember we did that's fine we'll figure it out i was not expecting this banter to be mostly us airing our grievances last last banter was personal grievances positive remember it was like let's it was positive no it's not go around it's not a group what do you dislike about yes it can't cut too deep though come on


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:26]** this would be interesting actually let's not do that we've alienated enough states and enough people groups now we need to alienate ourselves is that it from each other you are listening and watching to the uh implosion we'll say the podcast we'll save the self-destruction you know what we start strong we finish strong that's how we do it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:31]** All right, this is my thought, and I'm just going to bring this up.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** It's open-ended.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:32]** Okay.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** I want to ask.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** We're showing thoughts today.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:35]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:40]** What horror movie are you, like, kind of into or is, like, no, I'm never going to watch it?

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:45]** Because I didn't watch The Ring for a long time, and I didn't think I'd be scared, but I was kind of like, I don't know.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** I'm just not going to watch it.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** And then I watched it last night.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:52]** And I have to say, it was actually a great movie.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** That was a good twist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** The first one, right?

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:57]** Because Ring 2 was on Showtime over the week last week.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** Ring 2 is ridiculous.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** I was like...

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:11]** I was in a hotel room all last week, and it was just like click-through showtime, and the guide wasn't working, so I didn't know what movies were on.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:15]** And so I would just Google scenes to try to figure out what the movie was.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:24]** And the scene was a little boy named, I think, Adam, and the mom named Rachel in a Jeep down a wooded highway.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** Ricky.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:31]** And there was a deer, a buck that comes out and she slams on the brakes.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** And like, that wasn't enough to get anything.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:36]** And then the deer attacked the car and I was like, buck attacks car.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** And it was like, oh, that's the ring too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:42]** Of course, that one classic scene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:50]** And then I learned that Showtime actually, you can actually Google or go to the Showtime website and they will give you the schedule that's on TV currently, which is a lot more helpful.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** Yeah, that's very helpful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:57]** I do have to say, the dialogue was my one thing because the kid...

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:21]** i guess the kid adam doesn't want to like you know like spoilers rachel doesn't show him a lot of time and attention and love bless you benny and uh and he calls his mom rachel he's like oh rachel hello and it was like and then he speaks very cryptically until of course the end when he like talks to her very frankly

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** And then he's like, you fool.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:23]** No, he doesn't.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** That's part of the... Spoiler.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** Geez, John.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:26]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** Wow.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** Did you spoil Ring of the Ring 2?

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** Because I can't remember which one was which.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:33]** I can't remember how... Oh, don't do that.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** Don't spoil the Ring 1.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** I don't know.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** Wait, have you guys seen the Ring 1 show?

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:37]** Yeah.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** It's like the Xbox One.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** It's like actually the third movie.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** It's like... It's not good.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:44]** Wasn't it originally a Japanese movie?

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:44]** It was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** Did you watch the Japanese movie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** It's called Ringu.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:48]** I did.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** I remember correctly.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:56]** I have not seen the Japanese one, but I think actually I have, but it's like, I think it's like the same thing pretty much.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:56]** Yeah.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:57]** Yeah.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:59]** Like a shot for shot remake.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** I can't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:03]** It's very 2002.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** Yeah.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:09]** But it's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:18]** Speaking of Japanese horror movies that were remade as American and very good, The Grudge is going to be mine for sure.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:24]** That movie stuck with me for so long and like

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:44]** i i did not start watching horror movies until i was a full-on adult like within the last couple of years um and so like i've i've seen it in it part two i'm making my way back through the solid movies which arguably could be thrillers and not horror but fair whatever uh but i saw the grudge as a teenager and that me up

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:51]** The idea of just moving into a home and having stupid freaking... The home hate you?

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** The home hate me?

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:59]** Having demons crawling out of the attic and down the stairs trying to kill... Nope.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:01]** The attic is legit the creepiest place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** Always.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** Yeah, for sure.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** That's why we don't have them in California.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:08]** I haven't seen... Is it the Watcher?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** I have both.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** And I live in California.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** What is The Watcher, Kev?

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:17]** I think it's called The Watcher, and it is actually a Netflix show.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:17]** I did see that.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:21]** But that's based on a true story from less than 10 years ago.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:21]** It's a good series.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:25]** But apparently, the actual story is not as...

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:45]** as creepy it was more like somebody just leaving notes in the mailbox it wasn't like somebody sneaking into their house but they sensationalized it but yeah yeah yeah the ghost stories at dunsky no man i'm telling you i can't say i signed an nda i'm not allowed to say anything else um i didn't believe that before

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:49]** The horror movies that I won't let anybody sleep on is the Scream movies.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** So Scream 1, absolute classic.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** If you haven't seen it, you need to fix yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:56]** I am in the process of getting my wife to watch it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:56]** Nice.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:57]** Okay, great.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** Scream 1, fantastic.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Scream 2, okay.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:03]** Scream 3, I never saw Scream 4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:05]** Before I heard it was really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** I never saw four.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** And from what I understand, it wasn't good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:11]** Five is the remake one.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** Maybe it was five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:18]** It's just called Scream, but it's actually Scream 5 because then Scream 6 is called Scream 6.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:31]** But the second Scream is very clearly a requel to the point that there is a character in the movie that is the equivalent to the Jamie Kennedy character in the first Scream movie.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:48]** explaining we're in a horror movie and this is this is not a sequel it's not a remake it's a requel and points all the details out and it's just like man but like that movie and the second one scream six i i i was like man i'm gonna watch the second one

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:56]** And I was actually pretty impressed by them to the point where I couldn't figure out who the killers were until the last second.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:59]** I was like, oh, dang, they got me every time.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:01]** So, yes, excellent films.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Don't sleep on those.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** Go watch them.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:04]** They're really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:09]** I guess I suppose I'll follow that up because I haven't seen Scream 1.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:15]** And then the first, well, the only convention so far that we've all been to, minus Vinny, unfortunately, because it's before Vinny.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** I remember.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:21]** was Matthew Lillard.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:24]** I had no idea who Matthew Lillard was.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:28]** In front of Matthew Lillard was like, oh, don't you know who he is?

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** Don't you know who he is?

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** We were so embarrassed.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:33]** We were all so embarrassed.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:35]** Was, like, twice.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** Because I passed by again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:39]** And I wanted to talk to him about hackers and SLC Punk.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:42]** And we were just fixated on, like, Scream.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** You didn't know I was in Scream?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** You've not seen Scream?

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:47]** How old are you?

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:47]** What the fuck is this?

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:50]** All right.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:53]** At that convention on more than one occasion about this.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:55]** But then I found out that he was in the Scooby-Doo movie.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** And then I was like, oh, okay.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:58]** I know who you are from your worst movie ever.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** That's the one he's, like, most known for.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** He seemed nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:06]** I honestly don't really watch horror movies, unfortunately.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** I don't know why.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:12]** I have seen The Ring and I have seen The Grudge, but since those were already chosen, I don't know what to say.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:15]** Those are really... Yeah, I don't watch them.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:17]** But I can kind of...

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:41]** sort of uh kevin said uh he you know because like it's a bit of a mystery uh there's like some horror mystery episodes of detective conan if you know what detective conan is it's a really cool little anime that legit has very hard to sometimes very hard to like figure out who actually was the murderer uh per episode or whatever it's a very good show check out detective conan so

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:45]** For some reason in English it's called Case Closed or something.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** Anyway, that's my answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:48]** I'm trying to think.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:53]** There was the Netflix series and there's been Haunting of Hill House.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** I love that series.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:59]** Is it a follow-up?

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** Are they related?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** No, I don't think they're related.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** I think it's a separate season.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** It's like White Lotus.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:08]** No, it's Follow the House of Usher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:32]** no fall of the house of ushers actually i really want to watch this it's it's a edgar allen poe story yeah yeah that's being made into a series and it's getting rave reviews but i need to watch that one but there is another one by the it's the same uh filmmakers and a lot of the same actors um and it's i think haunting of blight manner is i've heard of that one yeah it's supposed to be good is that related to the annabelle series at all not that i know of


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:34]** I thought it was like the house that they started in.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** I don't know why I thought that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** Yeah, I never saw that once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:37]** I wouldn't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:41]** But yeah, I just don't have enough time.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:45]** So, John, you used to you used to you told me you used to read the.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Oh, yeah, I still do.

**[00:11:48 - 00:12:12]** i started doing that mostly because i just don't have time to watch all these crappy horror movies because i don't have time to watch it and it looks interesting and i will then like google certain scenes and and be like oh so how's this scene go kind of like reading a recipe instead of eating like a dinner it seems like kind of weird


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** It's the Cliff Notes.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:15]** He's doing the Cliff Notes version.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** I'm doing the Cliff Notes.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:18]** But that's still a medium that's similar.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** It's like a movie that you're reading.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:21]** It's kind of strange to me.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** Okay, I got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** I judged him.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:27]** The first time I heard him say that, I was like, that's stupid, dude.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** Why don't you just watch the movies?

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:30]** But now I don't have the time to do it.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** So now...

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** And it saved me.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:35]** It has saved me from bad movies.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:41]** Like, no offense, but the movie with... What's his name that plays Drax?

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** John Bautista.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:46]** Yeah, Bautista.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:49]** He has a horror movie out that I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:52]** I was like, man, I was like on the verge of watching that one.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** And then I was like, I'm just going to read the synopsis.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:57]** And I'm glad I did because it's it's sounds terrible.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** And it got really terrible reviews.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** But yeah, I don't.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** Yeah.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:06]** That's tough because like on the one hand, I the experience is so different.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** Totally consuming the media that it is.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:12]** It's like the difference between and I'm sorry, because this is definitely going to hurt us.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** The explicit tech.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:17]** It's the difference between porn and sex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:25]** I think it's even worse because it's like reading the synopsis of a porn movie and not even erotic fiction.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:28]** It's just like, you know, this is what happens in Big Tits 35.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:32]** And then you're just like reading that instead of watching it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:35]** There was no sausage on the pizza when the delivery boy came.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** Yeah.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** I didn't see that coming.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:48]** Also, John, there are like, if for people like you, and I understand, because as a person with, I have a similar situation where we don't have too much time.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:50]** YouTube, they have like 10 minute breakdowns of videos.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** That's fine too.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** Of movies you could watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Happy to watch that.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:56]** I do say, I like reading like creepypasta stuff.

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:02]** Like if there's ever a social media or like a Reddit thing that's creepy, I will read the f*** out of it for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:05]** This one's definitely gonna be like flag explicit for sure.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:16]** We had three now and then that yeah Vinny said which is good and accurate but funny and Well, I gotta ask will is is there anything that you want to What's the question again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:24]** I'm sorry Is there a horror movie that you liked or that freaked you out or that you recently saw besides scream I


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:40]** um well i mean i recently uh you know this past uh halloween i i visited some uh old slasher films which i don't consider horror they're more just like gore yeah um

**[00:14:40 - 00:15:00]** i really like independent film um my wife works in independent film with a lot of filmmakers um one of the things that i really enjoyed watching recently was um barbarian which is now on hbo and i encourage anyone who has hbo to watch it and uh

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:04]** If you read the synopsis, you might like it, you might not.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** I don't know.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** I don't care.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** I'll watch it.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** But it's worth a watch.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** It's a good scary.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Not super scary.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:17]** It's not like... I don't want to spoil it or try to ruin it, but it's good.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:26]** I do have one minor beef with it, but it's not anything worth airing.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** And...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** Yeah.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:29]** Okay.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:35]** Vinny, why are you smiling so, so to borrow a Trumpism, I guess, bigly?

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** I feel like that's a real word now.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** Why are you smiling so bigly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:41]** I'm just, I'm just like, we'll just give him the synopsis.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:43]** He's, he's going to just read it anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:49]** Wait, synopsis is different from reading the full plot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** I'm not going to read the synopsis.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** I truly read the synopsis when I'm like, oh, that's right.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** There's this movie.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** I'm not going to see it.

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:01]** But if there's something that I'm going to see, I didn't read the synopsis for The Ring before I went to see it.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:01]** I'm just going to watch it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** All right.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:07]** Before we drop the topic, Adam Ellis is a comic book artist.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** Such a funny artist.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** He's hilarious.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:14]** But his horror is really good.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:21]** Yeah, he'll have like a six page comic book that you're just like my god I don't I don't even want to explore any of them.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** But like they're just they're so good.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:25]** Go look him up I hope he puts I think he's putting out a book.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:40]** I want to get it But the reason I started following the first place was back in the old days of Twitter I think it was he started putting pictures up and doing a story a thread about a haunting in his own bedroom Oh that guy

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:40]** that guy.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:44]** And at the end, it was like a baby with a caved-in head.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:50]** And it was very clearly a CGI character that he just copied and pasted onto a picture.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:53]** And I was like, man, I followed you for 60 days.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** That's cool.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:59]** His art and his storytelling style is fantastic.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Go read his stuff.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** I'm done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:09]** I was just going to say, Adam, if you're listening, you

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:12]** Yeah, no, really, you can do it simultaneously, too.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:15]** You can make a story funny and terrifying at the same time.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** And your art style is really brilliant.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** So it's very good.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** It's just overall well-written.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:24]** You should write other things, too, like movies or APs for Starfinder or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:26]** Yeah, you know, casual.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:28]** Just jump into a whole new brand and medium.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** Or, you know, just send us some plot hooks.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** We'll playtest it for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** Yeah, we'll do that.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** That's fine.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:55]** if you want to be a writer on the will save extended uh what is it called the intergalactic uh adventures of the interstellar status from the extra galactic adventure anthology i'm embarrassed for you for not knowing that i'm sorry listen to the show kelly i do i'm sorry he's new guys leave him alone yeah come on yeah classic classic


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:55]** We should play.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:58]** Before I go, there is one comic that has stayed with me.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:07]** And it's the one where the people need to find their body shape hole in the mountain.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** Just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:28]** yeah is it adam ellis or something else no just at some point read it it's very short it's very good hang on hang on did you give a horror movie sorry we always go through these questions and john never answers what's your horror movie well because i thought that was a ring uh there's two one is


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** One of the Conjuring is my favorite horror scene ever that I watched.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** It was amazing.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** And I won't say what it is.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:37]** I think it was the first one when they move in the house and the mom and the daughter are playing hide and seek.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** And she goes to one of the empty rooms.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** And it's really good.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** Is it The Others?

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:44]** No.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:47]** And then Paranormal Activity, that messed me up.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** Oh, that's such a great movie.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:50]** That messed me up, legit.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** I won't watch it.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** That was too much.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** That was too much for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** That's such a great movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:56]** And it was awesome.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** It was great.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:58]** They nailed it.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:05]** And then I do have to say, I think it was two or three, I think it was two, where they put the camera on...

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:22]** So like they actually upped the ante in the sequel because then they put the camera facing like the entryway and the stairs and then it would slowly rotate and right in the middle there was a fireplace so you couldn't see anything.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:25]** And then it would rotate and it would be the kitchen.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:31]** And there's like the tension in that fan and waiting for the camera to shift.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:33]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** That was really good.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** That's very talented.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** I like that.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:39]** That was really the beginning of a new genre of horror.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:44]** They started it with the very first movie.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:46]** I carry a lot of anxiety in general.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:50]** So read the synopsis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:50 - 00:20:00]** As John drops his mic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:00]** Jokes.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** No, it's fun.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** I do like watching them.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:05]** We should watch some horror movies together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** Well, I mean, Kevin's going to be out here soon.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:09]** Maybe we can do a Halloween movie night.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** You mean Halloween?

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** It's already mostly post-Halloween.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** Definitely not before.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:16]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** You guys don't watch horror movies leading up to Christmas?

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:21]** I watch Die Hard on repeat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:23]** It's a Christmas movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** I want to ask you guys.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** Jump into the game.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:32]** Before we get into this recap, I just want to ask... Boy, you know, it's eerie in here.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:33]** Thank you.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** Ooh, that was a good one.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** That's like a sleeper one.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** We don't...

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:56]** will doesn't drop that will will is not missing with the drops and we're only like 20 minutes in i know it's good it's true how are you all feeling as players and characters and i'm asking because you know there's one kind of mini chapter it's closing a little bit you left

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:59]** Now you're about to land at the steward's base.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:05]** And just at this moment of transition, I just want to ask, what are you thinking?

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** How are you feeling?

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:07]** This is pretty open-ended.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** Who is tapping?

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:11]** That's me, so I guess I'll go.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** Here's...

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:18]** Here's is feeling apprehensive.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:23]** I mean, no place that he's landed or ship that he's boarded has ever been safe.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:27]** So he has a feeling that it's probably not going to be what it appears when he lands.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:35]** He's also apprehensive about getting answers, but slightly excited about getting answers to the puck.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:39]** He has that in his possession still, but he did have Shay look at it.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:43]** Yeah, what the fuck, dude?

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** The stewards in here have a relationship.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** You said that.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:47]** Moving on.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:51]** Kevin, why are you so angry about this?

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:52]** Because you never told me.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:55]** Rick doesn't know about that thing.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:59]** It's not that... All right.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:02]** He's been betrayed a lot, and they basically already know.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:06]** So maybe at some point he'll let you know.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:08]** Rick, you literally go around killing everything.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:10]** It's not like... We're roommates.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:12]** I can't... Yeah, that's true.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** You're making me feel bad.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** You should feel bad.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** That's the point.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** Maybe at some point we'll figure it out together.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:21]** Our friendship will go on a new path.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Okay.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:22]** Whatever.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:25]** That's my long answer with Kevin's interruption about how he feels.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** I feel the same way.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:29]** I want to know all of the above myself as Kelly.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:33]** I'll say, I think Rick is relieved.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:38]** We're finally off of a ship for the first time in this entire game.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:41]** We're on solid ground.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:43]** We're at the Steward's base.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:46]** Solid magma.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:46]** Right.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:48]** It's an asteroid or something.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:50]** We're on liquid ground.

**[00:22:50 - 00:23:12]** but like we're we're finally on ground uh and and I think for that the fact that it's also a Stewart's base is very reassuring to him that you know he's Kevla as for Kevin Kevin is very apprehensive because I know that we're only halfway through book three on a six book AP so very meta this isn't over like this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:16]** What I'm hoping it's not is another proving ground.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:16]** Yeah.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:17]** Another what?

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:21]** Or another, sorry, I don't know if that's the right term.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:24]** It's a simulation this entire time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:29]** Well, I'm sure it's still a simulation, but probably, but it's another dungeon crawler is what I mean.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** Oh my God.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:30]** I need to prepare myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** It's going to be literally the end of book six.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:34]** They're going to be like, you finally get unplugged.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:36]** Never do that.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:46]** I'm stating that now in episode 86, but I will not tell you at the end of this whole shebang that you just wake up.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** It was all a dream.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** I'd be really pissed.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** That trope is over and done.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:52]** No more of those.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:56]** I read about it in a couple of movies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** Yeah.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** Let's all check the synopsis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:05]** Do yourself a favor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:09]** Are you going to look for the we'll save the podcast synopsis?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** I think we need to have one.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** Okay.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:15]** True.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:15]** Will.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:17]** Fem.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:17]** Thoughts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:23]** Dr. O'Keefe's nervous, apprehensive, full of anxiety.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:26]** He has been alone.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:39]** He's comfortable enough with his fellow teammates, but his mind is just racing with questions about his colleague and his home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:41]** Yeah, we haven't.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** That's...

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** It's so interesting that you were like, he's alone.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** But he's bad about Dr. Okay.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** That's yet to be known.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:49]** Yeah.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:50]** Interesting.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** Yeah.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** And then we'll do the same thing else.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:53]** Right.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** What do you want me to say?

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** Just give us the synopsis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:59]** He's enigmatic.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** The synopsis of Will's life would take a long time.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** It's already been told.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:06]** It's like a sentence long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:12]** I mean, you could probably devote your whole career to finding Will in ancient historical texts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:14]** You have to define Will first, so it's kind of hard.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:17]** That's the thing about synopsis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:20]** But if you know where to look, you can see his signature in certain texts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:22]** It depends on what type of resolution you're looking for.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** All we see right now is just a shadow of Will.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** It's just a shadow of Will.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** This is all we get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:29]** Aren't we all just shadows of our previous selves?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** Wow.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:32]** Is that how Colin feels?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:39]** I think Colin is as close to a psychotic break as you can get without breaking.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:41]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:46]** Thinking through everything he's experienced in the last, what are we at?

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** Three days?

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:47]** Four days?

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:50]** Happening across creatures he didn't believe existed.

**[00:25:52 - 00:26:06]** In a plant that he didn't know anything about, he's seen everything from radioactive trolls to giant Rivener, half Rivener, Keshti, but like sentient, which he's never seen before.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:10]** He's seen Riveners and he's seen Keshti, but he's never seen them both together.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:36]** happening across this ship that seemingly rescued them from this asteroid that no longer exists um was itself sucked into this green nebula um only to find themselves in the drifts stranded by these greys and kidnapped with his mind wiped yet again um so yeah i think he's probably a little bit angry he's a little bit frustrated like what is happening why is this happening to me

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:44]** He's also probably worried about his team back on Akiton.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:48]** How much time has passed since being kidnapped?

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:52]** Are they still doing their mission?

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:56]** His family back on Absalom, there's a lot.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** And I don't know that he's equipped to handle it all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:59 - 00:26:59]** There's a lot.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:06]** I mean, you just wake up in a pile of plants and now you have to trust these four other individuals you've been with.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:35]** and already you're being you're getting your mind with all the stuff that's going on so it's a lot to to deal with john how many days for the party at large so pre-preventing how how long have we been how long have we been playing really days wise in starfinder is it three four days five six since since we since book one yeah oh since book one since jumping on board the chimera


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** It's like four or five days, right?

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** It's probably been about two weeks.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:41]** So it's five days in this last leg, right?

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:43]** After your impressive social combat.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:43]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:49]** This is actually the most time we've kind of had pass by between episodes.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** That was the end of last episode.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:53]** Yeah.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** So that was five days.

**[00:27:55 - 00:28:02]** Then it was, it was a day, an extra day because that's when you got on board the void crier.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:04]** And then, you know, went to sleep abduction.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:12]** Then you spent, I think you took two long rests in book two, I believe.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:19]** And with all the combat and everything, I would say it was about a day to two days, probably somewhere in between.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** So let's, let's just call it two days.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:22]** Right.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Cause there's, you guys are doing a lot.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:32]** And then on the Chimera, I mean, I will say, looking back, you all moved pretty quickly through a lot of things.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:37]** There were parts of the book that I had to be like, all right, I don't know if I can fit this in.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:41]** And I don't know if you guys are going to get to some things that happened.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** Because you all moved pretty quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** Like the second cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** Yeah, it never happened.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** Yeah, you could have gone there any time.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:50]** And you were like, you know what?


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** It's fine.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** So all in all...

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** What is that?

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** 10 days?

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** Yes.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:57]** Five, six, eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** Okay.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** 10, 11 days.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** Almost two weeks.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:04]** But when you've been through so much together, your bonds can grow strong really quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:05]** Yep.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** Relationships are formed in the crucible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:10]** Good stuff.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:28]** So it's at the tail end of these five days that you all, as we discussed last time, coming out of the drift into the beautiful blue and purple of Brithida, and then the slow, fiery red black rock beginning to dominate your screen.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:29]** Bless you.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:32]** That sounded like you smashed Legos on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:36]** Yeah, I thought there was a ship crashing in the background or something.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:49]** Classic every time I see him and he sneezes he throws Legos on the floor Yeah, they're all snotty Legos, it's great love that Kelly are you a family?

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** I don't see you on Patrick.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** Oh, yeah, I cool totally.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** I'll be there.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:54]** Yeah.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:54]** No.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:59]** No you totally are I'm missing you have come to

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:20]** poured and that's a board you have come on to the death moon of eros as some called it it's primarily research some mining mostly run by prison camps do we know it's about its existence like we know it by name

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:23]** Yeah, I mean, who did a culture check last time?

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** I think so, yeah.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:27]** About that there are small facilities.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** It's an incredibly inhospitable environment.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** You come aboard.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:36]** I keep saying the word aboard because we're used to ships.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:40]** You come down over these black...

**[00:30:40 - 00:31:03]** dark hills dotted by fiery bobbit pits and as shown on foundry you the void crier pulls into the base at tiercala's base the steward's base here on veros gonna go ahead and change the music here to something happy and nice

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:09]** As you come in, there are a bunch of balloons and they're like, welcome back!

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** You did it, guys!

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** There's a band.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:19]** There will never be any problems ever again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:25]** There's people waiting for us and they put flower necklaces over us.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** Lava stones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** Welcome!

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** Aloha.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:32]** So,

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:44]** As your ship pulls in, you can see that there is another ship next to you.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:49]** This base is pretty large, and the hangar itself is very spacious.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:52]** You all, I believe, were on the bridge.

**[00:31:53 - 00:32:01]** And Shay, Narla, everyone starts to get ready to de-ship.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Let's call it de-board.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:22]** are you all rushing to get off or are you waiting like you what's the do we have any luggage i mean do you have do you have stuff no we shouldn't i mean you probably don't have too much yeah all the luggage we were hauling around behind us this entire like quest

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:46]** kevin uh and rick are like trying to pack their armor and their carryout yeah i i everyone watch out for uh here's duffel merch coming to uh coming to uh we'll save soon it's really good it's big enough to hold a suit of light armor right yeah yeah yeah four for me and vending caster


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** Level 7 one, don't forget.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:52]** It's actually a null space duffel bag.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:54]** Yeah, it fits a lot.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:56]** It fits a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** It fits a lot.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:15]** I guess, speaking of the armor, I think that's one thing that Rick is going to do, is, like, as they announce that we're coming, we're approaching Protheda, and he knows, like, oh, we've only got a few more hours before we actually land, he goes and finds Orvir's...

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** room, what is it called?

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** What's the word?

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:21]** Quarters, that's the word.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:31]** So he knocks on the door and when Ovir opens the door, he's got the armor kind of stacked up very neatly.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:59]** in a pile um like almost like per like the way you expect uh you know a military dressed piece of uh this is heavy armor right so like the way you expect heavy armor to be you know combined in a way that it's you know travel able to travel with um and he just presents that back to him and says thank you for letting me borrow this well i'm glad i kept you safe look here's this so nice yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** Oh, hey, Gears.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** Gears is right behind Rick.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** He's like, we are good people.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:09]** We return things that... His arms are folded and he's, like, nodding in approval.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** You definitely are.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:10]** Yeah.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:11]** Yeah.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** For sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** When the situation calls for it.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:36]** Rick says like I'm just very thankful that we I didn't actually have to use it in any way and I appreciate you being so lenient on the actions of me taking it from you in the way that I did I apologize well I was unconscious so was there something that happened when you took it from me


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:38]** Does he really not know everything that went down?

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:41]** I mean, like, I was talking to Rick, but yeah, do you really not?

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** You remember everything that happened, right?

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** We told you what happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** Yeah.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** I just, yeah.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:51]** No, I'm glad that you used it and you didn't have to use it.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** Yeah.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** You both are...

**[00:34:56 - 00:35:11]** true combatants maybe uh maybe one day we'll have to do a little wrestling or you know hope i don't have to be against you you know i'd be scared you know kind of gives you a wink you know i'm proud of you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:14]** That offer stands if you ever want to join the Paratons.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** Just let me know.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:16]** I'll keep that in mind.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:17]** Thank you very much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:18]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:20]** I'm not that impressed, so I'm probably not going to join.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** I'm just kind of walking away.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:23]** Yeah, not so much.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:24]** Yeah.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** Sorry.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:29]** They literally, there were four of us, and we kicked their asses.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:29]** Come on.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:31]** That can't be that great.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** They're not even professionals.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:35]** They are mercenaries and we just destroyed them.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:45]** We have like a healer, a slug scientist, admittedly a f***ing killer robot, and then like a pirate who's not as good at killing as Rick, so it doesn't make sense.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** It just means we're that good.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:48]** Alright, I'm sorry.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:51]** Peace.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** Thanks for sh**ting on our rescuers.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:54]** I didn't mean to say that in front of you, Orby.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:54]** I apologize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:58]** If you ever want to join the Pattersons, there's always a spot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** Just let me know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** Always happy to help.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:07]** I hope you're aware that you are speaking out loud and not telepathically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Yeah, I heard that whole thing.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:13]** I'm sorry, my antenna got clipped and ever since then things have been kind of hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:17]** That's what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:21]** You don't use telepathy.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:25]** Jimmy T, I know that you suggested the lisp, but I can't lisp to save my life.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:26]** I'm so sorry.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** In exchange, what I'm going to do is this.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** Jimmy T on Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:33]** I'm going to occasionally speak out loud accidentally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** Maybe I'll flip a coin or something.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:41]** I'll pull a shock and flip a coin and see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** We'll see if it's actually telepathic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:49]** We'll be at Vero soon enough and we can relax and talk more about it then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** Link, thank you.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:57]** Kind of, you know, gestures to the armor and shuts the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:01]** So we flash forward, unless there was anything else you wanted to do with that scene.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Just an embarrassing revelation.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:11]** Like, it didn't occur to me until this exact moment that Orvir Pyke is the Pyke of Pyke's Puritans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** I didn't know that either.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:15]** They're his Puritans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** You've done a lot.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** Yeah, yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** Oh my god, that's the entirety of them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** Good talk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** Well, it could be two more.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** Anyway, so...

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** He's got brothers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** Rick's a goody two-shoes.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:31]** If he's going to join anyone, it's going to be a quote-unquote goody two-shoes.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** We'll see about that.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:38]** But he says that he wants to join the stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:38]** Okay.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** So let's flash forward.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:47]** The ship has come in to the hangar at Tyrcalis Base.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:51]** And I will move you over to a map in Foundry, but I do want to know.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:54]** Are you all, like, getting off with everybody?

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:56]** You in the front, you in the back?

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:56]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:01]** Wow, out of context, that sounded terrible.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** Can you say it again, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** I'm going to say middle.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** You're in the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** Okay.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** Everyone is getting off.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** Are you telling us to take the ship?

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:13]** I'm just asking, are you at the front line?

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:15]** Are you like, yeah, I want to get off?

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:18]** Or are you like, I'm just going to hang in the back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:29]** Dr. Okay, but like they're not they're not talking but they are like walking together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:34]** Yeah, I'd say about 15 meters apart


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:41]** Rick will be in front of the group of the four, but he's going to be nearer the stewards.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:47]** I'm assuming there's a separation of stewards and baritones at this point, and we're probably all in the middle.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:57]** So I think Rick is kind of leading the way, almost piggybacking off of the stewards, but staying close to the other three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:03]** Here's will be behind Rick, but in front of the Pikes Puritans, just kind of folding his arms as he comes down the gangway or whatever.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:08]** Just kind of like, you know, chatting with them lightly as he goes down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:10]** You're chatting with the Pikes Puritans?

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** Yeah, you know, just casually.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Okay, cool.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:14]** I like it.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:17]** And Rick is... Talking about armor choices.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** I like it, yeah.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:21]** Asking people why they have certain armor.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:27]** Shay and Gnarla... Shay and Gnarla lead the way.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:47]** down the boarding ramp and out of the ship with orvier next to them you all in the middle as you said the mercenaries are around you and bringing up the rear the hangar is pristine it's clean if you can picture this it is very organized

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:51]** Storage stacks along the side and rear walls.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** Things are put away neatly, nicely.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:56]** It's large enough for two ships.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** It's a double height in space.

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:01]** Easily 40, 50 feet up.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:08]** Yours and the ship to your left, which has the same symbol that the Pice Paragens have.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:11]** So you think that this is probably their ship.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:38]** i'm gonna bring you to a map a new map can you say again so the ship we got off of was is definitely and the ship that pulled in next to us that was similar is definitely a pike's paradigm ship yeah it's similar uh if you want to see what ship model it is uh i will need a culture check if anybody has you're getting off uh here's my ships though let me see yeah go here all right let's let's take a look


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:42]** Do you have, like, a profession pirates thing or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** I don't know.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** It's a good question.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:49]** All right, so it's a 13, but I'm self-modifying it because I'm a pirate.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** So I'm going to say plus 10 to that.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** So that's a 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:53 - 00:41:02]** You would get, like, a minus 5 on the DC if you have, like, a profession.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:26]** so like dr genetics and life science dc is minus five generally got it could also give me a piloting check or engineering oh i think that's a good idea add in as well oh well then yeah i guess i'll do that for sure i'll do engineering then uh 21. yeah it's a songe of all


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:38]** It's a cool ship.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:41]** And I hit the resume browsing in my fricking browser.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** All right, I'm going to bring you over to a new map.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:47]** And I'm always nervous when I do this, because I hope I got all of your vision and everything right.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:52]** So if you see a lot, then maybe give me a shout out.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** OK.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:57]** So I've now activated the map.

**[00:41:57 - 00:42:03]** You should see the immensity of the Void Crier on top above you.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:07]** You will see the four of you in the middle of the pack

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:10]** with Gnarla, Shay, and Orvier at the front.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:20]** And you should see, if you scroll up a little bit, you can see the tip of the Pyke's Periton's ship that is sticking out from the other end of the hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:21]** Oh.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:23]** I also see three characters standing around.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Are we supposed to see them?

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:26]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:41]** As soon as you get off, you see that there is an android with teal blue hair dressed in pretty casual work clothes.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:48]** They are walking around carrying, updating.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:52]** Seems like they are walking with a purpose, not really paying too much attention to you.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:54]** There are two other figures.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** There's a human in more of a flight outfit.

**[00:42:57 - 00:43:06]** And there is a human female who is with red hair in a typical steward's blue outfit.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** They're all moving around.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:10]** You can maybe see their legs as you're getting off.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** They're all around the hangar.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** But you all can see everything, yeah?

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** Cool.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:21]** So you see that there are airlock doors that lead from the hangar.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:29]** There is a single door to the south and there is a double airlock door to the east.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:39]** The east door has on it the words restricted access that bridge the two leaves of the doors.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:46]** And as you're walking out, maybe you all have just started to walk forward.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:49]** Shay, Narla, and Orvi have stopped.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:55]** And the door, that is the restricted door, opens.

**[00:43:55 - 00:44:15]** and out walk this tall humanoid in gleaming suit of blue powered armor approaches, accompanied by a Vlaka in a steward's outfit that is impeccable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** It is so cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** As soon as the armored figure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** Do you know these people, Kelly?

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** No, I'm just so excited.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:24]** I'm so excited there's finally a dog person.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:32]** Because I remember when we played with the Emergency Power Pod and Hex Grid Heroes.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** I really wanted to be one.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** I've never seen one before.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** That's so cool.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:37]** Oh, my God.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** The armored figure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:40]** Doof.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** Doof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:47]** This huge blue power armor that looks impressive, to say the least.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:52]** You can feel the ground vibrate with every step that they take.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** Their face is long.

**[00:44:55 - 00:45:00]** They have the large black eyes, close-cropped white hair.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:06]** This is a Vrthani with a stern face.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** They walk up.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:10]** You're Lomus?

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:40]** welcome back your reports preceded you although uh the last one not by much gives a knowing look to narla kind of like i see you commander pike nods at commander pike good to see you as well and uh tries to look around

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:44]** Looks at you, makes eye contact with you, Rick.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** With you, hears.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Dr. O'Kay and Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:51]** See, you've brought some of the guests that you mentioned.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:53]** The Alamas.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:58]** Though I can't... Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:01]** Can't quite see Dr. O'Kay and Colin, but he thinks he does.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:04]** I'm Inspector Jock's herd.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** I'm the supervisor here.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** Gnarla just jumps up.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:19]** As soon as he stops and leaves a punctuation at the end of his sentence, she says, These people have been through a lot, Inspector.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:23]** Both the Peritons and the four that we rescued.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:26]** They then rescued us.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:29]** They deserve our respect.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:33]** Her just nods.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:37]** From your reports, I must agree.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:37]** Welcome.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** Welcome.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** to Tyrcalis base.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:48]** Now, you might see the door behind me.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** That's restricted access.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:55]** You might go into some of these areas there.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** That's fine.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:00]** Under chaperone.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:06]** You might be asked to for, you know, debriefing or maybe a medical exam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:09]** Actually, where is, where is the doctor?

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:16]** The Vlaka leans over and you hear like, all right, she's busy now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:20]** You might go back there with a chaperone.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:22]** You are not to be back there without a chaperone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:26]** We do like to keep things tidy and follow the rules here.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:31]** This door, however, is all yours and points to the door to the east that's right next to Orvier.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:33]** This is the guest sector.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:36]** You are more than welcome to spend your time here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:39]** I'm sure that the Paratons know it well.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:41]** I'm sure that they can show you around.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** Shay, Gnarla, we should debrief.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:47]** I'd like to get to things right away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:50]** Starts to turn and walk away.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:56]** Orvier opens the door that's next to him, the single door to the south.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** What do you all do?

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:06]** Jock's herd and the Vlaka, Shay, and Narla are starting to walk to the restricted door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:27]** uh here's here's here's stops the blocker or he like i can't move so i guess he like attempts to move towards him or her i i uh yeah i i'm positive thank you well hey hey just just one second uh i'm here's and he holds out his hand to her

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** I'm not sure if you make greetings this way.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** I want to introduce myself.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:39]** I've met many types of people, but never whatever you are.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** So I'm just a little curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** Where are you from?

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:48]** Jocks has now stopped and turned around and sees the Vlaka looking at you in conversation.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:52]** And the Vlaka doesn't answer and just walks away.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** What the ?

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** That's so rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:55]** Okay.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:56]** Rick opens fire.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** Yeah.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:01]** If ever there was a time for Rick to open fire, it's right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:05]** Show us some respect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:08]** Sean, why would you do that to me?

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Why would you do that?

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** Oh, no.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** All right.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:37]** well here's uh defeated now and he's gonna generally walk towards the open section i guess mumbling to himself okay looks like our hosts aren't really in the mood for fanfare it seems you could just say hello or nice to meet you or something maybe they don't understand i don't know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:59]** perhaps perhaps their minds occupied with other business maybe Torv or Kaniko is walking by you when or maybe one of them and they kind of they agree with you that the stewards are here some are friendly some are not

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:06]** So, I will show you where your rooms will be.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:14]** I'm pinging on the map two sets of rooms that are your rooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:25]** Orvir is like, they didn't really do a good job, but I'll talk to Shay and Narla about it, but these are going to be your rooms here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:29]** I think I'll take this top one, yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:42]** You can tell from the hallways that like the Voidcrier, the blue and gold trimmed hallways are clean, pristine, very militaristic.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:47]** Seems like there's been some modifications to the walls.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:52]** Like there's some art that is like kind of just different.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:56]** Doesn't seem like militaristic, but you know, they've been here for a while.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** It's a hostile place.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** Maybe they wanted to add something in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:03]** So, this... Some Bob Ross paintings.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:03]** Yeah.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:05]** Yeah.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** Are there some star paintings, perhaps?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Just happy little stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:10]** Yeah, just little stars and clusters.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:10]** Happy little stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** It's nice to know that Rolo made it.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:14]** Yeah, he did.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:20]** His art wasn't popular until after he passed, but... He's ahead of his time, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** Rick is going to actually...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:33]** Rick is going to ask Orvier, when he's showing us around, he's going to ask Orvier, like, is this a black site or is it a fairly known base?

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:35]** Good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** You know...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:47]** My understanding here, it's mostly for rescuing endangered civilians, right, nearby.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:57]** I've seen some times where they've had to go out and arrest some escapees from some of the preceding prisons around here.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:06]** And obviously there are times where, well, they have special missions, right, like what we were doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:10]** As usual, here's just exploring all of the rooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:16]** Yeah, here's... Yeah, guys, I got to say, we got really... He's going to try to say this in his head, actually.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:21]** So I'm going to flip a coin.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** Hold on.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** Let me... Or actually, I don't have a coin on me.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** Just roll a D100.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:24]** Yeah.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** The D-Hundo.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:46]** a d hundo uh i do that on on here again okay do you not have your dice slash roll get your die one d 100 d one d 100 it's a 96 i haven't determined okay do you do oh never mind i'm gonna roll one more what what what should be successful what did you failure no because it's already who

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:51]** I rolled a 96, but I haven't determined what succeeds or fails.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:53]** If you're going 50-50, it'd be less than 50.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:54]** It's a failure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:54 - 00:53:01]** Okay, so here's Successfully Telepathically says, I got to say, our rooms are way better.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** Theirs are galley style.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:05]** There's like 10 beds per room or something like that.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** So I think we lucked out, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:16]** Where's our rooms so or of your points points to Points to the two rooms in the center block.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** Those are going to be your rooms.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** Who is rooming with who?

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** Well, I guess I'll room with Rick again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** If you're okay with that, Rick.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:34]** I have no objections.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** I'll take the bottom bunk, I guess.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** Okay.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:41]** Call it instinctually follows Dr. Okay.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:43]** I think the men of medicine stick together.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** That makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** Are you a top or a bottom?

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** Answer carefully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:57]** I prefer to the top, but I'm not sure what... That's alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:00]** I already kind of put my stuff on the bottom bunk here.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:06]** I wasn't sure if any practical challenges with the whole slug thing might


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:09]** I don't want to slime onto you inadvertently.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:12]** Likewise.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:21]** So, you know, if something happens during the night, I don't want to make a mess on you.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** That'd be a rude awakening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** That would be.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:27]** You just wake up with, like, okay, a doctor.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:27]** No, never mind.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:39]** And there are these little blocks of rooms.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:45]** As you get to the right end of the hallway, there is another restricted access single door.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:22]** They didn't say anything to stop you from walking in there, but they criticized you for doing it.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** Typical military.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:26]** I do apologize for trespassing.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:38]** Well, I apologize.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:41]** I just never met someone that looks quite like you.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** Not to be offensive, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:47]** The gnoll looks at the elf and they share glances.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:49]** Do you know what an elf is, Kears?

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** Yeah, I know what an elf is, Rick.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** Yeah, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:55]** Unlike you, I don't kill the things that I see instantly, and I do get to know them.

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:00]** But I just never got to know whatever this person is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:25]** It's in the Starfinder Alien character deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** Got it.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:26]** Interesting.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:30]** I will do a lifetime check, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:32]** It does say cannibals in the description.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** I wouldn't have made that up.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:36]** I love a good brief Starfinder story time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** Yeah.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:45]** My bonus is... So that makes it a 28.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:57]** Yeah, I don't think you would be able to assist unless you're talking to Dr. K about it.

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:00]** Think yeah, I think definitely got it.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:16]** I mean Knowles are so Knowles are in Starfinder enhance So as a race So they are from Galarian and meta they are very much in D&D and Pathfinder Of course, they're like very classic.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:19]** They are mostly on Akiton.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:26]** So you could guess that red is from Akiton and they are not a cannibal or

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:43]** anything like that they they seem like they are a maybe a knoll who doesn't get uh get into like raiding and you know cultural yeah they have uh yeah they seem like they've gone and joined the

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:51]** Stewards so they don't seem to be like any of these other values that you would apply to them like as a race like there Yeah, they're just a different person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:55]** What was the Elf's name Sylvania Sylvia something it was close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:57]** Yeah, you were close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** She's a light bulb.

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:58]** What?

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:03]** I don't get bulbs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:12]** Oh Yeah, or it's like I mean Sylvania literally means like woods right Pennsylvania Pennsylvania she could be the forest

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** Yeah, that's what it means.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:17]** She... Penn's words is Pennsylvania.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:20]** Did you all just get here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:21]** It's red.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:22]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:29]** We're just equating ourselves with your facility here.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:32]** It's quite furnished and decorated.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:37]** I see there's a Rolu painting back there.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** Is that original?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:41]** I don't know what a Rolu painting is.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** Wait, where did you see that?

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** I might have been mistaken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:45]** Aye, Doctor.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:50]** They may call them Pahirs on the base, since typically it's the last name.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:53]** Does Pahir make more sense?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:54]** What?

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:56]** Never mind.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:56]** Never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:57 - 01:02:00]** Rolu's last name wasn't Pahir, Colin.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:02]** How do you even know about Rolu?

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** What are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:07]** I've got a deep cultural appreciation for art.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:10]** Well, you're appreciating the wrong thing.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** You're getting his name wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:14]** You all are quite a hoot to hang out with.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** You certainly keep my day going.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:18]** What do you guys do for fun around here?

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** What do we do for fun?

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:22]** Sylvania just has the best time.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** You look at Sylvania, her face is flat.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:30]** She just has the best time at playing crosswords and puzzles.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:36]** And let me tell you, I am very, very good at tic-tac-toe.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:36]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:39]** We just rolled into Brooklyn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:42]** No one's beat you on the whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** No one's beat me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:50]** I think at the beginning of this, I see why you guys kind of went down a lot on the asteroid.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:51]** You ever play pickleball?

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:52]** Wait, sorry.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:54]** Who went down on what asteroid?

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:59]** Well, you lost a couple of your mates on the asteroid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:01]** I think you're talking about the Pyke's Peritons.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** We stewards have been here.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:04]** All right.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** Yeah.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:08]** And you would know that the Pike Ferritons were the ones who lost two people.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:09]** They're the mercenaries.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:11]** They're the mercenaries, yeah.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:13]** I'm sorry I made a mistake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:13]** I mean, that's not surprising.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:17]** Do you get a lot of mercenaries coming through the base often, or what's the deal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:26]** Well, I'm not supposed to say that, you know, but if there are times where we see a lot of new faces, it's a bit of a revolving door, right, Sylvania?

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:26]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** Flat face.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:28]** Nothing.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** Doesn't say anything.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:33]** Do you guys do a lot of operations out of here, I take it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:35]** Well, you know, there are times.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:37]** Once again, just like... Sure.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:39]** Yeah, we do.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:40]** We definitely do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:42]** Yeah.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:47]** Would we know, like, how big, like, the bay is?

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:47]** Like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:50]** Like how many people are here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:58]** Yeah, or just the complement of how many ships can be here based on coming in.

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:00]** We probably saw from the bridge the size of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:04]** You saw that the hangar has two ships in it right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:05]** Right.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:06]** But is it the only hangar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** That's all that you saw.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** That's the only hangar that you saw.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** Is there the other hangar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** Is there the other hangar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:17]** From what you can see, there's no other hangar that were going to be ships.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:35]** i will say that if you want to know more about ships or the crew or the compliment or other things here you'll want to just start to talk with people and find out some more things but not something you would know on hand

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:38]** I want to call your attention to something real quick.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:40]** We did talk about this.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:47]** I did have this little thing that says 1415 in your foundry.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:52]** And I'm just using this to keep a general track of time.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:53]** Yeah, I saw that.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:55]** So 1415 is actually 215.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:58]** And it shows the sun throughout the day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:00]** It's really cool.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** I don't see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:06]** Yeah, press Shift S, and it should come up on your screen.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:18]** it's so awesome so that's just to keep track of time so I just moved ahead about half an hour just giving turns of like landing putting stuff down kind of walking forward just keeping time moving alright well look I don't like it

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:22]** Well, I do need to keep going here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** You want to play some Tic Tac too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:24]** Oh, I do.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:27]** But, you know, I'm actually going to be off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:30]** I'm actually going to be off pretty soon.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:35]** So, you know, could play a little later tonight.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:37]** Maybe after dinner if you want to.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:59]** just let me know join in yeah yeah no red does she like to spect spectate tic-tac-toe or she give advice or i mean she hasn't said anything this whole time yeah well you know she's kind of quiet you know but she does tell really good jokes you look at her nothing the whole time completely blank expression red's optimism is amazing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:03]** Hey, Red, I'm looking for some armor.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:05]** I need something better than what I have currently.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:07]** Do you have a stockpile of armor?

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:09]** I'd be happy to throw you some credits in exchange.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:14]** Didn't know if you had some stewards-issued armor that I could pick up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:16]** I mean, we're not really a place that just hands out armor.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]** We're not a store.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:25]** Well, we have sort of fought with each other on the... I don't know if you know what we went through with your friends, but there's a lot we went through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:26]** No, I don't.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:28]** Tell me later over tic-tac-toe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:30]** I definitely will, as long as there's perhaps armor involved.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:33]** So let's talk about it a little later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** Okay, yeah.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:36]** That sounds good.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:36]** Okay.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** All right, well, I'm going to go back in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:46]** Rick speaks up randomly and kind of awkwardly and says, is there any place that I can access an Infosphere terminal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:53]** In your room, you should have a place where you can access.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** There should be a computer in there.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:58]** You could also try and use the guest office if nobody's working in there.

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:04]** As far as Infosphere, we are a military base, so we do have to keep things pretty tight around here.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:08]** I don't know how much you'll get, but you can try.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:09]** I'm not sure what you're looking for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:12]** You mentioned this is a military installation.

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:14]** What's the purpose of this base?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:18]** And he says pretty much the same thing that, didn't you ask Orvir this?

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:23]** You know, it seems like they pretty much, or did you ask Red this?

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:25]** And I'm just remembering from the conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:28]** I asked Orvir if it was a black site or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:35]** You said it was for rescues and sometimes for hunting down prisoners from nearby prisons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:36]** Yeah, and that they do missions.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:36]** Yeah.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:39]** I'm not really supposed to talk about anything like that.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:41]** But, I mean, we are a Stewards base.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:43]** We do the things that most Stewards base do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:45]** Red sounds a lot like Morty from Rick and Morty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:51]** Sylvania, you seem like a pretty independent person.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:53]** Would you say that you're elf-taught?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:59]** All right, actually, that was pretty funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:21]** And then you watch and there's a little like there's like a small smirk that just yeah Quickly goes away.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:22]** Yeah.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:24]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** Well, I'm gonna get back to work now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:26]** Walks in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:27]** All right, bye.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:28]** Shuts the door.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:29]** Bye.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:30]** That's kind of weird.

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:30]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:39]** Well, that was not awkward at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:45]** So what do you all want to do right now at this moment?

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:45]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:49]** And it's 1,500 hours almost?

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:50]** Yeah.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:51]** Do we know what time dinner is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:54]** They haven't said yet, but there's going to be a...

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:57]** It's probably going to be around 5, 6, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:57 - 01:09:00]** It's probably every night at 1700.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:00]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:03]** Yeah.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:10]** Here's who wants to ask about the puck with someone knowledgeable in the stewards.

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:19]** So if there's some resource for that, and then he wants to pick up some armor, if you could direct him in the proper direction, he would be grateful.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:21]** If not, he'll try to find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:23]** Wait, so you want to talk to somebody about the puck

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:24]** And about the armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:24]** Yeah.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:26]** Yeah.

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:26]** Okay.

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:29]** Someone trusted a high up person about the bug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:30]** Okay.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:35]** You, I mean, you walk over to Sylvania and try and get through.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:37]** She doesn't let you through.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:42]** Do you try and message Narla or Shay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:46]** Here's we'll message Shay and be like, hey, any updates on the bug?

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:48]** No response.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:50]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:52]** Hey, any updates on armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:54 - 01:10:00]** You see red as well, CC.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:01]** Yeah, okay.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:02]** Red like undelivered?

**[01:10:03 - 01:10:04]** No, red like seen.

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:05]** Yeah, left on red.

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:06]** Got it.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:07]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:10:07 - 01:10:08]** Doesn't respond.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:11]** Gnarla doesn't respond either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:13]** Well, they're probably busy.

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:17]** Colin goes back to his bunk, which I think was the bottom...

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:37]** room top bunk and top bunk um he tries to make no mistake he tries to access the infosphere from his room to figure out like what what's what's happening with his you know original humanitarian task like are people looking for him what's what's the deal back on akaton okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:42]** So, hey, what's going on with Akaton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:45]** What is the deal with Akaton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:48]** What are Dr. K and Rick19 doing?

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:51]** So here's Rick trying to text.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:52]** It's similar.

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:56]** Rick goes back to his room, sits down at the terminal.

**[01:10:56 - 01:11:09]** And he's going to log on, and very similar to what Colin is doing, but first he kind of accesses a special Jira and tunnels in to the... Jira?

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:11]** Why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:15]** Because he's tunneling in to get to his... He's got some outstanding tickets he's got to check off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:16]** Yeah, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:32]** for real you guys have like a like you're part of like some larger abolition right it's a confluence page right okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:34]** No, he's kind of checking his message traffic.

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:38]** It's definitely not like a public voice.

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:49]** So he goes into a tunneled website kind of and tries to access to see if there's any other messages from them.

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:58]** And while he's at that, he gets this weird urge to search for what's the latest on Akiton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:00]** And what is Dr. Okay doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:11]** Dr. O'Kay is going to kind of check out some of the facilities around the public areas of the base that he has access to.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:18]** And he's going to be looking for any signs that Boushtakis was around.

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:23]** Was, like, physically there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:23]** Yeah.

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:29]** As you are starting to... With Bernice, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:33]** Wait, can I ask, was Budakus saved by the Peritons?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:34]** We don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:36]** Okay.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:40]** I'm just curious why you jumped to physical instead of trying to find them digitally first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:41 - 01:13:04]** yeah i'm sure you have don't necessarily not not going to do that but i think like not being i i think what he's looking to do is to establish whether or not this place is another trap he's very apprehensive about it um yeah so he's trying to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:27]** gather any sort of passive information you can based on where they are okay just from looking around the rooms okay let's dig into that in a minute and what y'all are doing in a minute because i think as rick and hears and colin are in their rooms and maybe dr okay you're like walking in that direction then as you're walking


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:29]** down, there is a voice.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:35]** This is the same tone you get every time it's about to pop off when we're doing normal stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:38]** Can I at least get armor before this happens, John?

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:39]** That's all I'm asking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:42]** This is how you get your armor.

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:45]** You gotta kill someone and take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:46]** I'm glad that I have a tone of voice.

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:49]** Dr.

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:54]** O.K., you are about to walk around the corner, and then you hear... Oh, hello!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:13:55 - 01:13:56]** Oh, excuse me.

**[01:13:57 - 01:13:57]** Are you...

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:00]** Dr. Ocatus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:07]** And you turn around and you see this small human woman with a red eye.

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:10]** That's quite the eye.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:14]** With gray hair coming down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:18]** Oh, it is just so delightful to meet you.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:20]** I have heard so much.

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:23]** And then, must this be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:24]** And she walks and peeks around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:27]** Is this Rick19?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:29]** What have you heard, Prayto?

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:32]** Can I ask who you are?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:34]** Yeah, freaking Ron, this does not sound good.

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:37]** Oh, I'm so sorry.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:40]** Please do not be alarmed in the slightest.

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:45]** I am Dr. Rel Nodens, and it's so good to meet you.

**[01:14:45 - 01:14:47]** I've heard a lot about you.

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:49]** Thank you for everything that you've done.

**[01:14:49 - 01:14:51]** Is Colin here?

**[01:14:51 - 01:14:51]** She walks down.

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:53]** Oh, Colin, hello.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:55]** How are you?

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:56]** Ron, Colin, Ron.

**[01:14:56 - 01:15:01]** You all must be just, you must be so exhausted.

**[01:15:02 - 01:15:03]** Please, rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:06]** I'm sorry.

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:08]** Colin's eyebrows are at his hairline.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:09]** What is going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:13]** Yes, sir, I didn't think I quite caught your name completely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:18]** Dr. Rel Nodens, R-E-L.

**[01:15:18 - 01:15:20]** That's my full name, but I just, I go by Rel.

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:21]** It's just easy.


## Speaker_0

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:22]** Ugh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:29]** What kind of doctor... Are you a medical doctor or another type?

**[01:15:30 - 01:15:31]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:34]** Well, you might know how some of these things go.

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:42]** You start off being a medical doctor, and then the stewards offer a good position, and you take the money, and you just...

**[01:15:42 - 01:15:45]** You know, you go wherever they want you to go.

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:47]** Anyway, I'm getting beside myself.

**[01:15:47 - 01:15:50]** I don't mean to take up too much of your time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:53]** Well, I mean, your role sounds fascinating.

**[01:15:54 - 01:15:56]** Could you tell me more about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:15:57 - 01:16:00]** I am actually more than happy to share a lot about it.

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:03]** I want to hear more about your role and your research.

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:05]** We will have plenty of time for that.

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:06]** Plenty of it.

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:13]** your medical exam, and we'll be having a quick chat, a little debriefing to go over everything.

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:15]** We'll do that tomorrow.

**[01:16:16 - 01:16:17]** Not today.

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:19]** Don't worry at all.

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:20]** It's going to be easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:25]** And that's our game.

**[01:16:26 - 01:16:29]** Alright, as far as NPCs go, she looks sus at least.

**[01:16:30 - 01:16:31]** That's all I'll say.

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:31]** She stinks.

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:34]** She sounds a little sus too.

**[01:16:34 - 01:16:35]** But she could just be really eccentric.

**[01:16:35 - 01:16:39]** Of like, should not be trusted.

**[01:16:39 - 01:16:44]** Yeah, I don't trust this Cruella de Vil looking... Look at her smile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:45]** It does look like Cruella de Vil.

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:47]** She has a red glowing eye.

**[01:16:47 - 01:16:48]** What the f***?

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:49]** John's very thoughtful as GM.

**[01:16:50 - 01:16:50]** Like, remember that.

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:56]** So then, like, if she looks like that... It's not by accident, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:16:56 - 01:16:57]** This is the thing, though.

**[01:16:57 - 01:17:01]** How do we as players not impart that onto our characters before they know it?

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:02]** True that.

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:02]** True that.
