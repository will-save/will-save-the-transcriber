## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Last time on Will Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:04]** Space Lice.

**[00:00:05 - 00:00:11]** Escaping their cubicle captivity on board the Chimera, Space Lice are threatening the health and safety of the passengers.

**[00:00:12 - 00:00:18]** Thanks to some swift action by our inadvertent companions, the fight was contained to the cafeteria.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:28]** Hears, Nico, and Rick19 set about exterminating the last problem, while Dr. OK sets about drawing the attention of a crew member in the kitchen.

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:40]** As the battle drags on, RIC-19 struggles with its optical targeting systems due to repeated misses, and in the process comes under mortal danger from a stubborn space louse.

**[00:00:41 - 00:00:44]** Will the crew be able to put down this sudden threat?

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:51]** Find out this time on Wilt's Save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:47]** There are many important things that we as individuals come around, like huddling around a cultural fire.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:52]** And something came up as we're talking right before we started recording.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:59]** And I just think it's important that we all huddle around this fire.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:07]** Oh my gosh.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:07]** Troll.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** I'm just saying it's important.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:13]** I mean, we talked about the Wilhelm scream, and so we had to lead with it.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** It's an important thing that we all know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** It's good.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** I didn't know that guy's name was Wilhelm.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** I don't know why it's called the Wilhelm scream.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** I don't know why it's called that either.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:26]** Also, quick thing, thanks to Syrinscape for that Wilhelm scream.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:30]** Only you can provide such a crystal clear Wilhelm scream.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** That's going to be their new slogan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:34]** Apparently it's used in over 400 films.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Yeah.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:36]** Wow.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** As far back as 1951.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:37]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Who is the individual who did it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** That's what I want to know.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** And like, where's the original recording?

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:45]** I don't know.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** Wikipedia doesn't have that info.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** This predates Wikipedia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:50 - 00:03:07]** Private... I guess... No, it's from the movie Distant Drums in a scene from the film where soldiers are wading through a swamp in the Everglades and one of them, Private Wilhelm, is bitten and dragged underwater by an alligator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** So that's where the name comes from?

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** That's where the name comes from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Is this Crocodile Dundee?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** But...

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** Yeah.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:15]** Thank you, Wikipedia.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:20]** Although a citation is needed, so really, it could be anything.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** Could be anybody.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** They're pretty quick, though.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:37]** When you post something, if it's blatantly false, then they're pretty quick to just kind of, like... Yeah, but there's, like, there's no... There's nobody to, like, refute it, because there's no... Yeah.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** Probably no info on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:43]** Do you remember a time... Do you guys remember a time growing up in elementary school where...

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:47]** People would say, oh yeah, you can't use Wikipedia as a source for your papers.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:50]** You still can't use Wikipedia as a source.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** It's not appropriate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:58]** But the thing with Wikipedia now is that you follow the footnotes and you find the actual source.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:01]** That's how all information should be handled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:04]** Wikipedia is a very good resource for writing your papers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:09]** It's good to source your resources from Wikipedia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:26]** I like to think of Will Save as becoming this umbrella podcast for not just Starfinder and TTRPGs, but also things that we've talked about on our pregame chat, like information literacy and movies that you should know.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:26]** Right?

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:27]** So this is good.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:31]** We're just adding this to our trove of things that we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** You should appreciate the Wilhelm scream.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** Yeah.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** So have we explained the Wilhelm scream?

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** We've talked about it.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** We've talked about the name.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:48]** So just for people who don't understand, the Wilhelm scream is that sharp scream you hear, but it's used in all sorts of films.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:51]** For example, Will just talked about Willow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:53]** Yeah.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** How many times did you hear it?

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:56]** I think I heard it like 15 times.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** Like...

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:19]** unedited unadulterated yeah just use the same screen if a dude dies and there's like a two-headed hydra like attacking him it's probably the wilhelm scream that he's uttering uh or falling off of a tower you know that happens it's just a sound bite that's been used sound bites gets used all over the place it's iconic


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:21]** It's in Star Wars a ton, yeah.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** That's probably one of the most iconic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** Oh, yeah, that's true.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** You're super right about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:28]** But it's funny because in Star Wars, it's probably used as a joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:35]** I think it's literally like an audio engineer joke to use it.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:38]** I mean, at this point, it has to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:40]** They even used it in video games.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:43]** I recall them using it in the N64 Shadows of the Empire.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:47]** Now that is a throwback.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:47]** Wow.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:51]** Give me my old-fashioned 80s Pepsi, even though N64 wasn't out in the 80s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:53]** So now we can talk about football.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** Yeah, so now we can talk about football.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:58]** I am a Packers fan, and the Packers lost today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:01]** And let's just preface the fact that we're recording on a Sunday.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:06]** Typically, we record on a Saturday, and it's smooth sailing.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Spirits are high.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** Morale, just strong.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:14]** And today, we all got on the call, and Kev especially, just salty.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:14]** Ha ha ha!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:20]** Will asked me earlier why I am a Packers fan, because I grew up, I was born and raised in California.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:23]** I've actually only been to Wisconsin, I think, once in my life.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** I've never been to Green Bay.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:29]** The reason I am a Packers fan is video games.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:37]** I've been a video game nerd my entire life, and for Christmas one year, I got Quarterback Club 98.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:42]** And Brett Favre was on the cover of that game.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:48]** So the only team I ever played on that game, because I wasn't a fan of football at the time, was the Packers.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:57]** So I played the Packers through that game, and then every time since, any time the Packers came up, I started paying attention, and I grew into being a fan.

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:00]** And now I'm a pretty diehard fan for the Packers.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** I will never leave them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** Currently wearing a Packers shirt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** I am currently wearing a Packers shirt, for those who can't see.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** Everybody listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:19]** And it's fine because Nick and I, Nick less so, but me, I've just hitched my post to a failing wagon called the Jacksonville Jaguars, being from Jacksonville myself.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:21]** Yeah, thanks, Kelly.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** That's the Wilhelm roar.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:24]** The Wilhelm growl.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** Yeah, we had the same thought.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:29]** If the Wilhelm scream was an NFL team.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** It would be that soundbite.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** Oh my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:33]** Yeah.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** That's low.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** That's pretty low.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:42]** I'm not even trying to combat that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** The Washington Wilhelms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** That could be it.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** That's it.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:46]** That's it.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** They are, yeah.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:48]** Redskins?

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:56]** So Kev has a particularly cool set of dice that he just got.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** We're going to plug real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** I'll show this to everybody.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** You guys can't see it at home.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:01]** Including the people on the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** But they can see it too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:10]** They are the base model Starfinder dice from Q Workshop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:14]** And QWorkshop makes dice, but they also make other accessories.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:18]** I also got this fancy, and you guys can see it on our Twitter.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** What is our Twitter handle?

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:20]** I forget now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** We'll save podcast.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** We'll save podcast.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:26]** Yeah, no.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** We'll save podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** What are A, N, and the called again?

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** There's like the name for that part of speech.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** Text in if you're listening and you know.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:40]** Kev, go ahead.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:40]** Sorry.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** You lost me.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** No, it's a thing.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** All right, cool.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** I lost the whole audience.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** Is it an indicative pronoun maybe?

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:46]** I don't know.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:47]** No.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** Kev, keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:49]** Sorry.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:54]** So this is the Q Workshop Dice Tower that I got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** Just super sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:59]** The tech dice tower, you can get it colored and uncolored.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:01]** I'm going to brag all about it because I think it's really cool.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:06]** It comes flat and flat like cardboard pieces that are laser cut.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** And so you actually put it together yourself.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** And it came with a cool plastic.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** It looks really cool.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:16]** It is a super cool dice tower and it kind of closes up so you can hold your dice in it.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** So I have that.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** What did the Starfinder dice look like?

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:20]** Yeah, wait.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:24]** No, but, like, explain with words for our audio-only format.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:27]** So this is the basic Starfinder plane model.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:33]** They are black with blue writing, and then they have cool, like, tech design around the numbers.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:41]** And then for the high number, like the 20 or the 6 or whatever dice you have, it is the Starfinder symbol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** That's pretty sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:47]** They are really cool, and I think the colors go really well with, like, the tech theme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:48]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** That's all I got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** That's all I got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:59]** But if you follow us on Twitter, you can see I've posted some videos as the Will Save.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** You can see those dice and that tower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:06]** Also on Instagram or wherever you consume social media.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:12]** Thanks for following us on all those platforms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:12]** Yeah.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:14]** So...

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:30]** Let's just jump in real quick, because last week we just ended at this climactic moment from Niko blowing this asteroid louse to bits.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:34]** Just totally.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** That gets kept every time.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:38]** I'm going to try not to overuse that, but that gets kept every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:40]** I don't think you can overuse it.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:40]** You can't.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** You can't.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:46]** If it's been used since the 1950s and it's still going strong today, you can't overuse it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:55]** I'm picturing this like three foot long asteroid louse screaming like that when it dies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** They're called articles.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:57]** Articles.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** Articles.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:00]** A and the.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** Is it an indefinite article?

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Indefinite article.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:03]** Indefinite article.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** That's it.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** That's it.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:05]** Cool.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:08]** We just peaked like three people's curiosity.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:09]** And then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:11]** All you lit majors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** All you English lit majors.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:17]** Well, we have talked about being interdisciplinary group.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** It's true.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:25]** We have two musicians, we have two computer science individuals, we have two mechanical engineers.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:28]** Those overlap in different ways.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:31]** But we don't have any English majors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:34]** I am a classically trained in the liberal arts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:36]** Yeah, what was your liberal arts degree?

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:37]** Theology.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:38]** No, that's right.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:40]** No, that's a separate degree that Will has.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:43]** Oh, Ancient Near Eastern Languages.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** That's super dope.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** Yeah, that's pretty cool.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:56]** You also have a theology degree or you just... I have a liberal arts degree, a BS in liberal arts with a minor in Ancient Near Eastern Languages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:58]** But I thought you also studied theology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:58]** I did, yeah.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** It's like a second minor.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** It's like a secondary minor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** That's pretty cool.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:06]** So just to brag, we are well-educated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:07]** Yeah.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:14]** But at a liberal arts, a true liberal arts college like Harvard calls everything concentrations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Well, no one here went to Harvard.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** So, you know, screw all that.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:20]** It's fine.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:29]** So I probably made a bad false start there, just to use a little football there for you, Kev.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:36]** A bad false start in that I tried to be seriously recapped the last episode, and then I used a Wilhelm scream.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** And then we just started down a whole line.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:40]** So let's try it again.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:40]** Nico.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** 15 yards.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** Should we just edit this whole section out?

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:44]** No.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** Now we're keeping this part in because this is gold.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** Except for what I just said.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** Except for what I just said?

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** Yeah, except for, wait, but what I just, okay.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:58]** So, Nico, probably two shots, not three, blows up this asteroid louse.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:03]** And then we are still in the middle of dire straits.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:07]** Rick19 has an asteroid louse attached to him.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:12]** There's an asteroid louse attached to the professor, Broden Benjamin.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:15]** Nico sharpshooting.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:17]** Here's Magic Miscellan.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:22]** And I believe Dr. OK leaving.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** Right.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:25]** Yeah.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** That kind of sums it up in a word.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:27]** Right.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:28]** Left.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:33]** Abandoned is another word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:38]** I'm pretty sure I said I would be betrayed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:38]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:41]** Here's took that really offensively.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** Here's is not okay with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:46]** Here's, I think, threatened to shove him out an airlock or something.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:54]** Because after he left, like, you know, I don't know what it was, like two rounds later, he's like, how do I, can I drink this whiskey?

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** Use my turn to drink this whiskey?

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** At that point.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:58]** What?

**[00:13:59 - 00:13:59]** I was like, you know what?

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** This never happened.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:00]** Yeah, I remember.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:01]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** Never happened.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** Why don't we let...

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:27]** the slug himself speak it is thank you still round two and you know whose turn it is dr okays so let's just jump right in we're back in the combat you guys are on the chimera in the cafeteria these asteroid lights have gone out of their magical cube dr okay what are you doing in the hallway


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:30]** Well, I can't see the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** Oh, that's good.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Thank you, Roll20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** The hallway that you went out into.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** That we can't see.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** Thank you, Roll20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:42]** I already thanked them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:46]** Oh, thanks, Roll20, again.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:49]** No thanks to you, Roll20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:52]** That would be so funny.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** Irony, thanks, Roll20.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** Thank you, Roll20.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:00]** We love you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:04]** I mean, Roll20 is phenomenal.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** It's pretty awesome, I'll be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** Oh, I like it, yeah.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** It's good.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:10]** So, Dr.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** O.K., what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** Get your tetanus boosters.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** Get your flu shot.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:42]** Yeah.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:46]** I'm going to use a basic booster.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:46]** Okay.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:50]** And I'm going to increase my movement by 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:54]** That is freaking cool.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:55]** All right.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:55]** Boom.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** So, boom.

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:00]** So you inject yourself with this booster.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** Yes, I feel much better now.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** You feel like you can...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:12]** I feel like I could run all the way into the other... So, question.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:17]** I can stagger my movement, do a free action, then continue my movement, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:18]** I don't know.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** What's the book say?

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** That is a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** What does the book say?

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** I mean, it's just a free action.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** I'm just going to say something.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** I'm not going to do anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:35]** Okay, so I should have enough movement to go into the kitchen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:47]** And, excuse me, Anton, if you are not serving asteroid lice on this ship...

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:53]** I suggest you would help us eliminate these folk before they ruin your dinner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:56]** And then peace out.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** What?

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:58]** That's what you hear.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Action.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** Okay.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:07]** And then with my swift action, I'm going to make an inky.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** Another inky?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Is that what you call it?

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** That's what we're calling it from now on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** Okay.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** All right.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** So you make another inky.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:21]** Explain what an inky is.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** I'm going to slime the floor.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** Okay.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:27]** So can you explain for people listening where you went?

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:29]** I'm going to wet myself.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:33]** Where did you go on the map that they're not looking at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:37]** So on our map there, I disabled...

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:42]** In our previous engagement, the doors, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:48]** Very simple spoof in order to make sure the doors don't open.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:52]** You can still pry them open, but they don't automatically go open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** Okay.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:53]** Yeah.

**[00:17:54 - 00:18:02]** And I am on the north side of the galley, I suppose, what you would call it.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** Yeah, it's called the galley.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:06]** Behind a table.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** near the kitchen.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:09]** So I went up the hallway, back through the kitchen.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:11]** Went north, yeah.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:16]** Yeah, that I spoke to Anton, the Android chef with an attitude.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:18]** I'm going to correct you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** It's Song.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** Song, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** I thought it was Anton for some reason.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** I don't know why.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** Song, the

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:29]** Android Chefs with an attitude, and I hope I just shamed him into helping us.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:30]** Shame them.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:31]** Just say them.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:31]** Them.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:32]** Them?

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:34]** Oh, right, right, right, right.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** Oh, okay.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** My mistake.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** Forgot about that.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:40]** Shamed them into helping us.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:41]** Sure.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:41]** Yeah.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** No worries.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:42]** Okay.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:45]** So Dr. Okay comes in.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:47]** You're effectively blocking in.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:52]** You're cutting off the roots of escape of this asteroid Laos that was following you.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** Correct.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:53]** Yeah.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:54]** That's the idea.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:55]** Yes.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** That is the idea.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:01]** Difficult terrain to move through that square.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:05]** Okay, good move, Dr. O.K.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:08]** It is Keeve Kaden's turn.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** They look over.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:17]** They have recovered from the flash of the cube exploding at this point.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:18]** They look over.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:24]** Dr. Benjam has a louse crawling up his leg.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:31]** And it has already started to dig its pincers into his leg and cause him damage.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:45]** So Keeve is going to get up, walk over to Professor Benjam and is going to make a strength check to pull the asteroid Laos off of Dr. Benjam.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:51]** Oh, that is a failure.

**[00:19:51 - 00:20:08]** So you see Keeve take their hands, put them on the asteroid Laos, and one of the pincers kind of starts to move, and they take a step back, and they seem unable to get a good hold without possibly damaging Keeve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:37]** themselves rick what are you doing so rick has this giant louse attached to its leg um he's first going to put put the like barrel of the gun to the forehead of the louse you've already dealt the louse three points of damage i think last episode yep uh but he's also got um he's got this giant artillery that's true this huge gun this like exterminator gun to take out the bug

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:43]** And so he's going to just stick it to the forehead of the louse and try to push the louse back.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** So I'm going to do a strength check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:47]** Oh, so he's going to strength check with the gun, like push it off?

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** Okay, nice.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:51]** I don't think I'd get a bonus for using the gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:51]** I don't think so.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:52]** No, no, no.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** It's fine.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:56]** I'll say that you can use it effectively the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:57]** All right.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:00]** My d20, I got a 16 plus 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:04]** Yeah, you just put the barrel square in the eyes of the bug.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** and shove the bug off.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:15]** The bug flies, skitters towards the back end of mechanically, let's say, that square, and its pincers leave little marks in the floor.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:21]** And then he's going to just follow that with his rifle and shoot it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:26]** So what is your shot on your new dice roller?

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:30]** A four plus five is nine.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:30]** Nine.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:33]** No, you shoot and you just miss.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:39]** Maybe you like misjudge where you thought the bug was going to be and it just slides right past and hits the floor.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:42]** Doesn't hit anything.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** The bug.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** Rude.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** All right.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** Here's.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:46]** What are you doing?

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** It's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:55]** Here's is going to attack the bug on Professor Benjamin.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:55]** Okay.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** He's going to do the tried and true magic missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** Tried and true.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** Already done once.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** Going to do twice.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** Old M.M.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:04]** 2M.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** It's like the company before 3M.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** So that's also a factor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:11]** Magic missed me once.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** Shame on you.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** Magic missed me twice.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:15]** Shame on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:17]** Also shame on you.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:19]** Yeah.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:29]** Kelly, you know, this week I was reading, I think if you use magic missiles of full action as like a full attack, you can actually shoot three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** Yes.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** So if you don't do anything else.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** Yes, you can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Magic missile me thrice.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:40]** You're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:42]** So that's 3D4.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** That's very funny.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** So 1d4 plus 1 three times, right?

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** Or 3d4 plus 3.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** Yeah.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** Here we go.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** Okay.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:51]** All right.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:53]** Give it to me.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:54]** It's 5.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** It's a pretty low roll, but it's 5.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** We'll see how that goes.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** Wait.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** So, wait.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** Sorry.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:03]** Oh, wait.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** No.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** That's not mathematically possible.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** No, no, no.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:06]** You're right.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:07]** My bad.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** It's a 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:35]** seven yeah i'm curious about this math now i want to see it already yeah wait wait i'm curious but i do just want to say uh the thing had one plus one plus two uh yeah that is seven it's seven it's one and a one and a two you got the almost the lowest roll but the good thing is that that asteroid louse had seven hp left oh

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** Yeah.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Nice.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:42]** As it dies, you can see that its remains start to smoke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:48]** Please keep your distance from these loaves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:55]** And it's still connected to Dr. Benjamin because they don't necessarily fall off.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** They dig in so deeply.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** Good call, Hears.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** That was impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** Nice work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** Nice work.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:05]** All right.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** It is.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:18]** The asteroid louse, who is boxed in, trying to get to presumably... With the encumbered condition.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:21]** With the encumbered condition for six rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** Thanks to Senor Inky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** It's not the ink that gave it the encumbered condition.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** It was the inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:31]** It was the pharmacological inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:34]** I gave him a nice shot of drugs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** Nice sort of drugs.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:36]** All right.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** So it begins to move.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** Five.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:43]** Then it has ten less feet because of the encumbered.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** So five, ten.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:46]** Then it steps into this square.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:49]** It can't move out of that square because that's the end of its movement.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:54]** So it just steps into this ichor, this slime from Dr.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:54]** O.K.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** 's body, which is crazy.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** I love it.

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:00]** What a great characteristic there.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:03]** So it is...

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** Professor Benjam's turn.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:16]** Professor Benjam looks up, sees that the louse is dead, looks over, having seen these magic missiles hit hears.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:19]** Or sorry, hit the lights, not hit Hears.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** Come from Hears.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:26]** And with his eyes wide, just looks, kind of nods at Hears.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:29]** And is like, thank you.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:32]** And just seems like half shocked, half surprised, half ready for action.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:38]** And suddenly he just takes his hands and tries to push the asteroid louse off of him.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:42]** And he does with a twang.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:45]** 12, DC 11 to push it off.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:50]** The strength check as the louse falls onto the ground.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:53]** Good call, Professor Benjamin.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:56]** It is top of the round.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** The third.

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:03]** It is the asteroid louse in front of our good buddy, Rick 19.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** And you know what it's going to try and do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** Nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** It's going to go home and weep.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** Go home and consider their bad actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** I want to go home and rethink your life.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:19]** Reflect on your life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** Reflect on your life.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** What is your KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:27]** My KAC is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:28]** 15.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** 15.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** Okay.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** It definitely doesn't.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** It scuttles up.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** You see its pincers try and come for your legs.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** They don't work.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** I actually, yeah.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** Okay, cool.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:39]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** You actually what?

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:41]** Tell us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:42]** Nope.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** Wrong time.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:45]** Nico, it is your turn.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** Oh, perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:55]** Nico's going to take a full action, and he's just going to shoot the crap out of the lice, space lice that's in front of Rick19.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** The louse?

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:56]** Nice.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Okay.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:57]** All right.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:04]** So I'm just going to do full attack, and he's just going to, yeah, full attack with both.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:10]** So instead of a minus three penalty, I believe he only gets a minus two penalty.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** Okay.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:11]** Right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:14]** I'm double checking that.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:18]** Instead of a minus four, you only get a minus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:21]** But I get a plus three to hit, so it washes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** Washes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** Yeah, wash out.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:25]** Wash out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** Give me those attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:32]** That's an 18 on the first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:35]** That, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** And a 16 on the second.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:38]** Both hit.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Nicely done.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:42]** So rolling for damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:45]** Rolling for damage here with what weapon you using again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:49]** Two azimuth laser pistols.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:51]** Azimuth laser pistols.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** Three on the first one.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:53]** Uh-huh.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:58]** And two on the second one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:59 - 00:27:59]** Okay.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:02]** Why are we all doing western accents or southern accents?

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** I'm not sure what accents these are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:06]** This town ain't big enough for the two of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:10]** So as this bug runs across the galley floor...

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:17]** Part of the reason why it doesn't grab onto Kev, it swings its pincers forward to try and grab Rick's foot.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:24]** And it just gets hit by two laser bolts, knocking it off a little bit and tries to grab your foot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** Missed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** Nice.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** Tarnation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:30]** What tarnation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:34]** What tarnation do you think you're doing there, Private?

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:42]** At that point, song, the door opens behind Dr. OK, and you hear, what in tarnation is going on in my galley right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** Is that – that's not how he talks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** That is not Song's voice at all.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** That's not how they talk.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** That's not how they talk.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** They talk.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:48]** They talk.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:51]** So Song, the door opens.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** Oh, what?

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:52]** Song is agender.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** So the door opens.

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:01]** And then I don't think – here's maybe you're looking at them.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:04]** You can see them.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** They're behind Dr. OK.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:10]** And you see their mouth just become this thin line.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:17]** they immediately starts to reach into their pocket and pull out some sort of communicator, take a step back.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:28]** Doctor, okay, you heard the door open, and you can hear Song talking into their communicator, saying like, you got something going on down here.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:31]** Talking very quickly, but very intently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:35]** Get into this fight, Song.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** It is Dr.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** O.K.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:38]** 's turn.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** No, okay.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:43]** Wait, what song is it?

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Fight song?

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** Never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** This is my fight song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** Is that it?

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** All right.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** Wait, who sings that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Is that Katy Perry?

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** Kelly Clarkson?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Kelly Clarkson?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** I don't know.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:56]** Kelly Perry?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:58]** They all sound the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** No, they don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** They don't.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:01]** You're right.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** I don't actually know.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** Okay, what are you doing on your turn, Doctor?

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** Okay.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** Rachel Platten.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:09]** Sorry, everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Oh, Rachel.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** Of course, everyone knows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:15]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:23]** So, I'm going to step back over to here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:43]** on fire with my uh costa jet liquidator you were here correct yes okay technically that is an attack of opportunity was it now that you're stepping away from a threatened square but he didn't the the lives couldn't reach me in the last turn

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:47]** The last round, but now it is the next round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** Oh, I see.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** So I need to take a guarded step back is what you're saying?

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:54]** You could take a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:54]** Yes.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:57]** A guarded step would be your move action, though.

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** That would be your entire move action.

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** The whole move action.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** That is the whole move action.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:05]** I could do a... I thought he was going to reach for the whiskey.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:10]** Which I've now put in on roll 20.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:17]** Yeah, you can see all the nice refreshments from Song that are on the center table.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** Yeah, right?

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** There's, like, sushi.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:21]** There are, yeah, space sushi.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** Castrovelian fish, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** I think I see the whiskey.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:28]** It looks like there's some soju.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:28]** Soju.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** And some, like, bread.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** What are these green bottles?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:40]** Yeah, they're, like, an alcohol that's, you know, from around Grand Marnier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Is it flammable?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** Oh, ideas do you have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** Ideas the doctor has.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** If you really want to.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** No, I'm okay.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:57]** Dr. Okay's okay.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:04]** So I can draw a weapon, a different weapon, and attack if I don't move.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** If you don't move, correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:09]** Rick, you have a plus one to your base attack bonus.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** Nico, I think you do.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** Dr. Okay does not, right?

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** Yet?

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** Yeah, not yet.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:18]** Yeah, so you pulling out that weapon is your move action.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:19]** Then you got your attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:20]** Okay.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:25]** I am going to pull out my tactical syringe spear.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** Okay.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:33]** And load it up with another pharmacological inhibitor and hit this.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** Actually, no.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:39]** I'm going to use the minor boost or minor inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** Okay.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:48]** And, uh, hit this louse in the... in the thorax, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** In the thorax?

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** Okay.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:50]** Crack die.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:51]** Oh.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:55]** So, who wants to explain what a crack die is?

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:57]** I don't know what it is.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Nose ghost?

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:58]** Nose ghost.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** Nose ghost.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** I have no idea what a crack die is.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** I don't know what it is.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** I can't even explain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:06]** I'll go, but I... It's where a die falls down and it breaks.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** How do you guys not know what a crack die is?

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** I am Dostoevsky in this game.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:13]** A crack die is when it's like... I'm so excited I rolled a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:18]** I don't want to explain what I did.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** Oh, that's unfortunate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** Wait, wait, a 20 on the crack die?


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:22]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:27]** reroll.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:31]** You guys are like, somebody who explained a cracked eye and I'm just like, I want to say it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:39]** That is not our, that is not our, no, that is not our critical hit sound.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:46]** Our critical hit sound is, that's our critical hit sound.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:49]** Or, or possibly, one, two, three, four.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** I vote for that one.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:59]** I kind of like that as like a crit sound.

**[00:33:59 - 00:33:59]** That's good.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:05]** So you don't have to have bad implications in combat, though, if you're telling the enemy to get up.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:07]** That's true.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** No, you're just taunting them.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** Get down!

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:11]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:16]** If you roll a 20, you're a sex machine, and that's what that song's all about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** That's what that song's all about.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:19]** A sluggy sex machine.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:23]** All right, we're going to keep moving on that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:25]** Wait, what is the Cracked Eye?

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:32]** So a crack die is when you roll the dice and it's on some kind of surface that allows it to balance between two values.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:34]** I don't know who came up with it.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:38]** It could be... It probably rolled into a crack is where the crack die comes from.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** We could look it up on Wikipedia.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** Crack die is an old term.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** An old term?


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** Okay.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:45]** Well, you jump on that research, Kev.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** We got a crit to deal with right now.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:50]** So just a quick thing.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:57]** I was reading the rules of the Starfinder official critical hit deck, and you can deal the damage, right?

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** I think this is what we did last time.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:01]** You deal the damage as well as what is on the card.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:05]** So the extra crit damage plus what's on here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:08]** Plus my weapon has a plus two injection on crit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:10]** That is super dangerous.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** Awesome.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Plus two to the DC, right?

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:17]** So it makes the DC harder for whatever thing they have.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:17]** Okay.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:19]** So you want to do the crit deck?

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:19]** Is that what we're doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:24]** So wait, do I have a choice of that or double damage or...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:26]** No, so this... I get to see both, right?

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Yes!

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** So if you use the deck... Okay, cool.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Ready?

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:32]** Three, two, one, go.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:32]** Now.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:39]** Okay, so for everyone not listening, I am, like, fluttering through the cards with some magical flourish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** If they're not listening, they don't care.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:41]** What?

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** Thanks, Kevin.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:44]** Why would you say that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:46]** Everybody not listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:48]** Oh, I see.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:53]** Okay, so for everyone listening, I did it in a magical flourish, and then Will tells me when to stop.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:59]** I cut the deck, and this is a... What kind of effect is this?

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** This is a kinetic hit, right?

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:03]** Yes.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:04]** Okay.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** Okay, so low blow.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:12]** So it's the normal crit damage, and the target is sickened for 2d4 rounds.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** Nice.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:14]** Nice.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** All right, so what is your damage?

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** Twice.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** And I will look up sickened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** What?

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:28]** It's probably going to die because the tactical is 1d6, so I get to roll 2d6, right?

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:28]** Yeah.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:30]** Or do I just double what I roll on 1?

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** No, no, no.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** You roll 2d6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** That's six points.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:36]** Six points?

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:37]** Total?

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:37]** Yeah.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Total.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:39]** Okay.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** So six points of damage.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** Awesome.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** It's still living.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** It's still living.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** It's probably not best life.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:51]** And it is encumbered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** It has to roll for the entangled condition.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** Fort save, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** So I hit it with the pharmacological.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:03]** So it is sickened for 2d4 rounds.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:11]** Let me roll that real quick, and then we will roll the save to see me dig in my dice goblin thing of dice here.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:11]** I've just


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** Come on, entangled condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** Do it.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:18]** The asteroid Laos is sickened for four rounds.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:25]** So that is a minus two to attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** So it's minus two.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:29]** So it gets hit with this inhibitor.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** Its body does not take.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** It takes minus two to a saving throw.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** There's already a plus two to the DC.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** So what kind of saving throw is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** Four, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:40]** That is.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:46]** It failed with a five.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** Nice.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Yeah.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:49]** Yep.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** Yep.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:50]** Okay.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** So, wow.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** This asteroid life is just not having a good time.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** Encumbered for four rounds still.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** Sickened for four rounds.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** And now entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** For how long?

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** Six rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:06]** For six rounds.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:07]** Wow.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:08]** Wow.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** Move at half speed.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:11]** Can't run or charge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** Minus two penalty to your AC.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:16]** To AC and skill checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:20]** And attack rolls and reflex saving throws and initiative checks and dex base attacks.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:21]** Wow.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** That is insane.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** Can I just say that?

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** That that is insane.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:28]** It didn't die from the six damage?

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:30]** It did not die from the six damage.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** Well, it wishes it did.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:35]** It probably absolutely wishes that it did.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:38]** That is, yeah, not super fun.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:41]** It is Keeve's turn.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** Got real quiet.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:45]** Unless there's anything else you want to do on your roll, Doctor, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:47]** This bug is stubborn.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:53]** Hey, Sog, where the hell are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:57]** Keeve, it's Keeve's turn.

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:08]** Keeve, seeing that Hears has just killed the asteroid Laos that was on Professor Benjam, looks up at Hears and they nod their head.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:16]** And you can tell from the goggles, you can't quite see their eyes, but it seems like they've got an appreciative smile on their face.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:18]** They nod at Hears.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:21]** And then they look over, they see the asteroid lice.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:27]** Nico having fired at the asteroid lice to the left in the cafeteria.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:36]** Keeve takes some steps over and swings this multi-tool at the asteroid louse.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:38]** Come on, Keeve, what do you get?

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:49]** Ooh, that's a 15, and it breaks the Asteroid Louse's KAC, doing some damage, two points of damage.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:51]** So you all see Keeb come over.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:58]** They take this multi-tool, and they slam it down and crack the back of the Asteroid Louse.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:02]** It is Rick19's turn.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** What are you doing?

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** The Asteroid Louse in front of you looks like

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:08]** Pretty hurt.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Pretty hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** That's exciting for me.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:17]** Before we do that, though, I went down a rabbit hole with the research I was doing.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:20]** I didn't find any origin information on cracked die.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** Oh, okay.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:30]** There was some people saying it's a cocked die, and then they heard cracked die from Glass Cannon Podcast, which is another role-playing podcast.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** It's a great podcast.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** It's actually great to listen to.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:32]** Yep.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** Phenomenal.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** Phenomenal.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:50]** Also, with the movement stuff, it looks like you cannot split your move unless you have certain feats that allow you to do it, like Spring Attack, which says move before and after a melee attack.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** That's an attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:52]** Yeah.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:57]** I feel like for banter, you just say something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** I understood, and I explained that earlier.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:02]** You want banter, I'm talking attacks because I'm a soldier and I don't talk much.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:08]** You just want to destroy everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Talk to the guy.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** Speaking of destroying things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:13]** Speaking of destroying things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:38]** kill this book so so on his in the last six seconds uh rick had pushed this thing off of him and then like raised his gun but it's still kind of just like below his shoulder so this time he's gonna actually yank that uh his giant rifle up to his shoulder and aim it much better um and so he's gonna pull the trigger and he got an 11 plus 5 is a 16 oh baby that's a hit

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** Yeah, that's a hit.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** I know it's a hit.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** I shouldn't have even asked.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:41]** I don't know why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** Why did you ask?

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:44]** Why did you ask?

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** I don't know.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:48]** Minus five to your roll for asking so you don't hit.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:48]** That's it.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:49]** Ouch.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** That's it.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:50]** Tough.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** Tough break.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** All right.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** What's your damage?

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:55]** You got to use your sweet key workshop dice here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:00]** I know, I'm trying to use my dice, but then, like, the... The modifiers?

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:04]** Okay, so it's... Should we listen to some music while you're waiting?

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** Yeah.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** What should we listen to while we're waiting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:11]** I guess the waves are good in Africa.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:12]** Oh, yeah!


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:13]** Yeah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:19]** That just starts playing over the speakers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:23]** I'm glad people can't see this because I'm terrible at dancing while I'm sitting in a chair.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** No, you're great at dancing.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:27]** It's a d10 of fire damage.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** And I have this fancy die.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:33]** So if it lands on the Starfinder symbol... Then the Starfinders win the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** And then that's how you win Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:38]** Oh, it did the opposite of that and landed on a 2.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** On a 2?

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** A fire damage.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** You're joking.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** Two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** Had two points left.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:44]** I bet you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:48]** Had three points left.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:48]** No!

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:52]** One HP left.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** There are no modifiers to your D10.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** There's no D10 plus one.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** No, it's just a D10.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** It's just a D10.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** Oh, Rick19.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:03]** More like Rick2.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** Rick2.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:04]** Rick2.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** Oh, my God.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:07]** Anything else you want to do on your turn?


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:10]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:10]** No?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:11]** No.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** All right.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** It's not latched on me, right?

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:13]** Just to clarify.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** It's not attached to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** Don't worry, Rick.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:19]** We will Rick to fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** Wow.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:26]** I don't know how to fucking do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:30]** I didn't always make terrible puns, but when I did, I was on Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:37]** Whenever we make puns, I think I'm just going to give you a D4 that you can use with any role that you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** Yes!

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** Also, we need the Wilhelm scream.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** This is just like in the negative silence.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** John, I love that.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** I feel like it's going to be overpowered.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** It's probably going to be OP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:50]** That's true, yeah.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:52]** But they have to be just real bad puns.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:55]** Oh, even better.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** Why don't we table it?

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** We'll think about it.

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** That was pretty bad.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:04]** I'm inclined, but let's as a group talk about it next episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:08]** I already brought out my D4 for my roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:13]** You went into your storage, got your D4, so you might as well use it now for whatever roll you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** Why don't we just make it a critical fail while we're at it?

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:22]** Why is it a failure to come up with amazingly bad puns?

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:24]** Because you critically failed on the pun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** All right.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** Let's get back to the chimera.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:29]** Notably, the galley.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** Here's what are you doing on your turn now?

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:33]** You going to 2M again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** No.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:38]** Here's can tell that this louse is close to death.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** The one in front of Rick.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:42]** So he's going to saunter up.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Saunter?

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:46]** Actually, I don't know if I can make it to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Well, he's a very like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** You got 30 feet.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:56]** Note that the remains in front of you, if you step on them.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** Yeah, that's a problem.

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:00]** You will get some injury.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** Burn, baby, burn.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:03]** Oh, we need that clip.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** Yeah.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:04]** Such a good song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Yeah, it's a good clip.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** Yep.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:07]** So here's Will.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** As you said, Santer up.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** He's going to go right behind.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:12]** Okay.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** This boog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:18]** So 5, 15, and then... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** You made it.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:19]** Cool.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:21]** Although I think you're standing on top of Keith.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:24]** Can I diagonally attack this beast here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** Yeah.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** Totally, totally.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:30]** You actually hit 30 feet perfectly because you only moved in diagonals four times.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:33]** So that was great.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** That was good.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:42]** It's almost like you were looking at a top-down view of the map, and you could determine what you wanted to do, and you weren't actually... Here's the Sheeran wasn't actually doing this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:46]** All right, so your diagonally is a terrible... I can see a lot of things, all right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** It's a terrible characteristic.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** He only walks in diagonals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** He's like a pawn.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:53]** Sheeran only walks in diagonals.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** Yeah.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** Honey crisps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** All right.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:58]** Honey, what?

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** Well, you said honey.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Sorry, sorry, sorry.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** Like the cereal?

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:04]** Okay.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** So good.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:08]** So I'm going to do, he's going to do an unarmed strike on him.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** Nice.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:15]** And so that's going to be a four to hit.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** And yeah, it's a four to hit.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:17]** Does that hit?

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:18]** That does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:23]** Everybody was kung fu mating.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:23]** Oh, I missed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** No, you missed.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** What do you do?

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** Do you kick it?

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:28]** He crab walked all the way around.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:32]** He crab walked around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** Yeah, really disoriented.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:38]** And so instead of attacking, like, directly in front of him, he attacked diagonally.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** And then, like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:51]** Yeah, you're trying to squeeze through Keeve and Broden Benjamin, who is looking at his leg, seeing the two points of damage that he took.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:55]** And you're just a little disoriented, trying to get through and attack.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** It's okay.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:57]** Yeah, it's okay.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** It's all good.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** It's all good.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** You're fine.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** Good attempt.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:02]** Good attempt.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** It is...

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** Oh, wow.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** I've been dreading this moment.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:09]** It is the asteroid Laos' turn that is next to Dr. Okay.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** No.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:15]** And I feel like... He's lost the will to live.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:18]** It's going to attack you.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:33]** And by my calculations, it will have a minus two from being sickened, a minus two from being entangled, and there is no more, right?

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** Minus four, there is no more?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:36]** Should we see?

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:41]** Yeah, I don't even know what my DC is for my armor class.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:41]** I don't even know where it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:48]** You should probably look for your KAC and EAC, mostly your KAC, because it rolled an 18!

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:51]** to attach to you, but it can't even move.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:56]** So it's going to reach out and try and grab onto you.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:56]** Fuck.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** Yeah, that works.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** Yeah.

**[00:47:59 - 00:47:59]** So what's your KC?

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** 13.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** 13.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** Okay.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:04]** So somehow...

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** Maybe you were just, you thought it was cool.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** You thought it was fine.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** You were safe.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:17]** And you just feel one of its pincers just slip into your body.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** No damage.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:22]** But it is now attached.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:25]** And I can use a strength check to get it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** You can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:28]** Correctamundo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** And it gets a minus.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:33]** So the DC is lower because of all the conditions, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** Good question.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** No, that was just the DC for you, not for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:42]** John, is this thing trying to grapple him now?

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:42]** Is that what we're doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:45]** No, it's this special ability called Attach.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** It's the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** Oh, because Grapple goes against KAC plus 8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** You're right, but it's not Grapple.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:51]** It's an Attach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:54]** Sounds like Grapple to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** If you look in the Alien Archives...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** I'm just saying it sounds like grapple.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:01]** You're right, but it has a special thing called attach.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** That's not grapple because it's attached.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:06]** It says just like grapple, but not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** But it's attached.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:10]** Mechanically, it's different because he's the DM.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:14]** No, I mean, you can look.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** Should I share my screen?

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** No, it's fine.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Should I share my screen?

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** I sort of trust you.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:25]** I mean, look, there's a fine line of trust that you have to have between players and GMs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:30]** And I'm not trying to... It's not there for us.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** We don't trust you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:33]** Appendix 4.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:35]** Universal creature rules.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:35]** Attach.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:40]** The creature can attempt a special attack against KAC as a standard action.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:45]** If it succeeds, it deals no damage, but the creature adheres to its target.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** Once attached, it gains this.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** And yes, yes, yes, yes.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:51]** An attached creature can be removed with a successful strength check.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:55]** Type in attached into Google and Starfinder.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** No, I trust you, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:57]** Okay.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** I trust you.

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** Cool.

**[00:49:59 - 00:49:59]** Cool beans.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:02]** I was just reading the section about...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:18]** convenient that you were reading that's all I do is I just I know you just read this whole time reading but am I rolling against the creature's strength check like strength not right now when I when I want to remove it no there's just a flat DC for it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:21]** So it is Professor Benjam's turn.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** Let's keep it rolling.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:33]** Professor Benjam sits down into his chair, starts to examine the wound on his leg from the asteroid Laos that he has then killed.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:43]** It is the top of round four, and it's the asteroid Laos in front of Rick's turn with one HP left.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:45]** Here's just punched it.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:45]** I'm just saying.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:46]** Here's punched it.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:47]** Yes.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:48]** Here's tried.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Let's see.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** Keeve also did something.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:55]** I'm just saying, yeah, he doesn't have to attack Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** That's true.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:58]** Okay.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:58]** You know what?

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** For fun, let's do the old D6.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:03]** One, two, attacks Rick.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** Three, four, attacks Hears.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** Five, six, attacks Key.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:07]** See that?

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** I rolled real high on persuasion.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:11]** You rolled real high on persuasion.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** And it's Sunday.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** We're recording on a Sunday.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** Things are different.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:16]** It's like opposite day.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** It's fine.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:17]** That's a three.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** It's going to go for Hears.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** Oh, sorry, Hears.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:24]** Get your bug self ready.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** Your apology is not accepted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** It's going to be over.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:31]** That's a KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** Just trying to help.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** Yeah, that does not hit.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:35]** Definitely does not hit.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:39]** Nico, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:39]** What are you doing?

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:41]** Nico is just going to take one pistol.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** He's going to point it at this bug.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:46]** He's just like, someone call the piss control.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** He's going to take a shot.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** That doesn't get a D4.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** Okay, take a shot.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:56]** Oh, we're looking at a 16 plus 3.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** You got it, IT.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** Cha-ching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:59 - 00:51:59]** Wow.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** Cha-ching.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:02]** That's pretty sweet.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** Cha-ching.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:05]** Just poof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:05]** Ow!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:09]** So, what is your damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** Damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** Damage.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Damage.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** Tell me your damage.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** Oh, there's that roll.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** One.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** No way.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** It had one lip.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:24]** You killed it.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** Well done.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** That is awesome.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:32]** It dies trying to go for ears.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:34]** Gets blown.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:40]** You see its remains start to get all on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:47]** As Nico watches all the corrosive acid fall to the floor, he's just going to say, when you need pest control, call Orkin.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:48]** No.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:48]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:54]** I thought that your company, that Nico's company, was not a pest control company.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** It's not a pest control company.

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:00]** I actually named a real pest control company for the purposes of a joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:01]** Okay.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:04]** Well, now we have to, if we're going to keep it in there, we have to credit them.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** So we have to put in an ad for Orkin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** I'm sure they wouldn't mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:10]** It's Song, sir.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Do we know, though?

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** No, no, we don't.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:18]** So Song walks up, walks over to you, Dr.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:24]** O.K., and they look and say, what is going on here?

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:26]** What is happening?

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:29]** Why are these insects in my cafeteria here?

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:31]** Can you please explain what is going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:36]** Can you explain why you've got some fuchi sushi on the table?

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** I don't fucking know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** Was that your official response?

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:44]** No, I just don't know what to say today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:48]** Tell them what happened.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** Tell them what happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** There's a reaction I'm going to say.

**[00:53:52 - 00:54:00]** Hey, I don't know what you're serving here, but these lice aren't on the menu, eh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:00]** Eh?

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Eh?

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:01]** Dr.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:01]** O.K.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:01]** 's Canadian.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** Dr.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:02]** O.K.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:02]** 's Canadian.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** I spend a lot of time in Canada.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:06]** I didn't know that you were Canadian.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** I would have changed my whole conversation with you, Doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:10]** I'm from the great white north of Quebec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:15]** You're from... Boom.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** All right, it's your turn, Doctor.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** Okay, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:22]** Yeah, so I'm going to use the full action.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** Full action.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** Full it up.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** Yeah.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:25]** Full attack.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** Full it up.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:31]** Because I think that way I can perform the strength...

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** Check.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** Yep.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** And also attack, right?

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:41]** Or is getting unhooked from him... That would be your move action.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** That's what we rule that it's your move action.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** So I can just do a regular attack then?


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:45]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:46]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:50]** Okay, so I'm going to... But I have to make a strength check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** Yes.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:58]** And I have decided that I will lower the DC by two because the creature has three conditions.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** Encumbered, entangled, and sickened.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:01]** Seems kind of low.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:04]** I think you'll pass the strength check.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** I'm being generous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** What are you doing?

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:11]** Yeah, I'm going to try and get out of the... Get it off you.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:11]** Get it off you.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:12]** Do it.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:14]** 14 on the die.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** Easy.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** You just... How do you throw it off?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:39]** I wrap my tendrils around him, and I... With my oiliness, I just sort of squeeze like a constrictor around the fangs that are injected into my skin, and I can easily pull him off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:41]** Like, I squeeze him out.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** Like, pop it a pimple, almost.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** Like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** Comes out, hits the floor.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** What are you doing now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:55]** I'm going to hit him with the syringe stick.

**[00:55:55 - 00:56:02]** And I'm going to load it up with a minor inhibitor.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:09]** So on top of all of this is now going to encumbered entangled second.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:09]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:13]** It's going to, if successful.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** Yes.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:16]** This is a cocktail of crazy things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:19]** Page 43 of the character operations manual.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:20]** Yep.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:31]** Biohack imposes a slight hindrance on target, takes a minus one penalty to attack rolls for six rounds because that's three plus my key ability score.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Give me that roll.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:36]** 13.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:39]** 13 against?

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** KAC.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** Against KAC.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:46]** It does have some negatives on it, right?

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:48]** You hit it for sure.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:49]** Easily.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:49]** 100% you hit it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:53]** I'm going to go ahead.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** Can I actually roll a D4?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** You can.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:02]** Oh, for the pun?

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:02]** Yeah, for the pun.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:04]** Oh, no.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:11]** You can't just add in damage where there wasn't any to begin with, but I was going to ask you.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** What is the D4 then for?

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:17]** where we decided that we're going to table the D4 and decide, and then next time we'll figure it out.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:22]** So encumbered, entangled, sickened, minus one to AC or attack rolls?

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** From the most recent injection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:24]** Oh, from the injection?

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** Attack rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** Okay, attack rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:28]** It is.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:30]** But it gets damaged, too.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** Three points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** Oh, three points of damage too.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:34]** Things are definitely going your way.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** It's still alive.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:40]** Seems to be just moving slow, but it is still alive.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** And it is Keeve's turn.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:47]** And Keeve turns and looks at Niko.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:53]** peers around here and looks at Nico and says, thank you.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:58]** And then just starts to look around, try to see if there's anything.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** There's still another louse over here.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:09]** So Keeve is going to move over to here and as if to attack the asteroid louse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:11]** Rick, what are you doing?

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** All right.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:15]** So, oh man, can I just jump over to this thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:18]** You could jump.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:21]** I would give you acrobatics to jump over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:24]** Let me see my acrobatics abilities before I do this.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** Just in case.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:29]** I'm pretty sure they're pretty high.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** Acrobatics.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:31]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** Acrobatics plus five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** Yeah, you're fine.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:36]** You're going to jump over the caustic remains of this asteroid last?

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:37]** Yeah.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:42]** So I got a 13 plus five, so 18 for my acrobatics.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** You sail over it.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** All right, so just like Rick.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** Like a hurdler.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** Yeah, flies.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** Without even trying.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:47]** Do you dive?

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** Skips over this thing.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:48]** Do you dive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:49]** Do you dive over it?

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** Yeah, and he rolls.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** And he rolls?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** All right, so dives and rolls across.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** And then what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:59]** So that's one, two, three, four, five.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** So he's going to go all the way to here.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:02]** That table's giving us cover.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:02]** How does cover work again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:11]** The table is going to give soft cover, so it's going to get a little plus to its AC, but it already has so much going on that you can tell that it's not really moving.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:18]** So it does have a bonus, but it will probably get swallowed up by all the stuff that it has going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:28]** Okay, so Rick is going to then level his rifle, and I got a nine to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** Ooh, wow.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:29]** Wow.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:37]** A nine, the plus two with partial cove, the minus two from the entangled.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:40]** Oh, you just miss.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:47]** It was EAC 10 to hit the twos, cancel out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:50]** That bolt just strikes the tabletop and bounces away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:52]** Yeah, just bounces away.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:54]** Wow, that was so close.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:56]** Anything else you want to do on your turn?

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** That's it.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:58]** Okay.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** Here's you're up.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:09]** Hears has something called Spell Cache, where he can use it to cast any one spell for free once a day.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:11]** So he's going to do that with Magic Missile.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:17]** And it will take a full turn to do that, so that will be... How long does Spell Cache take to cast?

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** What's the duration of Spell Cache?

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:20]** I think it's immediate.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:21]** Oh, okay.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** Sweet.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:23]** Yeah.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** Okay.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:24]** Sweet.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:27]** So you shoot three... Just die already.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:28]** Okay.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:31]** It's 3d4 plus 3.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** Roll high.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** 10 damage.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:36]** 10 damage.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:37]** All right.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** Yeah.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:46]** So, Rick, as you shoot, you shoot and you see the laser just bounce off the table.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:53]** And right after that, you feel this whoosh of air as three magic missiles come around.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:58]** And you think for a second, you're like, oh, I can get another shot off.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:03]** And then you just see the bug explode once again.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:07]** And it is dead.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** Thanks, guys.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:10]** And that is our game.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:13]** You took care of them.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:15]** You finally took them out.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:18]** Only took two episodes, but it happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:24]** Hey there, this is Will Garrett of Will Save the Podcast.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:26]** I get asked all the time if we're related.
