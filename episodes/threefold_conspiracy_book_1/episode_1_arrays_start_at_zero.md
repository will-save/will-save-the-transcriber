## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:00:45 - 00:01:02]** I want you guys to close your eyes.

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:02]** Just take a second.

**[00:01:03 - 00:01:06]** Kev, I see you've opened them and close them...

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:07]** There you go, yeah.

**[00:01:07 - 00:01:13]** If you're listening, if you're not doing something that, uh,

**[00:01:14 - 00:01:17]** requires you to have your eyes open and close them.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:21]** So cutting steak, operating forklift, lawnmower.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:27]** If you can safely close your eyes, please do so.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:30]** Close your eyes and let them adjust.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** Take a deep breath.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:39]** Relax the muscles around your eyes.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:43]** You might see what appear to be gentle flashes of shapes

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:51]** or waves, or maybe dots, little neon lights fading, appearing, coming together, and then drifting away.

**[00:01:53 - 00:02:05]** If you close them a little tighter and you try to focus, some colors start to form, translucent red, blue, green, purple, like ripples in a pond.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:13]** Begin to envision these colors growing brighter, swirling together, until it fills your entire vision.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** Let it fill your imagination.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** And see my words.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** Everything goes black.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:33]** There's a small gray dot that materializes in front of you.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:38]** That dot is larger, although now it has these small little shapes moving around it.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:47]** We're closer, and it appears to be a circular, flat space station scoured with marks.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:53]** Two rings, one large and one small, rotate around the station.

**[00:02:53 - 00:03:04]** Little dots that are probably ships buzz towards the center, moving between the rings and three large, intersecting domes that cap off the station disk.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:14]** Zoom in on the domes and we see an opaque mix of swirling gas that presses against the otherwise transparent surface.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:20]** Slowly, the outer ring rotates into view and we see a name.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** Legacy Station.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:30]** We see the exterior of the docking bay is covered with ships.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** We're closer now.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:39]** Some ships are gray, some gold, some green with biophilic surfaces, and others made of unrecognizable material.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:48]** All of them are lined up, connected to the station via airlocks.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:56]** We're now inside the station itself, inside one small secluded docking bay.

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** and the sounds of hissing pipes and engine maintenance fill the air.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:08]** The small waiting area feels dark as we only see three light sources.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:14]** Purple sconces on the wall that illuminate a small waiting area for passengers.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:25]** The cool blue lights of the gangway stairs and the white light of the entrance to the ship known as the Chimera.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:31]** Above you, Viztor posters of the Vescarium and notable Vesks.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:41]** Skittermanders and other races adorn the walls, the legacy of an older style when the excitement of a station in near space was new.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:54]** But Legacy Station, Docking Bay 18, now feels cold and transient as cargo and darkness sit piled along the Western Wall.

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:02]** You guys can open your eyes if it helps you to keep imagining.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:06]** Dusty benches sit unused near the loading platform.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:14]** Yellow stripes border a dark blue path leading to the ship's entrance.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:22]** And on either side of the path gather a small group of people.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:26]** They're quiet, uneasy, all looking at the same place.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:36]** a small, blue-skinned Lushunta woman, standing in the center, antennae relaxed, dressed in deep blue and gold.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:46]** Everyone around looks like they're anxious, ready to leave, to board, but her mouth opens to speak.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:52]** Now, everyone, this will only take a few moments.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:58]** I am Agent Larue, that's L-A-R-U-E, and I'm a special agent of the stewards.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:02]** That's S-T-E-W-A-R-D-S.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:11]** I just need to ask each of you a few questions, and then I guarantee you can all continue with your departure.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:15]** She pauses, looks down at a datapad.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:20]** I can, however, rule out some of you.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:23]** You may board first.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:30]** This group, she points to a hobgoblin surrounded by four smaller, chittering space goblins.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:35]** The hobgoblin's green skin is covered in tattoos.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:40]** Their long, pointed ears hold up a sturdy armor cap.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:44]** The goblins around are eagerly standing...


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:50]** As well as the Vesk you may board.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:59]** She points to a stout, burly Vesk with a short tail and a handsome beard of horns that adorn his underbite.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:08]** They all turn, slowly pick up their luggage, goblins still chattering, and begin to head towards the ramp slowly.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:13]** The Lushunta woman turns to face the remaining group.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:19]** I'll be asking questions of the rest of you again.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:22]** My apologies, this shouldn't take too long.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:30]** And we do appreciate your patience, myself and the stewards.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:39]** She walks over to a Kasathan woman and asks her to step forward.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:42]** The Kasathan woman is tall, dressed well.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:52]** casually as if for travel, all forearms covered down to the wrist in a silk garment.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:56]** They speak quietly in hushed tones for a short time.

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:07]** Agent Larue seems to be asking her some questions and the Kasathan seems to be talking casually.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:09]** No tension.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:12]** Larue eventually nods and she says,

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:16]** Please wait for a moment here.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:22]** Then she turns and she walks over to a man.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** Kevin, what does this man look like?


## Kevin Decker

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** He's a... Hi, everybody, I'm Kevin.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:31]** He's a gruff, young human.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:34]** He's got short, brownish hair.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:37]** He's got, like, a 5 o'clock shadow going on.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:48]** And it's very obvious, but, like, right below his chin line, there are what seems like electronics or, like, metallic things running down his neck.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** Probably some kind of, like, implant.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:55]** He's played by a young Harrison Ford circa, like, I don't know, 1982?

## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:58]** Like Blade Runner Harrison Ford?

## Kevin Decker

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** Say again?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:58]** Like a blade runner Harrison Ford?


## Kevin Decker

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** Yeah, yeah. Thats what I'm thinking like.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:05]** Indiana Jones height of stardom Harrison Ford.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** Yeah, you know, like.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:05]** Indiana Jones height of stardom Harrison Ford.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:08]** Just fresh off being a carpenter.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:12]** He's wearing a trench coat with the collar popped up a little bit.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:12]** Yeah.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:13]** Nice.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:14]** Nice.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:17]** That's awesome.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** Good afternoon.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:23]** I just have a couple questions for you before you go on your way.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** Uh, one, what is your name?


## Kevin Decker (RICK-19)

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** I go by the name of Rick.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Alright, Rick.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** Pleasure.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:36]** Uh, what is your purpose for traveling to Absalon Station?


## Kevin Decker (RICK-19)

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:40]** I am returning to Absalon Station after a mission.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** Alright, thank you.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:45]** Kinda notes something down.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:51]** And, uh, could you please explain your whereabouts in the past 24 hours?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:09:52 - 00:10:04]** Her words, 24 hours, 24 hours, 24 hours, ring in your ears as you remember back to what occurred.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:11]** Blackout.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:20]** We move down a back alley and see the shape of a tall man in a long brown trench coat protruding from the alley wall.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:29]** Moving closer, he lowers his hands slowly, and in the dim light, we see the glint of a pistol.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:46]** His face conveys concern, covert intentions as he glimpses around the corner, and we pan over to see the back of a very large Vesk in a disheveled space suit, grime and dirt smeared all over the fabric.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:50]** The Vesk climbs a ladder,

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:53]** And the man, low and silent, follows.

**[00:10:55 - 00:11:00]** As the man gets to the top, he takes one last look down as the city pulls away.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:09]** On the roof, the Vesk, looking up, stands alone among a forest of machinery painted in floodlights.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:20]** The bio-lights from the station screens far, far overhead indicated the stars were about to make way to a cloudy morning sky.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:26]** The man's voice seems steady, despite the odd sense of anticipation he felt.


## Kevin Decker (RICK-19)

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:30]** Keep your hands where I can see them, Tomaz.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** I'm taking you in.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:38]** Tomaz raises his hands over his head and turns slightly.


## Jon Swan (Tomaz)

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:44]** Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** I thought you were supposed to be good.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:50]** Aren't you the good man?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:53]** Tomas locks his eyes onto the man's.


## Jon Swan (Tomaz)

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:58]** Or are you just a machine, following orders?


## Kevin Decker (RICK-19)

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:03]** The android abolition front has something to say about your recent activities.


## Jon Swan (Tomaz)

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:05]** Think for yourself for once.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:19]** Tomaz considers, lowers and spreads his arms wide, turning around, and takes a few steps towards the android, a smile growing on his face.


## Jon Swan (Tomaz)

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:23]** Why do you think I'm up here?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:31]** In a flash, Tamaz's tail lashes around and knocks the gun out of the android's hand.


## Jon Swan (Tomaz)

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** Come on, android!

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** If you're not going to answer, then show me what you're made of!


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:40]** Tamaz crouches and charges to tackle the android.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:44]** The android tumbles backwards and pushes the Vesk off of him.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:48]** As the android stands, Tamaz swings his muscular Vesk's tail.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:52]** The android clasps two sturdy hands together, catching the Vesk's tail.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:58]** Twisting his hip, the android pivots and throws Tomaz away from him towards the roof's edge.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:02]** Tomaz slowly stands up, unfazed.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:06]** He looks at the android, who has his gun back in his hand.


## Kevin Decker (RICK-19)

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** Just surrender.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:14]** The android takes a step forward into a cone from the floodlight.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:22]** As he does out of the corner of his eyes, his retinas register the influx of photons as a flash.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:26]** And turning his head towards it, his vision blurs.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:32]** New sounds are processed by his auditory sensors.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** The android hesitates.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** His gun hand begins to shake.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:42]** What begins as a small sound in the back of his throat widens and amplifies as the android screams into the white hell.


## Kevin Decker (RICK-19)

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** _(screams in anguish)_


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** A shadow darts across the white screen.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** The android reacts.

**[00:13:53 - 00:14:03]** The haze fades, revealing the image of Tamaz standing on the edge of the rooftop.


## Jon Swan (Tomaz)

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:07]** It seems that this is my time to die.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:12]** A spot of blood spreads over Tomaz's spacesuit.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:15]** Tomaz loses his balance, toppling backwards over the edge.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:19]** The android stands still in disbelief.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:25]** He's breathing quickly, looking at his gun, still pointing at the air where Tomas once was.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:30]** He raises his wrist and sends out a message.


## Kevin Decker (RICK-19)

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** The target has been terminated.


## Jon Swan (unknown)

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** At least you tried.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:39]** Your next mission will come soon.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** Head to Absalom Station.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:44]** A notification is pushed on his device.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:48]** His trip back to Absalom boards in two hours.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** He looks up at the floodlight.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:51]** It flickers.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:52]** Hums.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:56]** He wonders what awaits him in Absalom.

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:02]** And, looking back at his device, the name of the ship scrolls onto the screen... Blackout


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:13]** Well, Kev, that is, uh... You're a murder bot.


## Cast, et al.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** _(laughter)_


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** So simple.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:23]** As if one word could encapsulate your whole story.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** Yep.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:31]** I'm sorry, uh, could... You started to say something.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:34]** Where were you in the past 24 hours?

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:37]** Was it related to this mission, you said?


## Kevin Decker (RICK-19)

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:48]** I was staying at a hotel, and my mission was to collect an article from a local gun dealer.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:51]** Hmm.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:51]** All right.


## Kevin Decker (RICK-19)

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:54]** I was unable to get a hold of the gun dealer.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:59]** Okay, well, I don't need your whole life story, but thank you.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** Thank you.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:01]** All right.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:03]** She takes a few steps away.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** Is there anything that you would like to ask me?

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:06]** No, yes.


## Kevin Decker (RICK-19)

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** No.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:14]** She kind of taps her pen on her data pad a couple times, looks up, thinking.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:23]** She walks past all of you, up to a woman standing at a monitor station next to the Chimera's entrance.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:32]** A transitional Rhyphorian, tan with tipped ears, brown eyes, short brown hair.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:36]** She's wearing, imposing a armor, white and yellow.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:40]** The jacket and a collar is a functioning part of the armor.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Will, don't Google that.


## Will Garrett

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:52]** Wow. Thanks, bud.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** I Googled Rhyphorian.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** Sorry.


## Jon Swan

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:57]** No, Rhyphorian is fine.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** Just be careful what you do.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** Oh, my God.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:04]** They're like little kids still.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:17]** As Agent LaRue starts to walk back, they've talked for a minute, we see the Hobgoblin, one who was dismissed from Agent LaRue, walking up.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:20]** Algiada's face stiffens a little bit.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:23]** See her mouth barely moving.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:30]** It's at this point that the Kasathan turns to you, Rick.


## Jon Swan (Magwa)

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:33]** Excuse me.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:37]** Have you seen anything like this before?

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:41]** This delay here.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** It's unreasonable.


## Kevin Decker (RICK-19)

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:47]** It seems like there is some kind of investigation going on.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** I have seen this.


## Jon Swan (Magwa)

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:56]** Well, maybe it is par for your profession.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** I have not.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:59]** I'm very, very confused.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:02]** It's quite irritating.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** I'm Magwa, by the way.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:08]** She reaches out one of her lower hands to you.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** Shake your hand.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:15]** He reaches back and firmly shakes her hand, and he says, 


## Kevin Decker (RICK-19)

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:17]** I'm Rick 19.


## Jon Swan (Magwa)

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** Pleasure to meet you, Rick 19.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:24]** It's at that point that Agent LaRue strolls right by.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:31]** Looking very purposeful out of nowhere, she walks over to a Shiren.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:35]** Kelly, what does this Shiren look like?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:43]** So he is a cerulean blue Shiren Yeh, that kind of exoskeleton.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** He has red eyes.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:50]** He wears a brown trench coat and has gun holsters hidden beneath strapped to his legs.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:56]** He also has a bandolier for various devices across his chest.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** It holds useful items.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:04]** And he tops all this off with a large black space cavalier, which is kind of like a musketeer's hat.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:14]** He, if you've seen the Clone Wars, looks sort of like the bug version of Cad Bane and has a similar sort of gaze.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** Nice.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:16]** Yeah.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:17]** I gotta google that.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** Oh, sorry.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Hell yeah.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:19]** That's fine.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** Please do.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** That's so cool.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** So cool.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:25]** Cad Bane, yeah, Cad Bane is awesome.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** Oh, I know who that is.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Yeah okay.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:30]** Yeah.


## Will Garrett

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:30]** Yeeess.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** But he's got four arms, you said?


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** Oh, gosh.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** He has four arms.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:37]** So long, Jedi.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:40]** Yes, exactly.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:44]** On my bandolier, I have a chance cube.


## Nicholas Belcher 

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:50]** I just so happen to have a chance cube here.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:55]** Red is the blue is the boy.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:59]** Red is mother.


## Will Garrett

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:06]** I'm sorry, Disney.


## Cast, et al.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** _(laughter)_


## Jon Swan

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:10]** I don't think Disney owns Star Wars at that time, but now they do, I guess.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:13]** so if you had to cast somebody as you're sharing besides who would you cast?


## Kelly Gilliam
**[00:20:10 - 00:20:13]** Like an actual human I guess like the closest like maybe if he was a human he would maybe look like a nowadays Matthew McConaughey


## Kevin Decker

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:32]** Is he voiced by Matthew McConaughey?


## Will Garrett

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:33]** Fair, fair.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:37]** That would be so difficult to sustain over the long run.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:42]** Hey, everybody.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** Hey, what's up?

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:43]** I'm Matthew.


## Will Garrett

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:45]** I didn't always drive a Linton.


## Jon Swan

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:47]** Time is a flat circle.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:49]** They call me that kind of lawyer.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** Time is a flat circle?

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** I don't remember that reference.


## Will Garrett

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** True detective.


## Jon Swan

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:55]** Yeah.


## Will Garrett

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** True Detective is best.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:09]** To be honest, I haven't seen enough of Matthew McConaughey to know, but he looks like he could be a bug in another life, so that's why I chose him.


## Cast, et al.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** _(laughter)_


## Jon Swan

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:09]** That's so good.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** Oh, my gosh.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** Good afternoon.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:18]** Just a couple questions for you before you go on your way.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** What is your name?


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** Name is Heerz.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** Sorry, here's... Here's.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** Heerz.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:28]** Heerz? Pleasure.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:33]** What is your purpose for traveling to Absalom Station?


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:37]** Ah, meeting up with an old, old friend.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:42]** Well, old friends are best, they say.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:48]** And could you please explain your whereabouts in the past 24 hours?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:56]** That same hours, hours, hours, hours, as you think back.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:15]** Navigating his way around the bustling activity, his honeycomb-like eyes scan the legacy station docking bays for the familiar face of perhaps his only remaining friend among the free captains.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:23]** After some time, he sees four arms energetically waving at him from behind a ship in a busy area.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:34]** His Shiren and mandibles jitter in glee as he strides over to his old compatriot, a Kasathan named Rolu.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:41]** Hidden from the prying eyes of others on the platform, Rolu greets his four-armed friend.


## Jon Swan (Rolu)

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** Long time no see, Heerz.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** Rolu, old pal.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** It's been so long.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:52]** You are a true friend to come out and do this for me.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:55]** I was worried.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:01]** Heerz pauses as if what he is going to say, if said, might become real.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** He collects himself.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:07]** Worried that you wouldn't come.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:10]** Worried that you would be like all the others.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:14]** His words trail off with a tinge of sadness.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:23]** Rolu smiles and embraces his ears, throwing his left two arms, made strong with years of a hard life around his frame.


## Jon Swan (Rolu)

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:27]** I would never leave you alone out there, all alone, pal.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:34]** The two proceed to exchange pleasantries, briefly catching up on the past several months they've been apart.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:38]** After a jovial reunion, Rolu gets right to it,


## Jon Swan (Rolu)

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** You upset the High Captain's Heerz.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** Many want you dead.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:50]** The ones that don't aren't keen to stick their necks out to help you.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:53]** Here's Nod's expecting such news.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:55]** I can't say I blame him.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** But I did what I had to do, Rolu.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** I couldn't just let that happen.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** Not after where I've come from.


## Jon Swan (Rolu)

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:05]** I know, brother.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:08]** And I wish we could make the others understand.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:15]** I do, however, have something that may help you.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:26]** The Kasathan reaches into a puffy coat and pulls out a puck-like disc, large enough to fit a small parcel, but just small enough to fit in his hand.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:34]** Heerz turns his attention to the disc, his mandibles curiously rubbing together, before looking up at his friend questioningly.


## Jon Swan (Rolu)

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:39]** This is your only ticket back, Heerz.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:43]** Rolu warns, Heerz reaches out gingerly with an insectoid hand.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:48]** Rolu places the disc there with one hand.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:50]** Another, folding Hears' two fingers over it.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:56]** Heerz grins gratefully and can't help but whisper in a voice of hushed awe.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** Thank you.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:02]** The Kasathan returns the grin with a genial smile.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** Heerz readies questions about the disc.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** Questions like


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** What is it? How will this help me?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:18]** However, just as he begins to utter the first word, he instinctively stops himself.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** His senses are on fire.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:21]** Something's not right.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** An expression?

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:25]** No, a micro-expression.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:39]** In that split second he studies his friend's face, the Kasathan's smile fades slowly, his mouth briefly opening in a position of confusion before rapidly transforming into a grimace of cold dread.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:45]** The silenced but unmistakable sound of a fired plasma bolt is heard.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:50]** Heerz cocks his head to look past the face of his friend.

**[00:25:50 - 00:26:03]** A rise of faint smoke wafts up from behind Rolu, whose body starts to collapse with a pain grown from his throat as he falls onto Heerz's comparatively slender form.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:16]** Heerz catches him and instinctively begins to drop down on one knee, gently cradling the now weakening body of his friend, its strength fading and the body relaxing in his arms.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:20]** Rolu's eyes grow expressionless, and his breath stops.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:34]** Focusing now on the source of the blast, Heerz head shoots up to see a human male blaster held up, the last bit of smoky discharge drifting off of its barrel.


## Jon Swan (Unknown)

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** Hello, Heerz.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** Don't do anything stupid.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:51]** You're worth a lot to thy captains, and I'd like to bring you back in alive and warm, as warm as your traitor Shiren blood can be.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:56]** Heerz meets the threat with an expression of defiance and anger.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** You really shouldn't have done that.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:03]** The anger bubbles up at Heerz's voice.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** You're lucky I don't have it with me.


## Jon Swan (Unknown)

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:09]** Get up and walk over slowly.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:16]** Heerz his mind begins to race, playing over as many permutations of means of escape as he can.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** The man's voice rises.


## Jon Swan (Unknown)

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** Let's go, Hears!

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** I'm not asking again!


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** The man's voice shouts louder than before.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:27]** The Shiren strikes on an idea.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** It will work.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:35]** Yes, all he needs is a final act of help from his friend and a gentle request to his adversary.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:48]** One of his hands being out of sight behind Rolu's body, he slowly reaches into his bandolier and continues to meet the threatening gaze of his assailant and triggers the timer.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:52]** I'll come with you, but first... 


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:59]** He pauses, the next words falling from his mouth audibly but gingerly.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:03]** I really wish you would drop that gun.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:14]** Heerz looks down at the ground and takes off his cavalier, seemingly in a sign of respect for his dead friend and an admission of his defeat.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:18]** He rests the hat on his chest as he mentally counts down.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:20]** Eighteen.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:23]** Seventeen.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:36]** The human bursts into loud laughter, adheres his words and display his guffaws echo off the side of the ship next to him for a few moments before fading into a gleeful, intermittent chuckles.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** He walks forward.


## Jon Swan (Unknown)

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:43]** I had heard you had a flair for the dramatic, 


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:45]** He says joyfully as he jaunts.


## Jon Swan (Unknown)

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** Come, come now.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** We don't.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:59]** The man stops moving at once and violently bends backwards as if being restrained by an invisible other.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:04]** He audibly chokes, trying to mouth words that won't come.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:09]** His eyes bug out as he raises two trembling hands in front of them.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:12]** With all his might, he tries to focus on his hands.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:17]** And at last, when he does, his eyes widen further as his shocks escalate.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:34]** deepen shock deepens he stares in horror as all ten of his fingers twist obscenely in a series of small quick popping motions backwards to the back of his hands towards his wrist his screams in agony

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:43]** He screams in agony as the snapping becomes more grotesque and his palms and digits both become smaller and more twisted.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:49]** His blaster drops, unable to stay tucked in his changing palm.

**[00:29:49 - 00:30:04]** Smooth olive skin transitions into cobalt blue and broken fingers now twine together in a vine-like motion until nothing but a singular, long, exoskeletal extremity remains at the end of each of

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** His arms.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:06]** Eight.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** Seven.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:09]** Six.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:18]** Pools of tears brought on by pain welled up in his eyes now fall down his cheeks as he writes his head and turns to look at Hears incredulously.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:22]** In a pained breath, he wheezes as loud as possible.


## Jon Swan (Unknown)

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:26]** What did you do to me?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:30]** Heerz smiles a wan grin.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** I think it suits you, asshole!


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:44]** _(laugher)_ Holy crap.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** Three, Two.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:49]** Heerz lifts the cavalier to his face and shuts his eyes.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:49]** One.

**[00:30:54 - 00:31:01]** The flashbang's charge shoots up vertically about a meter into the air before exploding into pure blinding light.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:05]** The human pirate yelps and raises his arms too late.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** Everything becomes a blanket of white.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** His ears ring.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:13]** In an instant, Heerz returns the cavalier to his head and bolts.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:21]** Knowing that the flashbang definitely made enough noise to draw the attention of the platform, he knows that there's nothing to do but run.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:33]** Among the noise and activity, he hears his insectoid legs carry him across the platform and further into the station, running down corridors, looking for somewhere, anywhere quiet to hide.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:40]** Ignoring the onlookers, he weaves through corridor after corridor, looking for those least populated.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:47]** Crowded halls get sparser and sparser until at last he can tuck away out of sight into the dark.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:50]** He takes a moment to relax and gather his wits.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:59]** Then he reaches into his duster and pulls out the disc Rolu died to give him.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:03]** He pauses, reflecting sadly for a moment, then opens it.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:05]** There's a note inside.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** Heerz, reads aloud.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:12]** Heerz... This contains information on something highly coveted by the High Captains.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** It will be dangerous to obtain.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:20]** But if you are successful, you can name your price.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:23]** Then you can finally come back.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:26]** I'll be waiting for your return.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:29]** Godspeed, friend.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:37]** Heerz gingerly removes the note, revealing the package underneath.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:44]** As he peels it away, a bright blue glow reflects off of his eyes.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:46]** Wow.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:50]** That was a really cool story.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** That was freaking dope.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** Cheers!


## Kevin Decker

**[00:32:54 - 00:33:01]** It's hard to take you guys serious, though, because every time I look at Kelly talking, which you sound phenomenal, and then I see Chewie shaking his head in the background.


## Jon Swan

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:16]** It's worth mentioning that this podcast was supposed to be recorded in person, but due to extenuating circumstances, we are currently recording remotely, so we're all on Zoom, and they're a great Star Wars Zoom.

## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:21]** No, when we gather in person, I'm going to hire someone to wear a Chewie suit and sit next to me.


## Cast, et al.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:25]** _(laughter)_


## Jon Swan

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** That's so good.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** Can we all pitch in and make that a reality?


## Will Garrett

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:33]** We just have to find somebody on the walk of fame.


## Jon Swan

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** But they have to be really quiet because we'll be recording.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** So they have to be moving but very quiet.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:40]** Like, shh.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** That's true.


## Will Garrett

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:45]** And every time we point at him, he has to actually let out. (Chewbaca noises)


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** We'll be like, we know.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** We know.

## Cast, et al.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:49]** _(Chewbaca noises)_


## Jon Swan

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:51]** We know, Chewy, we know.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** Sorry, Disney.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Please don't sue us.


## Will Garrett

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** I'm not sorry.


## Jon Swan

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:59]** This is the third copyright infringement of your first podcast episode.


## Will Garrett

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:03]** We're not even using... It's parody.

## Jon Swan

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** It's fine. It's all good.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:09]** Were you with your friend in the past 24 hours?


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:11]** Oh, yes.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:13]** Oh, all right.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** Anything in particular that you two were up to?

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:21]** I hate to be specific, but it is necessary.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:29]** Well, we just caught up on old times and I gave him some nice coffee that I found and kind of drank it and...

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** That was all.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:30]** Get me out of here.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:33]** I understand your frustration.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:35]** Again, I'm doing my best here.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:40]** Just a few more people that we need to talk to, and then I guarantee you can be on your way.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:43]** Please, please just be patient and wait.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** We have new friends here with these people.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** Oh, all right.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:55]** She walks back, a little miffed, writes some things down, probably like, he's an asshole.


## Cast, et al.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:56]** Yeah.


## Will Garrett

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:01]** That's literally all they write down.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:05]** What grade asshole are you?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:09]** And then she turns, looks at the remaining people.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:15]** She walks over to a slug person.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** That's offensive.


## Will Garrett

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** How dare you?


## Jon Swan

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:24]** Some people call them Osharus, but Will, what does this Osharu look like?


## Will Garrett

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:31]** He's a, you know, well-dressed sort of professional slug.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:37]** You know, his skin is like an oily...

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:43]** ultramarine and azure with like hints of coral and magenta sort of bioluminescence 


## Kelly Gilliam
**[00:35:37 - 00:35:43]** That's beautiful 


## Jon Swan

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:43]** Yeah that sounds like you just read the colors off a crayon box


## Will Garrett

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:43]** He's got like a lot of like you know tentacle like phalanges and things popping off of his face and he's very astute he stands up straight but also he's very stoic and reserved

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:05]** Played probably by, like, an Alan Rickman.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** The late Alan Rickman.


## Cast, et al.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:09]** I would love that.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** Wow.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:10]** So much.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** Beautiful choice.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** Great choice.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** A professional slug.


## Will Garrett

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:19]** Yes, I know my... Yeah, professional slug.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:24]** Are we talking, like, 80s Alan Rickman or, like, Harry Potter Alan Rickman?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** Like, diehard Alan Rickman or Harry Potter?


## Will Garrett

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** Yeah, no, I'm trying to think, like...

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:33]** I would say more Harry Potter, but not so Harry Potter.


## Jon Swan

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:37]** More Harry Potter, but not so Harry Potter.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:37]** I like it.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:39]** Just a hint of Harry Potter.


## Jon Swan

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** Just a dash.


## Will Garrett

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:44]** Like, almost like Galaxy Quest.


## Cast, et al.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** Oh, my God.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:47]** Oh, please do that.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** That is a throwback.


## Jon Swan

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** What a classic movie.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** I love that movie.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** One of his better roles, for sure.


## Jon Swan

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** Yeah.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** That was so perfect.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:59]** I'm definitely going to watch that movie this weekend now.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** Have you never seen it?


## Jon Swan

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:01]** Oh, I love it.


## Will Garrett

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Oh, it's so good.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** It's so good.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** How about we just do a group viewing?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:07]** Let's just stop recording the podcast.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** We'll just watch it all right now.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** We'll just do it.


## Will Garrett

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** What are we even playing Starfinder for?


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** Hello.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** What is your name?


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:23]** My name is Dr. Kontu Okkatus.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:26]** Dr. Okkatus.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Yes!

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:30]** I love these voices!


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** I'm sorry.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** Whatever do you mean?


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:39]** I'm sorry, I didn't say anything else.


## Will Garrett

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** No.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** My mistake.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:49]** He sounds like the caterpillar from, like, uh... I'm sorry.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:53]** What is your purpose for traveling to Absalom Station?


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:58]** I'm going to catch up with some colleagues within the university system.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:02]** I'm a doctor, a research doctor.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:09]** It is interesting to see Osharu's by themselves.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** They typically travel together.


**[00:38:12 - 00:38:16]** I hope there's not a great need.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:19]** I hope everything is all right.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** It's curious.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:24]** Yes, I see that as well.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:32]** Yes, it is curious, however, at this time, necessary.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:42]** I see that you've recently made yourself familiar with the local authorities.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:47]** They can be a bothersome lot, no matter, no matter.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** I see.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:59]** But I do have to ask, as I've asked everyone here, could you please explain your whereabouts in the past 24 hours?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** 24 hours.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** 24 hours.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:11]** We're inside a dark, musty, dimly lit room.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:14]** Cold steel walls.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:19]** two metal chairs surrounding a simple metal table.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:28]** The small light overhead barely reaches the corners of the Legacy Station precinct interrogation room.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:33]** One human man sits across from an Osharu.


## Jon Swan (Officier Leeroy)

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:53]** Let me see here, uh, Kuntuo Otanamus, uh, tell me what brings you to Legacy Station exactly, because I'm having a hard time understanding why someone like you would come here alone and cause trouble on my station.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:59]** Um, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:03]** I believe there's been a misunderstanding as I told your deputies.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:08]** I'm searching for my colleague who I believe was here recently because... 


## Jon Swan (Sergeant Leeroy)

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:08]** Speak up! Speak up!

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:12]** And answer the question, Cuntu, I don't have all day.


## Will Garrett

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:21]** It's pronounced Kontu, Kontu Okkatus, and it's a doctor, if you don't mind, but you may call me Dr. OK, if you prefer.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:30]** I'm here because my colleague and some of our medical trade goods came to your station and both have seemed to have gone missing.


## Jon Swan (Sergeant Leeroy)

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:33]** Oh, excuse me.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** Yes, I see Dr. K.O.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** Kung Fu.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** My mistake.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:41]** Tell me, what sort of trade goods are we talking about?

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** Trading with who, exactly?

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:47]** What are you trying to achieve by coming here to my station?


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:56]** Myself and my colleagues, we trade with Legacy through very many pharmaceutical dealers.


## Jon Swan (Sergeant Leeroy)

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:59]** Drug dealers, you mean, obviously.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:20]** As I have stated repeatedly to you and your deputies, I can't speak to any illicit activities per se, but the attention to quality when it comes to medicine and chemical components that can be formulated... 


## Jon Swan (Sergeant Leeroy)

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:26]** Formulated to make narcotics like the drugs that I see every day in the corridors of this station and on 24-hour Starhammer or Crush Casbah, I see Dr. Kontu, okay?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:42]** Sergeant Leroy pours out salt from his salt seeker without caution onto the table before Dr. OK's eyes and then slams the bottle menacingly on the table.


## Jon Swan (Sergeant Leeroy)

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** I get it.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:48]** You come here to make some quick bucks, turning good station folks into addicts?

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:53]** Are you going to talk about the drugs you've brought here to poison this station?

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:58]** Or am I going to have to get saltier with my line of questioning?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:04]** Sergeant Leeroy stares menacingly, attempting to lock eyes with Dr. O.K.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:13]** as he licks the end of the salt shaker, his saliva dripping from his tongue as he gazes at Dr. O.K.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** to try and break his resolve.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:26]** Dr. O.K.'s glassy black eyes stare into the vapid, sinister eyes of Sergeant Leeroy before him.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** as he begins to remember.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:47]** Dr. Kontu Okkatus stands beside several crates of pharmacy-grade chemicals with two research assistants on a marshy clearing in the outer reaches outside the crystal shield of Javon.

**[00:42:48 - 00:43:03]** With them pacing in front of the crates walks Dr. O.K.'s advisor, mentor, and research partner, Dr. Ajijone Boujdakis, who paces nervously, muttering to himself.


## Jon Swan (Dr. Ajijone Boujdakis)

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:04]** They'll be here.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Oh, I'm sure of it, They'll be here.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** Whatever do you mean, Doctor?

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:12]** We've traded with these men before, haven't we?


## Jon Swan (Dr. Ajijone Boujdakis)

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:15]** Yes, yes, we've traded before, but...

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:23]** This time, this time, listen, whatever happens here, you must continue our research.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:28]** It's not merely for you and I, but all of us.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:32]** And I don't need to tell you how important it is.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:36]** Listen, they have research we need.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:45]** And there may, well, they may need me to help them unload on their vessel alone.


## Will Garrett

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:46]** Wait.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** What?

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** You can't leave by yourself.


## Jon Swan (Dr. Ajijone Boujdakis)

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:52]** Listen, it's too important to argue.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:58]** Not just for us, you see, but for all of us.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:01]** Yes, I know, Doctor.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:07]** We wouldn't be meeting here with outsiders if it wasn't critical, but you can't just leave alone.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:09]** Wait, is that them?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:13]** A small shuttlecraft peeks over the jungle horizon.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:23]** Its thrusters disrupt plant and wildlife, shaking the ground as the craft makes a seemingly abrupt and hasty landing onto the clearing.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:34]** Almost as immediately as the craft lands, a figure appears through the clouds of exhaust, discharging from the thickly shrouded loading bay.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:38]** He speaks loudly over the hum of the partially shut down engines.


## Jon Swan (Unknown)

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** Dr. Boujdakis, come with us!

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Bring your cargo, hurry!


## Jon Swan (Dr. Ajijone Boujdakis)

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:46]** I must go, Kontu.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:52]** Dr. Boustakis signals to the research students now cowering behind the crates.


## Jon Swan (Dr. Ajijone Boujdakis)

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:56]** Load those goods immediately or I'll reject your dissertations.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:03]** Dr. Boujdakis winks sheepishly at Dr. Okkatas and goes to turn towards the craft.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:08]** Wait! 


## Jon Swan (Dr. Ajijone Boujdakis)

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** Dr. Ok will be okay. I must see this through.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** Let me go with you, though.


## Jon Swan (Dr. Ajijone Boujdakis)

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** No, I can't.


## Jon Swan (Unknown)

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** That's not the deal.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** Hurry!


## Jon Swan (Dr. Ajijone Boujdakis)

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** Listen, Kontu, I'll be back with something.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:23]** It's... It's going to change everything.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:25]** Wait.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** No. You mustn't go without... 


## Jon Swan (Dr. Ajijone Boujdakis)

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:30]** Listen, Kontu. Remember.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:35]** Dr. Boujdakis grabs Kontu's hands firmly, stares into his eyes, and says, 


## Jon Swan (Dr. Ajijone Boujdakis)

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:41]** We are stronger than our skin...

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:45]** We must be strong for our kin...


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:55]** Dr. Boujdakis faintly smiles and turns away towards the shuttlecraft, disappearing into the hazy cloud of engine exhaust.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:02]** We are stronger than our skin...


## Jon Swan (Sergeant Leeroy)

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** What's that?


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:08]** We must be strong for a kin...


## Jon Swan (Sergeant Leeroy)

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** All right, Slimeball.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** Time to get salty.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:15]** The sergeant grabs Dr. Okkatus' arm, salt in hand.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:19]** Suddenly, Kontu grabs the sergeant's face with his tentacles.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:34]** Jarring the sarge, Dr. Okkatus calmly grabs a syringe hidden beneath a flap of skin near his shoulders, his oily, semi-luminous skin glowing with intensity and vibrating vigorously.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:40]** He forces the sergeant's face closer to him, positioning his gaze upwards to the ceiling.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:44]** Dr. OK moves in closer to whisper into the sergeant's ear.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** No, I'm O.K.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:46:48 - 00:47:03]** Without a sound or hesitation, a greasy tentacle injects the sergeant directly into the pupil of his eyeball with absolute precision and retracts away, leaving the sergeant locked in a gaze with the ceiling above.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:06]** That's better, Sergeant, wouldn't you agree?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:16]** Dr. Okkatas' neurotoxin quickly takes hold of the sergeant as his posture becomes more relaxed and appears to become befuddled and docile.


## Jon Swan (Sergeant Leeroy)

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:22]** Yes, uh, yeah, I'm starting to feel more okay, Dr. OK.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:23]** Splendid.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:26]** Let's talk about my colleague.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** Where did he go?

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:31]** What was he here for, to your recollection?


## Jon Swan (Sergeant Leeroy)

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:33]** We don't know what brought him here.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:45]** Only that he and his friends left in a hurry because he left only what we can assume to be some personal effects in this bag that was left behind.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Puts a bag on the table.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:49]** Oh, I see, Sergeant.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** That's quite fascinating.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** May I take a look?


## Jon Swan (Sergeant Leeroy)

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** Yes, yes, of course, Dr. O.K.

**[00:47:54 - 00:48:04]** We were unable to decipher or recover any information from the data pad in his bag, but with your help, Dr.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:15]** O.K., we will be able to unravel his drug network and apprehend the fugitive known as Dr. Boo Hoo Daykings and his accomplices.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:18]** Anything I can do to help, of course.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Where did you lose him?


## Jon Swan (Sergeant Leeroy)

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:27]** He was being chased by one of our undercovers into the Pack World's tunnels during a sting operation.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:37]** Our man, he lost sight of Dr. Buzdaking shortly after the security cameras were mysteriously blacked out on our security feed.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:45]** Dr. O.K. stands from the table with the bag as the bewildered sergeant begins staring deeply at the ceiling above.


## Jon Swan (Sergeant Leeroy)

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** Oh, we are going to find him, you see.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** You'll all see, do you?

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** Do you see?

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:53]** Do you see the colors on the ceiling?

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** And these lights?


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:57]** Yes, they're fascinating, Sergeant.

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:01]** Truly, say, am I free to leave?


## Jon Swan (Sergeant Leeroy)

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:03]** Yes, yes, of course, you're free to go.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:08]** And, you know, I didn't notice before, but the ceiling reminds me of your eyes.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** Really shiny, really, really shiny.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** It's incredible.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:20]** Dr. OK opens the door slightly to the low roar of Legacy Police Station's bullpen.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:21]** I'm sorry.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:24]** I could barely hear you, Sergeant.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** Could you speak up?

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:28]** It's hard to hear over the sound of the ceiling.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** Do you hear it, too?


## Jon Swan (Sergeant Leeroy)

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** Yes!

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** Oh, my!

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** Yes, you are free.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:34]** Free to go, Dr. Okinawas.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** Thank you for all your help.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:38]** Thank you for coming in.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** Yes, take care.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:39]** Hmm.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:42]** Thank you, Sergeant.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** Don't mention it.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:50]** And be sure to drink plenty of water once the ceiling is done talking about how shiny it is.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:49:50 - 00:50:04]** Dr. Okkatus leaves the interrogation room, casually closes the door, begins walking out of the police station, nodding to his arresting deputies, and heads out to the main concourse on Legacy Station.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:12]** Inside the Terminus of Legacy Station, a trepidatious Dr. O.K.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:17]** enters the terminal for vessels traveling to the Pactworlds.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:25]** Dr. O.K. cautiously makes his way through the crowd, avoiding detection by the security personnel stationed throughout the terminal.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:28]** The crowd, moving at a hurried pace, avoids Dr.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:35]** O.K., who stands stoically as he looks back up at the terminal platform, but reads,

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:40]** Now boarding Absalom's station.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:49]** And he gazes back into the bag of Dr. Bousdakis' belongings and speaks quietly to himself as he begins to move forward towards the gate.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:54]** I am stronger than my skin.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:59]** I will be strong for my kin.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** Blackout.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:11]** Why am I not surprised, Will, that you are the first person to drug somebody in both our D&D game and our Starfinder game.


## Jon Swan

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** I don't know what you're talking about, Paizo.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:18]** We don't play Dungeons & Dragons.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** That never happens.


## Will Garrett

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** Whatever are you talking about?

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:21]** What is that?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:24]** The banter between those two characters was amazing.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:27]** The sergeant and the doctor.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:29]** It really was.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** And again, your voice is phenomenal.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** Yeah, it's so good.


## Jon Swan

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:33]** The voice was phenomenal.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** It's fantastic.


## Will Garrett (as Dr. OK)

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** Thank you.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:53]** so good I love that I am stronger than my skin I'll be stronger than my for my kin that's like such a cool thing I think it's really cool 

## Will Garrett

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:39]** slugs have weak skin man 


## Kevin Decker

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:43]** I think it's creepy actually but whatever I thought 


## Will Garrett

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:43]** it was supposed to be all those things that's so funny


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:59]** Could you please explain your whereabouts in the past 24 hours?


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:10]** Yes, I was in the station meeting, gathering some belongings and personal effects for my trip to Absalom.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** Hmm.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** All right.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Well, that's fine.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** That's fine.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:13]** Yes, yes, yes.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** No problem.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** I'm sorry.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:15]** I'm sorry.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** Don't mean to pry.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** She takes a few steps back.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:19]** Pauses.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:24]** Looks up at the Kasathan.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** Looks up at Rick.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** Looks up at Hears.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** Looks up at Dr. O.K.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:33]** Thinks.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:40]** And turns to finally look at a man.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:46]** Nick, what does this young man look like?


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** He's a younger man.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:51]** He's kind of, I would say, in his mid-20s, like 26, 27.

**[00:52:53 - 00:53:01]** beginnings of a five o'clock shadow, but he's wearing a white button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up halfway up his forearms.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:09]** And his gray pants, he's wearing gray slacks as well with a belt and black shoes.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:16]** But everything kind of looks like he's been rolling around on concrete and cement.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:20]** And there's splotches of green blood on his shirt.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:31]** So the person who I would play to act, the person who I'd cast to act him would be the guy who played Solo in the Solo movie.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** Han Solo in the Solo movie.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:37]** I think his name is Alden Aaron Rich.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:37]** Nice.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:44]** So what you're saying is that we have two versions of Harrison Ford who are in this game.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** That's awesome.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** Completely unplanned.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** Not planned at all.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** Hello, excuse me.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** What is your name?


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** Why do you need to know?

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** No, it's quite all right.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:05]** It's not a problem.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:15]** We are... I am here as part of some steward's business, and we have some information, and we are simply...

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:19]** making sure that everything checks out.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** That is it.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:25]** So it's, again, I've asked some of your fellow passengers here.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:28]** It really is just a few questions about your name.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:32]** There's nothing personal about it whatsoever.


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** I'm sorry.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** It's just been a day.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:36]** I understand.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** It's almost over.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** I guarantee you can get on board soon.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** It's quite easy.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:46]** I also would like to move on with my day, right?

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:52]** No, I do have to ask you again, so we can move over this together.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** What is your name?


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** Niko.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Niko Orion.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** All right, Niko.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:03]** Well, again, my name is LaRue.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:07]** L-A-R-U-E, in case you forgot.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:12]** So, what's your purpose for traveling to Absalom Station?


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** Travel.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:16]** Traveling to travel.


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** Yes.


## Will Garrett

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** Business or leisure.?


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:24]** Do you care to explain any more?


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** Just travel.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** Indeed, just travel.


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:33]** I just thought I might catch a little bit of the starlight.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:38]** She writes a little longer than you would have thought.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:47]** And could you please explain your whereabouts in the past 24 hours?

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:48]** Hours.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:49]** Hours.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:52]** Hours.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:55]** Hours.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** The black screen.

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:04]** A throng of voices starts soft and quickly escalates in volume.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:12]** as suddenly we see lobby doors swing open and two individuals, one human and one Vesk, storm out.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:22]** Their fast pace is slowed by the press and reporters waiting outside the tall building, shouting questions, flashing their holocams.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:30]** The Vesk naturally steps ahead, clearly at a leading bodyguard's distance, trying to part the crowd to their sky limo.


## Jon Swan (Unknown Reporter 1)

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:35]** What is your reaction to being voted out by your own board of directors?


## Jon Swan (Unknown Reporter 2)

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:41]** Is it true that your own mother led the charge to oust you from the company?


## Jon Swan (Unknown Reporter 3)

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:46]** Did the board oust you because of your suspected illegal drug abuse?


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:48]** How could she do this?


## Jon Swan (Zentuko)

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** We need to leave.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:51]** It's not safe here.


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** Illegal drugs?

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** I never even touched the stuff.


## Jon Swan (Zentuko)

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** I don't think this is about you.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:57]** Move!

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:00]** I think this is about some of the work your father did.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:03]** Did you grab anything from your office before you left?


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:05]** No.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:08]** This is more about the work that you still can't tell me about.


## Jon Swan (Zentuko)

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** Get back, everyone!

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:12]** We need to get out of here.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:25]** A few hundred steps lay between the pair in the skyline, each step growing louder as the reporters disperse, and they finally reach the private open-air platform.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:31]** Zentuko looks around for the driver who is nowhere to be found.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:38]** Nico follows up closely behind Zentuko.


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:42]** Are you ever going to tell me about what you and my father did?

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** I think I have a right to know.


## Jon Swan (Zentuko)

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:46]** I will, but not here.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:51]** It's not safe.


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** Where's the Neb?

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:55]** He's always waiting right by the Sky Limo.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** And why isn't it safe now?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:02]** Nico sees Zentuko take out his azimuth laser pistol slowly.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:08]** After a moment of observation, Nico notices and Zentuco's eyes are drawn to the distance.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:17]** He sees a small flash and has just enough time to register the meaning before a large, vesk arm swings around him, pulling him to the ground.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:24]** Nico closes his eyes and for a brief moment feels nothing as he hears the shot fly by him.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:31]** Nico opens his eyes, his friend currently laying heavy upon him.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** Sirens began in the distance.


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:40]** Alright, you're right.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:41]** Let's get out of here.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:46]** When Zentuko doesn't respond, Niko starts to worry.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:52]** He throws Zentuko off to the side of him, face up, grabs Zentuko's shoulders and shakes him.


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** Zen!


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:58]** Niko begins to check his friend's body, confused why his friend wasn't responding.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:03]** His hands find a hole in his chest about the size of a large projectile.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:08]** Niko pulls his hand away and feels the green blood drip between his fingers.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:13]** His friend's clothes were now drenched with the last of his own blood.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:17]** Zen didn't have long, and Niko needed to get him to a trauma center.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:21]** Applying pressure to the wound, he called out...


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:24]** Help!

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:24]** I need a medic!


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:26]** Silence is the only response.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:31]** Until, as if awoken by Nico's call for help, Zentuko rouses.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:35]** Breathing erratically, he grasps Nico tightly.


## Jon Swan (Zentuko)

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:40]** Not Noah.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:40]** The picture.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:43]** The picture of you and your father.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** Find it.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:50]** Shock, concern, and resignation ward for control of Niko's thoughts.

**[00:59:51 - 01:00:00]** He wipes away his tears of worry and feels something hit his hand as Zintuko then shoves the bloodied azimuth laser pistol into it.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:09]** Unable to control himself, Niko's tears resume their former course.


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** Zen... 


## Jon Swan (Zentuko)

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** Go, Niko. Leave me.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** Make this count.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Now...


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:21]** Niko, holding his friend's pistol, stares shocked at his friend.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:25]** Niko's own inner turmoil has settled on emotion for the time being.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:31]** Zentuko's hands find Niko's shoulders with failing strength.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:37]** With a wry smile, he says, 


## Jon Swan (Zentuko)

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:37]** I guess they were right in the end.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:43]** My heart never again.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:45]** Oh...


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:58]** These were the last words Zentuko managed to gasp as his eyes became host to death's vacant stare.


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** Zen!

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:01]** Zen!

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** Zen!


## Nicholas Belcher 

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:07]** Niko cried and banged his hands against the platform.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:10]** After a few moments of despair, rage took over.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** He had to get out of here.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:15]** He had to make Zen's sacrifice count.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:18]** Niko had to make them pay.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** He sprung up into a crouch.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:26]** After surveying where the shot came from, by now the sniper was either changing position or gone.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** Now was the best chance to flee.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:33]** He slid over the hood of the Sky Limo and jumped into the driver's seat.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:40]** After a cold fire start, he piloted the Sky Limo toward the Legacy Station docking base.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:42]** He needed to get off station.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:48]** He needed to find Zen's family and to find his own.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:48]** Blackout.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** Wow.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:59]** Dude, nice brokish character.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:02]** Your guys' voice acting is so good.


## Nicholas Belcher 

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:07]** You know... I appreciate that, man.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:12]** Hey, you guys should think about recording a podcast.


## Jon Swan

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:17]** Hey, I'm just gonna say, I know that, you know, we came up with this story and all this stuff, and you killed it.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:18]** It was a great story.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:25]** But I just gotta ask, why didn't Nico just, like, go to the bathroom and just, like, wipe off some of the blood?

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:29]** Just, like, you know, just, like, dab some water and some paper towels on it?

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:30]** You know?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:33]** I mean, like, Heerz can relate to the loss of your friend, man.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** Like...

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:37]** I feel you.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** I feel you, bro.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:44]** This is going to be an interesting campaign here.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:53]** We got a shady pharmaceutical sales rep, a pirate, a murder bot, and a weapons vendor.


## Kevin Decker (RICK-19)

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:59]** I find the term murder bot inappropriate and kind of rude.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:05]** I am a pharmaceutical researcher, sir.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:08]** Technically, I'm a former pirate, so...


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:15]** It seems you all are making fast friends here.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:19]** Have a good trip, I'm sure.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:24]** So, as I said, could you please explain your whereabouts in the past 24 hours?


## Nicholas Belcher (Niko Orion)

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Um, well...

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:30]** I got, uh... I got voted out of my own company.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:34]** I've, uh... Voted out of my own company.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:48]** Had my... My closest friend and a father... Got down before my eyes and... I made a desperate getaway in a, uh, sky... How's about... How about that for... How about we just call that a day on my whearabouts?


## John Swan (Agent Larue)

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:51]** Well, I can say that I can't relate to any of that.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:55]** But, uh... I do understand tough days...


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:57]** What's a Skylimo look like?


## Nicholas Belcher

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:10]** Well, it looks like one of those air speeders in Attack of the Clones that we were talking about before we started recording the podcast, but just, like, longer.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** Is it open air?


## Nicholas Belcher

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:13]** It is open air, actually.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:14]** Nice.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:14]** I like that.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:17]** With the capacity of being closed to the air.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** It's, like, convertible.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:20]** But did you get away in the open air?


## Nicholas Belcher

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:24]** Yeah, it's convertible Skylimbo air.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:26]** Well, I understand.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:32]** She kind of writes down a few things in her datapad again.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:33]** Have a good trip.


**[01:04:33 - 01:04:38]** I hope the rest of your days are happier than today.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:41]** I hope this will be the worst of them all.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:44]** Perfect.


## Will Garrett

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** That seems super likely.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:46]** Yes.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:49]** For an adventure path, that seems super likely.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:53]** She takes a step back, counting in her head, looking again.

**[01:04:55 - 01:05:01]** and turns to look at the one last individual.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:10]** She walks over to an older man dressed in fashionable station wear, the last passenger in this group.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:16]** His gray beard and hair matched cut perfectly.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:22]** They're matched by metallic gray cybernetic augmentations around his neck.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:28]** I would like all of you to give me a perception check.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:31]** Ho ho!

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:34]** First roll!


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:35]** This is it.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** This is the first roll.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:39]** Kevin, I don't see you moving.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:40]** Did you forget your dice?

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:42]** Did you forget your dice?

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:43]** Perception.


## Kevin Decker

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** I was going to do digital.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:44]** Is that okay?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:49]** How dare you not let us hear the physical roll.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:50]** All right.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:52]** We're going to go around and say what we did.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:55]** I'm going to start with the top left in my Zoom screen here.

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:57]** That's you, Kelly.

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:57]** What'd you get?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:03]** I am going to be doing that.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:05]** Okay.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:07]** We're going to move on.


## Jon Swan

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:07]** Will, What did you get?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_Kelly Gilliam2

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:10]** I'm logging in.


## Will Garrett

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:16]** I rolled a 16 plus my perception modifier, so 19.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]** 19, okay.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:21]** Nick slash Niko, what'd you get?


## Nicholas Belcher

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:23]** I got a 13.


## Jon Swan

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:25]** 13. Respectable

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:29]** What about you, old Ricky?


## Kevin Decker

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:35]** So Rick's got a plus 4 for perception, so I'm a 5.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** A 5...

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:40]** So let me just back-calculate this for you real quick.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:41]** So you got a 1.


## Kevin Decker

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:42]** Yeah, I rolled a 1.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:44]** All right, cool.

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:50]** You're still checking your device to make sure you're in the right docking bay.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:52]** You're like, I don't... I just want to check.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** Kelly, what did you get?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:56]** All right, I got... Oh, wow.

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:57]** I got a one.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:59]** Oh!

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:01]** You guys are fucking off strong.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:01]** Hey!

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:04]** Is this docking bay 18?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:06]** Yeah.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:07]** Where am I?


## Kevin Decker

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:16]** The Kasathan and the android are just, like, staring at each other going, like, I don't know.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:16]** I don't know.

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:18]** I don't know.

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:30]** So, as Special Agent LaRue is talking to this older man, you all, I would say, Nico and Dr. Okkatas

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:38]** You hear off to the right, up towards the entrance of the ship.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:41]** You kind of turn and look as you're waiting.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:53]** You see Algiada Ijonne, the chief security officer of the Chimera, speaking with the Vesk that was dismissed in the beginning.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:54]** It's very genial.

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:56]** She's got a smile on her face.

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:57]** It's just a couple of words.

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:59]** Maybe you just hear like, yeah.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:02]** That's it.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:05]** And then the Vesk walks in.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:19]** The Kasathan, next to Rick, turns over and actually turns towards Dr. Okkatus and Nico and hears, Have you all seen anything like this?


## Jon Swan (Kasathan)

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:23]** I asked Rick, I believe Rick 19.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:26]** I asked Rick if you all had.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:28]** This is quite a...

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:31]** I'm a little impatient.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:34]** It's quite annoying.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:36]** Have any of you seen anything like this before?


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:38]** What exactly am I looking at?


## Jon Swan (Kasathan)

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:41]** No, just the situation.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:45]** Just being held up as you're about to board your ship, it seems.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:48]** distracting, annoying.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:54]** I did not pay to have to wait here.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:55]** Be impositioned.


## Kelly Gilliam (Heerz)

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:56]** I totally agree.


## Jon Swan (Kasathan)

**[01:08:56 - 01:09:07]** I just have to ask, have you been in the situation before where you've had to wait and be inconvenienced by someone like this?


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:13]** As an Asharu, we often are...

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:16]** patient with the world.


## Jon Swan (Kasathan)

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:18]** Well, that is a good trait to have.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:21]** Not all Kasathans are like that.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:23]** If only they could be that way.

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:27]** Well, it is a pleasure to meet you then.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:29]** I apologize.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:30]** I just wanted to make friends.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:32]** That's it.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:33]** Would you like something to relax?


## Jon Swan (Kasathan)

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:38]** I'm sure it's alright.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:41]** I'm sure on the ship it'll be alright.


## Will Garrett (Dr. OK)

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:43]** No problem.

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:43]** I thought I'd offer?


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:46]** Thank you all for your patience.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:47]** You five.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:50]** Agent LaRue walks back to the center.

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:52]** She points at the four of you.

**[01:09:54 - 01:09:59]** Rick hears Dr. OK, Nico, and the older man.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:02]** You are welcome to board.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:10:03 - 01:10:05]** She turns to the Kasathan woman.


## Jon Swan (Agent Larue)

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:11]** I've spoken with the security chief up here, Iom.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:12]** That's I-O-M.

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:16]** And I'd like to ask you a few questions.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:19]** Perhaps we could take a walk?

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:31]** The stewards are willing to recommend you rebook your trip back to Absalom Station for a later date.


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:10:32 - 01:10:43]** As Agent LaRue and the Kasathan are starting to talk, at that moment, to your right, the doors to the Chimera slide open, and we hear, 


## Jon Swan (Captain)

**[01:10:32 - 01:10:43]** Would someone here care to tell me what's holding up my passengers?


## Jon Swan (GM)

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:54]** Followed by a grunt.

**[01:10:54 - 01:11:11]** Turning back, you see, as if in slow motion, the Kasathan woman's arms extended, pushing forward, Inspector LaRue flying through the air before falling backwards to the ground with a thud.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:20]** The other two Kasathan arms are pulling out a knife in their hand, and that's game over.

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:31]** This is the end of episode one, but I want to be the first to welcome you to The Willing.

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:34]** It's your introductory GM, John Swan.

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:44]** We hope you enjoy the very, very beginning of our adventure, the swan dive, if you will, into the world of conspiracies and covert machinations.
