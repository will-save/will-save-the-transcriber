**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Last time on Will Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:08]** Questioning ensued after the group took two hostile pirates hostage.

**[00:00:09 - 00:00:17]** Hears asks the captured pirate god Weena about their connection when she reveals that Hears killed her whole family.

**[00:00:18 - 00:00:23]** The mood changes though when a cry for help is heard over the pirates' comms.

**[00:00:24 - 00:00:36]** Dragging their prisoner, they investigate the pirate's distress call and discover a shapeshifter with the likeness of Lozu standing over the body of first mate Lozu.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:42]** The group is further confused when the shapeshifter splits himself into five different clones.

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:45]** How will the characters find the real imposter?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:48]** can you all remember the first time you rolled some math rocks and you were like, cool, let's play.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** I think, I think we've talked about this before.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:59]** We talked about, I mean, I have, we talked about the first time that we played, you know, any sort of tabletop game, right?

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Certainly Dungeons and Dragons, Starfinder.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:08]** But what I'm, what I'm really getting at here is if you were to take that and

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** Looking back now, where you are now.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:11]** This is episode 25.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:16]** I don't know what that means in terms of your ability to know a game and be an expert.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** Are you ever an expert at a game?

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** I don't know.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:25]** But if you could look back at yourself now, either starting Starfinder or starting back at the beginning.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:33]** If you could tell a new player to Starfinder or to TTRPGs, what's something you would say?

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:36]** It's a little nugget of wisdom.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Let it be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** What?

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** Let it be.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:45]** And then I said I was kidding because it was a word of wisdom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:46]** That's funny.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** It's good.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:55]** I'm going to change the music because I was really excited for this but no one else is excited for this so I'm going to just tone the music down a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** I don't know how to answer that question.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** I'm going to tone it down.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:03]** Other than to say... What's something you would tell a new player?

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** Don't focus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** I would tell them to read the book, honestly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:10]** Just focus on getting to know your character.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:15]** Don't focus too much on the other stuff.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** Focus on your character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:26]** Well, and I'm saying this, like, not as, like, the rules lawyer where I want to read everything in the book, which I feel bad because I haven't read the entire book front to back because I don't like reading, actually.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:30]** But I do want to know what each thing does individually, so I look them up as we go most of the time.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:38]** But for new player, I would definitely suggest reading, like, that chapter one and all the story stuff in the back.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:46]** I think it really fulfills, like, or fills up the world that you're going to be taking in, and I think that helps negotiate the character and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** My advice sucked.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:49]** No, I think your advice is very tough.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** Judging advice, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:52]** It was good, Will.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:54]** I don't have it on a notepad in front of me that I'm writing.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** I'm judging it harshly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:01]** I think it falls in the same rule of like, I don't need to know everything that a biohacker does to play with you.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:04]** So I'm learning everything I can about a soldier.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:06]** And then whenever we do something, I'm like, oh, what's that do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:21]** I mean, I liken it to if you were to play a Star Wars tabletop role-playing game, you'd probably be pretty excited because there's a small but finite chance that you already know a lot about the world of Star Wars.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** So going in, you'd be like, oh, I know that.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** Oh, yeah, I know that Jedi.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** I know that type of creature.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** But you don't know Starfinders.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** That's good advice, Kev.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:29]** That's good advice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** You remember Grayling Corvette?

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** I remember.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** Yeah, I remember.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** Chewbacca.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** I remember Chewbacca.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:44]** I was hoping that we'd get to that quote.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:44]** Yeah, I remember.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:47]** I remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** Nick, what advice do you have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:56]** My advice would be a little bit of Will, a little bit of Kev.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:59]** Really, the fun part about Starfinder...

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:05]** is just deep diving into your character and existing in that world.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** Like at the end of the day, you're telling your own character's personal story.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:37]** now to avoid the frustration make sure you read up on the rules rules first and my last bit of advice and this i think is the kind of the ultimate middle ground is i've planned out my character through level 14. i would recommend that anybody starting a character on starfinder projects their character out because not only does it help you tell your character you're not going to survive plus level 12 man or level three maybe


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** Hopefully you won't survive level two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:42]** I mean, Jon's trying to just kill us all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:46]** I mean, let him finish.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** Let him finish.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:50]** My thought is, though, is that it helps you tell a good story.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:55]** It helps you kind of keep in mind what your character wants as you play the game.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:59]** The things your character wants to pick up as they play the game.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:03]** The things that your character wants to build as they play the game.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:06]** So you look for opportunities to make that happen in the world.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** So that way, you're not just kind of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:37]** opportunity storytelling which doesn't create a lot of cohesion no i'm sorry i wasn't i wasn't trying to shoot you down i think it's a great idea to like play forward but i do think personally i don't go more than like two levels ahead at a time at least uh yeah i was just my advice along that line it's starfinder at least versus other games i would say don't ever be afraid of multi-class um it's

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** But we haven't even gotten there yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** You should always embrace the multiclass.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** Well, Nico multiclassed.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:43]** I think we talked about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:45]** Yeah.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:47]** What about you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** Mr. Kelly.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:50]** Mr. Kelly.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:58]** It's kind of been said more or less, but make sure you draw a distinction between what you would want to do and what your character would do.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:02]** And just remember that your character can be very separate from what you are.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:08]** So if they're chaotic, neutral, really play to that and not necessarily what you would do.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:10]** It really kind of develops cohesiveness.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** And then...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:35]** i think checking out lore i just like reading lore online these days that's really fun and then as as was mentioned you'll kind of come across it in the world and be like oh sweet ryzo publishes a lot of cool stuff too that should be really thought of as like gold source like yeah character stuff back background all that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** Yeah, there's a lot of world to cover.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:42]** So if that at all interests you, or even if you're like, I don't know.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:51]** Yeah, they will have something in there, some nugget of a cool idea that grabs the hook in your mind, and you're like, that's pretty sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:54]** Yeah, I've read a lot of the Shari stuff in...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:19]** million archives too but you think it's kind of crazy when you think about it like if you look at star wars and how expansive that that world is it's not that expansive because they keep like rewriting it or re-sculpting it and then you look at paizo and paizo has everything because like in star wars some of those characters that pop up in mandalorian that they reused there is no backstory for them

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:23]** It was just that it was a good idea at the time to make this creature that looked like this.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:29]** And then now Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau are building these backstories for him.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** But Paizo, they're like, no, this is an Osharu.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:34]** They come from this planet and they do this stuff and they have all these people.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:42]** They have book after book after book after book that is so detailed about every character and creature and world and God.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:43 - 00:09:07]** guns all the armor like it's crazy paizo puts so much work into this stuff and i i just man good job guys and gals that's a collective thank you to paizo yeah big thanks big thanks for writing such high praise very laudable work praise log

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:11]** That's a separate podcast, but may all your logs be smooth.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:11]** Yes.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** Thank you.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:15]** Hopefully they won't contact us asking us to pay.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:18]** We get it at that app.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:30]** Yeah, we might not because it would be cool to have the people there just send us a little message acknowledging our podcast and then probably say something along the lines of, yeah, don't do that again.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** Stop recording your podcast.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:33]** I would expect nothing less from them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:36]** Then we'll hand it over to our lawyers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:40]** Yeah, we'll have their people talk to our people and it'll be great.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:43]** So I think it is time.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Let's get back to it.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** To jump in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** About to kill someone.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** I'm not going to lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:56]** I said before last week's episode, I was like, guys, whatever you do, there's going to be a lot coming.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:58]** It's going to be awesome.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** Let's all jump in.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:05]** And now I'm going to say it on air, not just to players, but also to the listeners.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:12]** If this is not your first time listening and you've been following this whole time, get ready because this roller coaster ain't over yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:16]** And if this is your first time, I would encourage you to go back and listen to episode one.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:21]** And two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight and nine all the way up until 25.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** Yes.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:24]** Because this is episode 25.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** 25.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:27]** 25.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:29]** Quarter of a century?

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** Quarter?

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:31]** No, that's not how I remember it.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:31]** Zoltan!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:33]** Zoltan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** What does Zoltan have to do with 25?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** Dude, where's my card, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:41]** What's the 25 reference?

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** It just sounded like a really good moment to put it in there.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:46]** It was good.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** Hey, you know what?

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** We're all about feel-good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:52]** I'm not proud of that, but that was my favorite movie of the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** Dude, where's my card?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:56]** And I probably didn't understand half the references in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:56 - 00:11:04]** Yeah, I didn't understand half the references either, but... It's good stuff.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** It just stuck with you.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:07]** It was funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** Okay, I want to just check in real quick.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:11]** Do a little status update.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:15]** Where is... Okay, good.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** What about your characters?

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** What is their health at?

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:21]** Are they feeling good?

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Because I just want to put this out there.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:29]** Again, the day started, and I believe on this day, Nico has been hit twice.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:34]** First by a trapdoor, and then by you all fought Jin Chiroga.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:36]** Then you fought Kostanek.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:36]** Jin Chiroga!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:38]** Jin Chiroga!

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:43]** Then you went and fought three pirates, and then now you're fighting presumably another pirate.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:47]** And it's just going and going and going.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** So where are you health-wise?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** It's been a hell of a day, John.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:53]** Yeah.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:59]** I'm 8 out of 12 stamina, 14 out of 16 hit points, and I have 3 out of 5 resolve to get granular about it.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** And I'm out of spells.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:04]** I don't have any more spells that I can cast, so I'm going to have to roll my cantrips.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** Need some sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:25]** yeah eventually eventually i'm gonna go ahead and say this right now for level two characters we've shown a remarkable level of endurance we've survived a lot you have and i will say i think that's a factor of two things one


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** Obviously, you all have played smart.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:37]** There have been some combats that have been somewhat challenging, some a little more challenging, and a good number of them, you know, you've played smart.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Good things have happened.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:40]** It's also, I think... You've had some good luck.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:42]** You've had a lot of good luck.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** You've had some smart combat.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** That's also Starfinder.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:50]** I think Starfinder puts a lot up front for you to last and endure, as you said.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:57]** But then the thing is that once you cross that threshold into death, it's a pretty slippery slope.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:01]** So until you get there, you've got a lot of chances.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:14]** But once you do, and when that day comes, when that episode happens, not only will I be overjoyed, but we will treat it with all the fairness and continuity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:17]** Well, just don't do it to Nick because he's got his character built up to level 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** That's right.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:21]** That, Nick, is what we call plot armor.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** Hey.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** Quick fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:28]** Shoot.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** He's doing all right.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** Rick is good.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:33]** Rick is good.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:37]** I mean, he got hit pretty hard in that last battle.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:40]** He got hit before, but he's used one resolve point so far.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** So I'm at four out of five resolve points.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:46]** And my stamina is only down to 10 out of 16, but I'm still good on hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:50]** So he's a robot, and he's fighting through it.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:57]** Nico, by the way, 9 to 12 stamina, 4 of 16 hit points remaining.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:58]** Stay the night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** You did get shot a lot, yeah.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:01]** Yeah.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** What about Dr.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** O.K.?

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:04]** Dr.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** O.K.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:10]** 's at full stamina, full hit points, full results.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** Ah, Dr. O.K.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:12]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** He also blocks out of battles, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:19]** That is very, very correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:21]** I'm not going to fight this one, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Bye, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** Oh, wait.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** I beg.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:27]** Slime.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** That's just so good.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Yeah, true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** Well, I'm a slimy guy.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** You're a slimy guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** I can't be trusted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** I'll say this.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:41]** Best of luck to all of you.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:41]** Come on, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:48]** Such a turd sandwich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** No, I mean that wholeheartedly.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** I mean, this is fun.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:51]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** May the odds be in your favor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** May the odds ever be in your favor.

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:02]** I'm definitely out to kill you, but I'm not always out to make a challenge every combat.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:12]** Not every combat needs to be super challenging, but every combat needs to be realistic in the sense of motivations, tactics, and they will inevitably present their own challenges.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:16]** Not everything needs to be a possible death threat.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** That being said, I hope it is.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:19]** Let's jump in.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** I'm going to pull you guys over.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** We're going to jump right back in.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:24]** We're still in round one.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:28]** You went into the gym of the ship.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:36]** After hearing some thuds, you pull along two of the space pirates as hostages, looking in and entering.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:47]** You find two Lozu Pahirs, two first mates, one unconscious, one searching through the pockets of the unconscious one.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:49]** And as you do that, the unconscious one wakes up.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:56]** You all determine who you are quite confident is not Lozu, possibly a shapeshifter.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** Who knows?

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** But as a result, you start attacking.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:05]** We are in the middle of round one.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:13]** I believe Nico had just done a trick attack and then fired on the not Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:20]** Well, you didn't tell the listeners who were just listening to this for the first time and didn't listen to the last episode.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:20]** Go back and listen to it.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:24]** But they used some kind of holographic skill.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** And so now not only is there.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** I was getting there.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:26]** You.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** You literally cut me off.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** There's like five losers now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:32]** Wait, I thought there were four, hopefully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:40]** Well, no, there's one on the ground, the one standing, and then four more on top of that, and then Nick Nico shot one of them, so now we're down to five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:44]** Now, everything that John had prepared was ruined.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Ruined.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** He didn't have anything prepared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:49]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** The whole episode.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:53]** The whole adventure was relying on that one moment.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:56]** I had practiced it for, I don't know, eight months.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** Practiced it in the mirror.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:58]** Practiced it in the mirror.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** Practiced it for my girlfriend, for everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** And Kevin ruined.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** Not for me.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** I would have corrected you.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:06]** How dare you.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** How dare you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:13]** Do you have that one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** That was my favorite one by far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:15]** I'm sorry, John.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** Do you want to go back or do you want to finish?

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:17]** No, it's okay.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** You don't need to apologize for anything.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:22]** So now we're staring down five of these Lozu things.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** Three.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** You're getting it wrong, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** I asked you.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:30]** Kev, your rules lawyer, not assistant GM.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:32]** I'm still counting the Lozu on the ground.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:37]** And I asked you how many holograms did the other loser make?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:41]** So Nico fired and one of the holograms disappeared.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** There are three currently standing in that square.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:44]** There are three not losers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:48]** Are we saying three holograms as in there are four figures?

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:50]** Or is it three figures?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** There are three figures.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** I'm going to put you guys onto the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** Oh, because that's what I asked.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:56]** How many holograms did that person make?

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:58]** And you said four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** They made three holograms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** Yeah, so there are three holograms left, four figures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:04]** Okay, okay.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:04]** Sorry, my mistake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:07]** The real Lozu better not stand up and confuse things.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** That's all I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:10]** Well, keep in mind, we talked about this last time.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:14]** Not Lozu is wearing casual station wear, or who you assume is not Lozu.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:20]** Who you assume is real Lozu is wearing their armor that you have seen her in many times before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:26]** This is a strange... This is a strange place.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** That is exactly it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:30]** I could not have said it better myself.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** Very, very correct.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** So...

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** Nico, you went.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:40]** One of the holograms disappears, and it is now Dr.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** O.K.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:42]** 's turn.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** We're in the middle of round one.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** We're in the gym.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:46]** You're fighting a lot of Lozus.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:56]** I'm going to throw this grenade that I just picked up.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:56]** Okay.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:57]** Okay.

**[00:18:59 - 00:18:59]** All right.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:02]** Right about there.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** Say this square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** Is it a frag grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Okay, it's a frag grenade.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** What's the range on the frag grenade?

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:11]** The range on a frag grenade is... Wait, am I in the radius?

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:11]** No.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:13]** No, the range on a frag grenade I think is 20 feet.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** I'm looking right now.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:15]** Is that range low?

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:18]** Yeah, it's just 20 feet, so you got to be within 20 feet, Boyle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:25]** So I need to move then, and then just let it go, but then I can't do that, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:30]** Well, what is the explosive radius of... The explosive radius of a frag grenade is 15 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** 15 feet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:34]** Oh, so it's only like three squares-ish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:39]** So it's 15 feet out from where it lands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** Well, in every direction, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:43]** Yeah, so basically you roll an attack against the square you want to land it in.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** That's AC5.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:46]** Make sure you don't super fail on it.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** You're probably going to get it.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:52]** Once you do that, it is a 15-foot box?

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:52]** Cone?

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:53]** Not cone.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:54]** Sphere?

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:56]** That is a really good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:59]** So if I can toss to this square...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** Rules lawyer, do you know?

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:01]** I don't know.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:02]** You don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:06]** That puts these people in harm's way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:11]** Within 15 feet, I think kind of all around is what I'm going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:22]** So literally, the mechanic is everything 15 feet in front of me, if I throw it as far as I possibly can, because the range is 20 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:29]** If you throw in that square next to Lozu, the actual Lozu is going to be in the blast radius.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:29]** Are you sure you want to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** I think he does want to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:34]** Is that a 15-foot radius or a 15-foot diameter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** 15-foot radius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** It's area 15 feet.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** Area 15 feet.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** I don't know how they calculated it.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** Let's find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:44]** I think that would be a diameter then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:45]** Okay.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:50]** Because you're saying it'd be a 9x9 square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:56]** Okay, so it's a 9x9 square from the center of where it hits, right?

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:58]** That's what I'm assuming.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** I'm trying to look at it.

**[00:20:59 - 00:20:59]** Okay.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:02]** Do you think, while Kevin's figuring that out, do you think you still want to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** Dr. Okay?

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:12]** I mean, on the basis of that, then I need to... I still need to move either way.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** Okay.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** Right?

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** So I can't do...

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:19]** I can move and I can equip it.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** I can't release it.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:21]** Right.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** You can move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:24]** Yeah.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** You would use your standard action as, as another move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** Yeah.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:30]** So I can either move and equip it or just move.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** Yep.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:36]** And do something else, which I can also do.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:36]** Okay.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:45]** I'm going to move and then inject Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:46]** Oh.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** Hey, yo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** He's right there.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:58]** And I am going to hit him with a...

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:01]** I think it's a basic booster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:04]** Basic booster.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** What does that do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:10]** He's going to get a plus one enhancement to his AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** Nice.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:12]** All right.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:16]** So as you do that, Nico's going to be like, wait, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:20]** Actually, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:22]** Do you have a lot of skill checks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** Yeah, I do.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** I mean, my trick attack is based on my skill check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:32]** Okay, so I'm going to give him a plus two bonus to skill checks.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** All skill checks.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** Nice.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:40]** For four rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:41]** There we go.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** That is awesome.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:50]** And Nico, as you do that, Dr. O'Kate, Nico's going to be like, wait, wait, wait, what are you doing?

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** Oh, okay.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:55]** Is someone feeling relaxed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** I found it.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** I am indeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:04]** Page 183 of the core rulebook says grenades are thrown weapons.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** It is an explosive radius.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** So it would be a 30-foot circle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:11]** So, yeah, it's huge.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Yeah, it's huge.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:16]** It's literally like you have to throw it 20 feet.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:44]** why is why do you get 20 feet is that that's the range that's the range of the throne range and the blast radius is 15 feet so it's literally you can't even throw it like close unless you want to throw it as far as you want without getting blowback that doesn't make sense to me at all okay or you have to be behind cover yeah maybe maybe paizo doesn't know the difference between a radius and a diameter i doubt that wow


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** All right, Dr.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** O.K., let's keep this combat rolling.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** So what are you going to do instead?

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** You went up, you injected Nico?

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:56]** Yeah, so I'm going to inject Nico, and I'm going to be right here.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:57]** You're going to be right there.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:05]** All right, so just so everyone at home listening, not playing, there are a bunch of Lozus in the center.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:05]** Dr.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** O.K., Sabrina, Rick, and Nico are just inside the door to the right.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:13]** Godwina and Hears are right outside.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:16]** It is Lozu's turn.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:34]** You see who you presume to be the real Lozu suddenly look around, start to move her hands, and she is going to take a guarded step and move back, carefully looking at not Lozu, and she is going to start turning over.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** She appears to be looking for something.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** One would guess it is possibly a weapon.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:42]** Rick, what are you doing?


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:42]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:44]** So there's still how many of the holograms?

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:45]** Two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:47]** Three figures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** There's still two?

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:51]** There's three non-lozus there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:54]** There are four non-lozus in the space.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Four now?

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:55]** I thought one was dead.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:56]** No.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:57]** No, no, no.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** There were four.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** Holograms.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** Yeah, there were four holograms.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** One real one.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** So there are five.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** Oh, I thought it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:05]** Okay.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** Killing me, John.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** That's probably on me.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** I probably messed something up.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** I take responsibility.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:11]** There are four.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:13]** That's where we're at.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** What are you doing, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:17]** Well, now I don't want to waste supercharge on a damn hologram.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:19]** This is making me angry.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:21]** Because the grenade would have just fixed that for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:24]** We should just throw the damn grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** What are you going to do?

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** I know.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** That doesn't make sense.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** I'm really upset about this grenade thing.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:36]** And I'm trying to... I spent my whole time trying to Google what the hell they're talking about, whether it's... Can I throw a grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** So, can I, like, do...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** She's out of range right now.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:48]** If you count Lozu Square and go two in front and two in back, Lozu is outside the 30-foot radius.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** Does anyone else have any other grenades?

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** You can toss them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** I mean, I have a grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** I have other grenades on me.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:57]** If you want to make a free action, just say that, Dr. O.K.

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:00]** Rick, you probably know that Dr. O.K.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:00]** has one.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:04]** But that would be your action would be taking it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:07]** Yeah, you can't use it this round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:15]** He didn't use his grenade because of this debate whether it's a radius or... Look, it's a radius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** I'm going to say it's a radius.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** It says it's close to a radius.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** I'm making a call.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** It's a radius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:23]** But that doesn't make any sense if it's got a 20-foot throw.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:27]** I'm so blown away from it.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:31]** But I don't want to waste my supercharge on a damn hologram.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** But I have to shoot.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** This is stupid.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:38]** It's really putting me in a corner where I either waste a supercharge or I don't shoot, which I waste a supercharge.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** Either way, I'm going to waste a supercharge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:47]** I think we should have had a surprise round because he literally came in the door, waved in the 4-4, and said, Papa, don't hit me no more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** While your line is compelling.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** Come on.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:00]** He's got to get something for both being funny and being right at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:02]** Come on.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** I disagree.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:09]** I think there's a one out of two in that it was funny, but you came in and you didn't say, I want to attack.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:14]** And I let you keep the supercharge, even though technically you might have not been.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** He did the equivalent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** I'm sorry.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** I object to your honor.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:21]** He did the equivalent of readying an action.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:32]** He came in there, waved the 4-4 in, as Wilp said it, kicked her hostage down, used her as a human shield and said, put down the gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:36]** All I'm saying is that then, not Lozu started to talk.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:39]** Then real Lozu possibly woke up.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:42]** At no point did Kev say, I'm just firing.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:44]** I'm going to fire.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** I'm doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:46]** Okay.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** So Rick is going to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:47]** Okay.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** Rick is shooting at not Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:50]** I rolled a two.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:53]** I have a plus seven to hit.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:58]** So I have a nine to hit a hologram with my supercharged weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** I'm also sad it is my supercharge.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:00]** Believe me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:01]** All right.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** The shot fires wildly.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:05]** And there's soft cover from Dr. O.K.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** The point is that the shot fires wildly.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** Misses Dr.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:12]** O.K., hits the wall, the far wall across the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:16]** And there's now a 15-foot hole in the side of the ship, and we all die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** You rolled a what?

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:19]** A nine?

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** Yeah.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:23]** And that was what kind of a weapon against EAC or KAC?

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:24]** EAC.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** EAC.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** As you fire and it moves across...

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:33]** one of the holograms kind of got in the way of the shot and disappears.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:33]** Cool.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:34]** That's something.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:37]** So now there are only three not-losers in the space.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:39]** I know I should be excited for that, but I am not.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:44]** Well, I'm asking you to be excited because you want to know how many times my plans go wrong?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** All the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** At least 25.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:50]** AKA the number of times of episodes that we've had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** Here's, what are you doing on your turn?

**[00:28:54 - 00:29:01]** Here's is going, is taking Godwina into the room and he will move.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** Yes.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:09]** I'll say that now that we're in combat, Godwina and Sabrina will have turns in which they either will do something or not.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:14]** So if you want to move them in, so if you want to move them in,

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:16]** I mean, they're in the thing.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** Like, I'm going to give them an initiative order.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** What they do is, I don't know.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** You'll find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:24]** Can I just hang on to one with a disadvantage to my role or something like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:32]** If you want to make a strength check to pull them in, you can do a... I'll say that if you want to push her in, you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:39]** Can I keep her from doing things because she's bound and I can just hold on to her?

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:47]** I will say that you can't keep her, but if she does anything, you will be able to make an opposed...

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:52]** Uh, I wouldn't say if you want to grapple her and not be able to do anything else, that's fine.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:59]** If you just want to keep an eye on her, I'll say that like, maybe you get a plus two to whatever to an opposed role if she does anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:01]** That will have to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:04]** Grapple says you must have at least one free hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:05]** Right.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** So I don't think he's trying to grapple.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:15]** So I'm going to attempt to bring her in with me, which is a strength check, which is... Yes.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** Um...

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Oh, God.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:20]** It's a three.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:23]** I'm a very weak, flimsy insect person.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** It's not really easy.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** I'll say this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:27]** As you push her in, she sees what's going on.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** She saw what was happening.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** And as you push her, she does walk forward.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:35]** She seems to comply and walk forward with you.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** At least for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:39]** I supposedly killed her family.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** I do still want answers.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** So then I'm going to just keep walking.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** So that's five.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** Ah, damn it.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:44]** Ten.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:48]** And I'm going to kind of walk...

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:54]** in front of Nico, and then I'm going to cast daze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** Are you going to leave her behind?

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:00]** So you walk in, you leave her behind Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** If I can keep her with me the whole time, then that would be great.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:04]** Actually, I'll just put her here.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:04]** Yeah.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Actually, no, I'm not going to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** I don't want her to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:10]** So here's the thing.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:17]** In terms of her movement and her acting at the same time, I'll say that she goes along with it.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:19]** That would be part of her movement.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** She complies and goes with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** Gotcha.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** So I dragged her into the room.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:29]** I kind of put her in front of the pool in the northeast corner there and just kind of had her next to me.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:32]** I'm in front of Nico and I'm going to...

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:37]** Cast my daze cantrip and try to daze the low zoo closest to me.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:39]** The not low zoo closest to me, I should say.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** That's a DC of 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:42]** You're going to daze them.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:45]** DC of 15 against for you or for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:47]** That is the spell DC.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** So I need to beat that for a will save?

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** I believe so.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** Yeah.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:56]** Also, the spell short circuits the mind of a humanoid creature with a CR of three or lower.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** So that will have to be there.

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:01]** They're unable to take actions, but take no penalty to AC while they're dazed.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** But if they have a CR of 4 or higher, they're not affected.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:05]** Will negates.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:06]** Will negates.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:10]** So it will be a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:13]** Will save!

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** Congrats, NotLosu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:20]** I'm going to roll this giant D20 because I feel like that is just necessary.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** DC what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** 15?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:24]** Yes.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** She rolled a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** Got it.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** She got the will save.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:33]** So you see her kind of shake it off.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:35]** She is not dazed.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:37]** It says plus two versus SR.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:38]** What's that?

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** That's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** I'm not sure.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** I forget.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** I looked it up like five times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** We're always going to forget that.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** All right, that's fine.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** So you don't daze her.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:49]** Okay.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** You do not daze him.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** But she seems to shake it off.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:57]** Whatever magic or ability she's able to use her to.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Oh, plus two against spell resistance.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** Yeah, she doesn't have spell resistance.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** A little peak.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:06]** But whatever she did in order to cast a holographic clone, she does.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** She beats it.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** It's all good.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:09]** All right.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** Is that your turn?

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** That's my turn.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:13]** All right.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:16]** It is top of round two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** It is Sabrina's turn.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:27]** Sabrina turns to Rick and says, am I always going to need to be like this or can I stand up?

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** Stay down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** You say stay down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:35]** And he'll nudge her or he'll step on because he's like stepping on her calf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:36]** That's fine.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** She stays down.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:39]** She seems to comply.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:39]** Interesting.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:45]** It is not Lozu's turn.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** What does not Lozu do?

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** They look over.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** Who do they attack?

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** Kiers who dazed?

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** Niko who shot?

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** Rick who shot?

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:55]** That is tough.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:58]** What do they do?

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** You know what?

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** I'm going to roll a d6 for this.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** 1-2.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** Here's 3-4.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:05]** 3-4 Niko.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** 5-6 Rick.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** That is going to be a 4.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:10]** That is Niko.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:15]** So because Niko did that sweet roll...

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:23]** then not Lozu is going to look at Nico and say, you think you're the only one who can do that?

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:30]** And she is going to make a trick attack on you.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:33]** What's your check?

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:36]** That is a, your DC is 21.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:41]** That is going to be, that was a 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:42]** Wait, what?

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:44]** Why is my DC only 21?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:48]** The DC for trick attack is 20 plus the creature CR.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:51]** As a PC, your CR is your level minus one.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** So it's 20 plus one.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** Okay.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** All right.

**[00:34:55 - 00:35:00]** So you are flat footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Flat footed.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Check it and see.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** No she though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** She is also flat-footed.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** That is very, very true.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:13]** That was just the bluff to see whether she completed the trick attack.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:17]** That was not the actual attack to see what was going on.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** So she is flat-footed.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:22]** Nico, you are now flat-footed as well.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:26]** And now she is going to – she has her pistol.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:31]** Actually, that was her full round pistol.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:36]** I'm wondering if she needed to pull out her pistol in order to do that because she didn't have her pistol up beforehand.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** So that would have been her move action.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** So did I just negate everything I just did?

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** I feel like I did.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:46]** Other than the fact that you gave me a minus one on my attack rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:49]** No, it's a full action to do a trick attack.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:52]** So she didn't have her weapon out, so she's going to pull her weapon out.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:54]** She can do that as part of her move action.

**[00:35:55 - 00:36:00]** So the thing is that whether or not you moved, you then make an attack.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:03]** She did not move, but I still feel like it's a full attack.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:05]** She should have had her weapon ready in order to make that happen.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** Also, does anybody disagree with me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:12]** Yeah, no, because that's the premise for me not throwing the frag.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** It's like I can't do both.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Right, that you need to pull out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:18]** So realizing now that I couldn't do any trick attack, Niko, you are not five-footed.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:24]** She's going to pull out this pistol, and she is going to fire that pistol at you.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:28]** And when she does that, this is – oh, I really hope this hits.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** I really hope this hits.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** Oh, I don't think that hits.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:37]** What's your... What is your EAC, KAC?

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** 12.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** EAC's 12.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** EAC is 12.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** What did I roll?

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Oh, no way.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** What's your KAC?

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** KAC is 13.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** KAC is 13?

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:48]** Yes!

**[00:36:49 - 00:37:13]** hits you as as she pulls out this weapon there seems to be this series of like prongs in the place of the pistol and as she fires it there's this little bead of energy that's like a little ball and it grows and grows and then you hear it and it flies across and hits you dead in the thigh and that is going to be

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Ooh, not very much.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:22]** Four points of electricity and force damage to you.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:24]** E and F, which I think is fire, actually.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:25]** Let me double check that.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** There's so many things I don't know with Starfire.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:29]** So that's electricity and fire, I believe it is.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Let's confirm that.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:35]** While we're doing that, it is... That was the move was to pull it out.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** The attack was to do that.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** Nico, it is your turn.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:39]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:44]** Well, Nico's not going to take too kindly to being shot at again.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:47]** Niko's going to be like, you're going to regret that.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:52]** And he's going to open fire with both blasters this time.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** All right.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** Give it to me.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Give me that roll.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:58]** Oh, my.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** That's a natural 18 plus three.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** That's a 21 to hit.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Yeah, that's a hit on the first one.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** Oh, gosh.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** That's only... Yeah.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** That's... Oh, sorry.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** I added my modifier.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** It's an actual 18 to hit on the first one.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** It's a 5 on the second one, so only hit once.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** Yep.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** Hit once, roll the damage.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Kev, what's up?

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:21]** John, does my 5 hit one of the holograms?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:31]** No, but because of what it is, it does not hit one of those.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:35]** However, does... Roll your damage for the one that does hit.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** There are three left, right?

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** That's two points of damage.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** Two points of damage.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:49]** The two points of damage hit, and the hologram does not disappear, so you think that it all went through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:52]** So that could mean that that's actually not those here?

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** What does that mean?

**[00:38:54 - 00:39:01]** Well, I thought... I was thinking if it hit, then the clones would disappear on impact.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** Obviously, that might not be the case.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:06]** They have some resistance, maybe, but...

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** I don't know, just positing an idea.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** Maybe it was Lozu.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** Or not Lozu, I should say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:18]** I mean, there's a very clear distinction between the Lozu that is here in the corner, that is further out, and the Lozu that is here.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:22]** The holograms seem to be all contained in the space that is the not Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** No, that's what I meant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Okay.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:27]** So it clearly hit the not Lozu.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:31]** Two points of damage seem to go through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** All right.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:43]** So I just want to clarify, I did find on page 269 defining effects, and it shows a 15-foot radius versus a 10-foot, and it is radius.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** So just for example, I drew up on the thing.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:54]** It would be three squares out from each side of a point where the grenade lands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:56]** Okay, got it.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** Thank you for clarifying that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:03]** On roll 20, that clearly shows that the actual Lozu is outside of that range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:06]** If it lands there, but he's also probably not good at throwing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** Well, it's Dr. K's turn, so what is Dr. K going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** Oh my god, if you want to throw it, throw it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:15]** It's an AC5 to make that happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:20]** Yes, I am going to throw to this corner here.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:21]** Okay.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:22]** So I roll, right?

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** I just...

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** You roll a ranged attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** You just roll the grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:30]** You're going to roll the grenade.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** All right.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:32]** Here goes nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:36]** Yeah!

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:38]** Fucking 20, I shit you not.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:42]** Yeah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:43]** Wow.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** Wow.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** So you roll.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:46]** You roll it.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** It hits that square.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** It hits the square right in front of Not Lozu.

**[00:40:51 - 00:41:01]** And based on some reading that I've done, the area effect spell will attack area spells and effects that don't require an attack roll, affect you normally, and don't destroy any of your figments.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:06]** So I will say that they hit all of Not Lozu.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** Okay, cool.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Yeah.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:10]** Good job, Will.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:13]** Roll twice and add your bonus twice.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:15]** Right, so you add your bonus each time.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** Nicely done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:20]** Just my regular attack range to attack bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:23]** It's whatever the frag damage is.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** So it's probably just 2d6.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:28]** And if you don't have any bonuses to that, then it's just 2d6.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** 4?

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** Four?

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Five.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** Nine points of damage.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:33]** Wow.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:41]** As this explosion and smoke totally fills the entire gym, it feels like.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:49]** The smoke starts to permeate up top, and this loud explosion rocks the gym.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** Nicely done.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:52]** Nicely done.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** You want to do anything else for your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:55]** What happens next?

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:59]** Yeah, well, like, the rest of my chunk, can I do a skill check?

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:03]** I want to do a life science check on this creature in front of me.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:06]** Again, I'm going to use my...

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:20]** I'm going to use my pious scientist to use a mysticism check on this creature with the hologram property.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:21]** Okay.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** Oh, okay.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:30]** And I got a life science plus 11, so 27 mysticism.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** I guess I can't move, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:36]** You cannot... Oh, because he pulled a grenade?

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** Well, the grenade was your attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:37]** You can move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** Well, he pulled the grenade using the move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** Oh, you pulled the grenade.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** Yeah, so you can't move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:43]** Good call, Will.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** I like your integrity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:45]** Yeah.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:47]** Hey...

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** If we don't have the rules, what else do we have?

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** You know whose turn it is after Dr.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** O.K.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** 's incredible success?

**[00:42:52 - 00:43:11]** In the confusion that partially takes over everyone's senses as the grenade explodes, then here's, right next to you, you feel as Godwina seems to be bullrushing you.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:11]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:12]** Come on, Godwina.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** Really?

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** Is there some kind of – she's also handcuffed.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** She is handcuffed.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** Don't you need a free hand?

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:20]** She doesn't have free hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:22]** I don't think she's going to try to body slam me probably.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:24]** She's just going to try and hit you, dude.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:25]** All right.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:30]** Yeah, that is a just direct hit.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** Let's see what that is.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:33]** Oh, come on.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** Big money, big money.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:36]** What is your KC plus eight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:39]** KC plus eight is 21.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** Don't you dare beat that.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:45]** Because I rolled a 26.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:45]** Oh, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:49]** I was so confident in my KC plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** That's fine.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:54]** You are knocked back five feet in front of Dr. Okay.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:55]** Okay.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** As part of that.

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:03]** What I don't know is if she stays in the square that she was in or she moves into the square that you suddenly occupied.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Not sure.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:08]** And I succeeded by another five feet.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** So she actually pushes you back another five feet.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** So you're pushed back 10 feet.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:36]** from god wina as she totally just bowls you over uh it doesn't say that you're not prone my guess is that uh it doesn't say i think she's probably just in the square that you were in makes sense i think if she's like bull rushing you that hard if any of you disagree players or listeners um listeners write in players don't tell me because uh you guys have enough vinegar and moxie for me tonight anyway

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** So I don't need to hear it.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:40]** It is, maybe you'll be happy about this.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** It is Lozu's turn.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:48]** Lozu seems to reach, and part of the mat, this whole mat has been that they were fighting on before.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:51]** You can presume that they were wrestling, fighting before.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** This whole mat is all over the place.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** Probably Dr. O.K.

**[00:44:55 - 00:45:08]** and Rick, you see as she reaches under, she feels something, reaches under, grabs and pulls out her azimuth laser pistol, quickly turns over and points it at Not Lozu.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:16]** And she is going to fire at Not Lozu with her azimuth laser pistol.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** What does she get?

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** Finally, I'm doing something for y'all.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** Thank you, John.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** Oh, wow.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** No, it's okay.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** You don't need to say thank you.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:27]** I'm just already doing great in making you guys upset.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** She actually rolled a natural one.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** I'm not going to lie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:31]** She did.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** She rolled a natural one.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:35]** It's actually going to probably hurt us in the end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:40]** Unless you guys really want to, I don't want a critical fumble because I think it makes sense that she's on the ground.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** She's hurt.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** She was just unconscious.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:42]** She came to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:44]** Oh, I'm for a critical fumble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:47]** You want a critical fumble for the person on your side?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** We're playing by the rules.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** We've got to play by the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** All right, rules lawyer.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** You want to tell me when to stop, rules lawyer?

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:54]** Sure.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:55]** Ready?

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** Three, two, one.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** We're keeping it going here.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:58]** We'll save.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:01]** All right, where we keep things going.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:04]** That is going to be...

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:06]** It worked better in my head.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:06]** I love this.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** Deal half damage to yourself and all creatures adjacent to you.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** Oh, there's nobody adjacent.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** Yeah, there's nobody adjacent.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:16]** So I'm going to say that as she pulled it up, she tried to fire.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:20]** And then when she fired, it like totally went back and just hit her.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:22]** She was not ready for that recoil.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:27]** That is going to be a D4.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:30]** She deals two points of damage.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:33]** And because she just came to, she falls unconscious again.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:42]** So Lozu Fahir, who you presume to be the real Lozu, is now currently unconscious across the room.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** Very unfortunate.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** I really like Lozu.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:49]** I think she brings a lot to the table, except for when she hits herself.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** Very, very unfortunate.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Rick, what are you doing on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:55]** He's going to move forward.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:56]** Okay.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:00]** Do I need to do anything to get past Sabrina?


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:00]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** No, I think you're fine.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** Are you taking her or is she on the ground?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** She's on her knees.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:08]** Yeah, he's just going to step past her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:11]** So you pick up the gun and you just walk past her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:37]** i mean the gun was like but i say like on her shoulder like he's holding the gun he was right but it's like above her shoulder that's fine yeah yeah yeah that's fine uh so he just he kind of just pushed her not even pushed her but like just stepped around her okay and walks forward with this rifle um can i roll a perception to see because so the grenade hit the actual character or the actual it hit the actual knot loser yeah so can i roll a perception to see that which one got hit or do i do it do i just automatically see


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:37 - 00:48:03]** i think you would have seen like here's the thing the as it says in the spell they mimic excuse me they mimic the movements and sound exactly you noticed before that when the hologram got hit it just disappeared there wasn't a reaction per se when the grenade went off you could see all three holograms like coughing like because it's clear that the real creature took the damage real creature yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:15]** So my question though is can I roll a perception to see if there is any kind of ash or actual physical damage to the one – or you're saying all the mirrors are going to be the same?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:17]** Yeah, I think the mirrors are the same.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:19]** You just have to burn through the mirrors.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** There's no way to like –


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:42]** did I get anything for my awesome mysticism by the way oh you're super right I'm so sorry you can tell this you rolled a 27 which is a badass roll judging by what you know now of Trostenec and looking at this not Lozu and the way that it spoke you can assume that this is an astrozoan

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** Because you were trying to do a life science to identify it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:55]** No, I was using my... I'm trying to identify, like... Hold on.

**[00:48:55 - 00:49:06]** Can I do, like, a... Because of my pious scientist ability, I can use it towards mysticism, like, for this.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:10]** I guess it's only for identify creature, which would be a life science anyway, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Right.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** That's what I thought you were doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** Okay.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** So as a surprise to no one, it's an Astro Zone.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:22]** Do I know anything about this spell, though?

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:34]** I will say that because it was a Mississippi track in your pie stuff, you know that this spell, it's called Holographic Clone, and it mimics, it essentially is mirror image used for operatives.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:34]** Okay.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:35]** It's an operative exploit.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:39]** So sorry about that, that we didn't get to that earlier.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:40]** Totally my bad.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** We had a lot going on.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:43]** Rick, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:48]** So yeah, he's going to step around them to get a clear shot.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:52]** And then he's going to just pick one of the targets and shoot at it.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:54]** He's going to pick one of the targets and shoot at it.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:58]** Because you're saying there's no way I can identify the one from the others.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:03]** Like whatever damage happened to the one, the main one, it looks like the same damage happened to the other ones.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:03]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** It's holographic clone.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** 12 plus 17.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:12]** No, plus 7.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** Sorry.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:15]** 12 plus 7 is a 19?

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:17]** Plus 7 for a 19 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Okay.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** All righty.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:19]** Let's see.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:21]** And what is your damage?

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** I'm going to walk away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** Okay, it hits then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** I'm not saying that.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** I'm just saying what is your damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** Well, it hits something.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:31]** So my damage, I believe, is a 1d10.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** Okay.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** Of fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:40]** Okay, I will tell you now then that as you shoot, one of the holograms disappears.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** There are two left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** Stupid.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Kevin's mad now.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** All right, moving on.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:49]** Two here.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:53]** It's only round two.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** Please tell me you have a magic missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** I used all my spells.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:02]** I'm going to try to daze one of these noobs again.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:04]** DC 15.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:05]** Do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:09]** DC 15 will save again when I use the big boy.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Wow, that was dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:19]** Rick says while Kelly's taking his thing, Rick wanted to say so which one are you?

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** Yucks or

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:22]** Hold on.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** Let me rephrase this.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:26]** I have to look up the thing now.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:27]** Where did my window go?

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:28]** All combat freezes.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:28]** Yeah.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:29]** Pause.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:30]** Yeah.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:39]** Rick, as he finishes the shot, one of the holograms disappears, and he says, which one are you, Yox or Cub?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:40]** All righty.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:47]** And the daze is successful as they fail the will save.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:48]** Wow.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** Nice.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:52]** After a creature has been dazed by the spell.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:53]** Wow.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Unable to take actions.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** No penalty, Daisy.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** Crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:57]** Well, wait.

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:02]** So then did I daze the OG, not Lozu, in this case?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:07]** I mean, the thing is, again, area spells and effects that don't require... I don't know.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:11]** I think spells... What's the range on daze?

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:11]** I'm looking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:12]** Range.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** Close.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** Let's see.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:17]** 25 plus 5 feet over two levels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:28]** And it targets one person, so it should be like a... You should just roll to see if it hits the one that he... Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is no attack roll required.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** I think that hits the actual creature.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** They're dazed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** Yeah.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:34]** Wouldn't that break the spell?

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** This terrible, horrible spell of clones?

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:41]** If it hits... Because it breaks their mental concentration, I feel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:49]** The target is one humanoid, so you should have, like, roll a... You don't tell me what to do, Kev.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** I'm giving suggestions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** Yep, knew it.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:56]** I read on the forums, by the way, that the community thinks the spell is broken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** Weird.

**[00:52:59 - 00:52:59]** Correct.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:01]** I think it's freaking awesome.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:06]** So concentration and interrupted spells.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:09]** Take damage from some effect that failed against a saving throw.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** The spell fails.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:11]** Here's the thing.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:14]** Is holographic clone a spell?

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:15]** Yes.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:17]** It's not mirror image.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** It's a special ability.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:18]** Oh, you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:21]** It's like a Technomancer thing.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:25]** If I recall correctly on the operatives, because I researched, I looked into this.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:27]** In fact, I think I asked John about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:28]** It's not mirror image.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:34]** It is this creature's special ability that is similar to mirror image.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:37]** The special ability, that's the difference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** Yeah, shrug your shoulders and move back.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** The most frustrating fight.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** This is only the beginning.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** Oh, I love it.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** I'm so excited.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:49]** Wait until we get to, like, imp corporeal creatures and all that other weird stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** Oh, I'm so excited.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:54]** Honestly, the frustrating fights are the memorable ones.

**[00:53:54 - 00:54:02]** Because you know the next time that there's a holographic clone, there's going to be a collective groan of, like, oh, my gosh.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** It's going to be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** I'm going to write it in there.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:12]** Just expect your astrozoan, like, when we finally kill this thing, just expect it just to be mutilated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:21]** I should actually have advantage, I think, because I used... I have to check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:24]** Let's explore that in a sec while you're checking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** But we can help.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:26]** Sorry.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:30]** Point is... Let me...

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:30]** I'll allow it.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:31]** I'll allow it.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:39]** The Day's spell, he had to target one of the three remaining non-Losus with this Day's spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** It's not an attack roll.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** I still don't think it's an attack roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:46]** It's not an attack, but the target is one humanoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:53]** But you were saying, John, that it actually hit actual non-Losu.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** I feel like it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** I feel like you're casting it there.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** It's not an attack roll.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:01]** The nuance says it's not an attack roll.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:04]** So there's no chance that it's going to hit any of the clones.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:06]** It's going to hit the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:10]** So if they don't make an action...

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:20]** then we would use that knowledge that the one that was hit with the spell is the real one and then target that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:23]** But you can't target it any differently than the other ones.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:25]** When you roll an attack, there are two left.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:30]** If you roll an attack roll, there will still be a chance that you hit one of the clones.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** You don't know which one happens.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:33]** There are two.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:35]** They both now are dazed.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** There are still two if you attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:40]** I didn't get a chance to do the whole, because they did such high sense motives.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:45]** I didn't get the chance to play the game of like, which one would the other one tell me to kill?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:48]** Do I have something cool to go down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** I'm going to say this.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:52]** My timer just went off, but I think we should just push it.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:54]** Like, let's just keep going a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:55]** You guys want to keep going a little bit?

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** Let's keep it going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** Yeah, at least until these holograms are gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:58]** Oh, okay.

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:59]** All right.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:01]** Yeah, you tell me when the episode's done, Kev.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:02]** Yeah.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** Yeah, you tell me.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:05]** I'm just joking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:05]** What were you saying, Will?

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:07]** You got something up your sleeve?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** Yeah.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** Will's got something up that Osharu sleeve of his.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** It's all slimy.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:13]** His sluggy body.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** I'm going to say that the daze counts.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:21]** I think as much as I don't want to, because I want to win, I think you guys, with the rules, the daze hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:25]** So they don't take any action, but we still have no idea which way is going.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:25]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:29]** There are still two of them that look very corporeal, and you're not sure which is which.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** There's still a mischance when you attack.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** They take no actions.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** Well done, Hears.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** You want to do anything else with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** Gloat.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:40]** I'm going to try to secure Godwina.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** Can you do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** Can I?

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:49]** days is a, uh, attack is, is, is that a standard action?

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** Um, excellent question.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** I think so.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** Standard action.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:55]** It's a standard action.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** So you could move.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:00]** Rick is now between you and God, you know, I'm fine then.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:01]** Okay.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:03]** Next person.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** All right.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:04]** That's fine.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:05]** That was quick.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** I'll just let that go.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:09]** It is the top of, I believe around three.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:11]** It is Sabrina's turn.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** What does Sabrina do?

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:17]** Dr. Okay, you just hear behind you this big sigh.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:25]** And maybe, Nico, you see out of the corner of your eye that Sabrina just sits down on the floor, crisscross applesauce, and just starts to watch.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:38]** It is not Lozu's turn, and they stand there blinking, trying to gain focus, and they can't because they are dazed.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Nico, what are you doing in your turn?

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** Nico...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:44]** Oh, I wanted to ask this question.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** There are two left.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:51]** If I take a full attack, can I target two different projections?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:59]** I think this is the whole thing that's been going on is the way the spell works is depending on if you hit the target or not is whether... That's just how the spell is written.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:04]** I know, but... There's not any actual target for us to aim and point at.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:06]** That's why we're all getting so frustrated with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:10]** But I mean, I make two separate attack rolls when I do a multi-attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** Yes, you can't target two creatures.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:13]** You target the creature.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:16]** I roll to see whether you hit the creature or the clone.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** That is it.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** But you'll have two shots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:21]** But you'll have two shots, so you have two chances.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:24]** And there are two left, so odds are you'll hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:30]** So it says if the attack hits, roll randomly to see whether the selected target or a figment.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:32]** If the figment is hit, the figment is destroyed.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** If the real target, blah, blah, blah.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:55]** so yeah every time we take an attack on this this target we're attacking the group of the figments and the per the actual target at the same time which is silly it should actually just be multiple targets and we have to try to decipher which one is which but that's this is less fun yeah this is this is a yeah john you really know how to pick the broken one


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:56 - 00:59:01]** I'm just doing my do which is providing an awesome adventure and fun challenge.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:23]** I think I might just break it Well if I were John I would have done that something like this I understand John, but all right still I hate you at the same time Now he's going to do it to us every time I think I might break the broken thing right now Weird hopefully all the enemies you fight are operatives with a holographic clone That is crazy They can shapeshift

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:28]** They all just felt like multi-classing inoperative.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** Dr. K, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:33]** Wait, you completely bypassed my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:38]** By the way, did you not know that that also happens with this spell?

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** You could just bypass people's turns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:39 - 01:00:09]** weird rule that Paiso put in there if you look in text it's really tiny it's written in like .5 font yeah anyway go ahead Nico give me both your attacks they're probably gonna miss fucker you put that in the world first one's a 9 against EAC wait a minute wait a minute hold on against EAC yeah

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:19]** With that first shot, the last clone disappears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:20]** Oh, thank God.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:21]** Yes.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:24]** And with the second shot... Four more clones appear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:27]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:29]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** What's the second shot?

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:31]** Natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** Yeah.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:37]** Well, we're getting there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** This is good.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** This is good.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** You can't write for this app.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:47]** This is why I love this game and this podcast.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** All right, rules cards, get out of my way.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:53]** Nick, tell me when you want me to stop on your imminent death.

**[01:00:55 - 01:01:03]** We just went through all the cards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:04]** Let's try again.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** Three, two, one.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:07]** I said stop in Shreebook.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:07]** Come on, man.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:08]** Okay, ready?

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:10]** Three, two, one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:11]** Wookie.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:15]** All right.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:15]** It's kind of delightful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** Yeah, it's kind of great.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** What weapon are you using again?

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:21]** Asthmath laser pistol.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:24]** So that is a laser weapon.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:26]** Oh, this is bad.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:29]** Rang your own bell.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:37]** You take half weapon damage and move one step down the wisdom poison track until healed.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:37]** What the hell?

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:40]** What is the wisdom poison track?

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:42]** Page 416 of the core rulebook.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:46]** You can't just make it easy and tell me, can you?

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:46]** The card doesn't tell me.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** I don't know.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:49]** So here's the thing.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** You're shooting.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** You're hitting yourself.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** Roll for damage and take half.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:54]** Okay.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:54]** Um...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:55 - 01:02:18]** wisdom poison is on um weakened it's on hero lab under afflictions yeah you can add it to your afflictions the victim takes a minus two penalty to will saves and wisdom based ability checks and skill checks and the dc but you still have a plus two to those so you're fine for now until you're healed yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:26]** Well, no, but he also has for five rounds, he has plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:29]** But then after that, so he's fine for another 30 seconds.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:34]** And then after that, you will have minus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:37]** I'm sorry, four rounds.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** 24 seconds.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** Sucks for you, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:41]** So you have three.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:44]** Actually, because it's already been one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:44]** Yeah.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:45]** Yeah, so three.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** Three more rounds.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** Three more rounds.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:51]** And you thought you were going to get the big drop on me.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:52]** How much damage did you take?

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:54]** I rolled a one on my damage counter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:56]** So you take minimum one damage.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:57]** You take one damage.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:58]** That's fine.

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:01]** Still one more damage that I didn't need to do myself.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:02]** It's all right.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** It'll all work out in the long run.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:06]** Who knows what's going to happen next.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:07]** Well done, though.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:08]** It was a good try.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:13]** And ultimately you failed because I feel like the wisdom thing is that sense that you realize that you shot yourself.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** And you're like, I am.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:17]** That was dumb.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:18]** That was dumb.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:20]** Quick fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:23]** Why did I do that?

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:24]** Damn it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:29]** It's definitely that meme of you pouring sand through your hand being like, why am I called quick fire?

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:31]** I just shot myself.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:33]** Great Owens!

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:34]** Ravens!

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:40]** All right, Dr. Okay, let's see if you are going to break the thing that was already broken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:44]** Yeah, no, it got broken, so I don't have to worry about it anymore.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:50]** But the thing that I was going to say is I attuned my custom micro lab to AstroZone.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]** Yes, you did.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:56]** When we were back before interrogating and talking to the guy.

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:59]** In the before times, Trostenec Cup.

**[01:03:59 - 01:03:59]** Yeah.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:08]** And then so I don't have to roll for a ranged attack for the special property of my custom micro lab.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:08]** All right.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** Until I bring in an injection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:12]** Well done.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:14]** So I can just inject them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:16]** You're just going to inject them?

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** Like auto targets?

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:17]** Is that what you're saying?

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** I guess, yeah.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** Okay.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:19]** Inject them.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:20]** They're not taken.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** Yeah.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** Yeah.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:26]** That's what he's saying is it would have automatically hit the real sneaky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:32]** Well, yes, but I feel like, oh, but it's not an attack roll.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:34]** So, yeah, I guess he would have hit.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** Unfortunately, that's not what's happening anymore.

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:37]** So, what are you going to do?

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:39]** But that is a good deep dive.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:40]** Good deep dive.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:41]** That's fine.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:43]** That would have been awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:43]** All right.

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:52]** So I'm going to pull out my... Let's see what this semi-auto pistol can do.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:55]** So I'm going to draw and fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:56]** Draw and fire.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:58]** Give me the fire.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:00]** Give me that roll.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:02]** They cannot move.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:06]** And I believe... How long are they flat-footed from your trick attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:09]** You're not going to fucking believe this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:11]** Wait, what happened?

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:12]** I just 20'd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:15]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:17]** It will never happen again, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:18]** You just yeeted them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:21]** I just yeeted twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:21]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:22]** That automatically hits.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:29]** How long are they flat-footed, Nick, by the way, from your trick attack?

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:31]** She's no longer flat-footed.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:31]** No longer.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:32]** Got it.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:32]** Okay, cool.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:35]** All right, give me that double damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:51]** roll twice and they're burning i think oh i think it's just the it's the um projectile one it's okay piercing damage projectile yeah yeah how much damage okay so it's six points six points of damage

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:51]** Wow.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:52]** Not a lot.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:54]** Not a lump, but maybe enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:56]** But good enough.

**[01:05:56 - 01:06:04]** They still seem like they're up, and even as they're hit, they don't appear to really move too much because they are dazed.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:06]** They don't even seem to register the pain.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** Well done.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:09]** You want to do anything else with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:11]** I think that's it because I drew the weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** That is true.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:12]** I can't.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:14]** You did draw the weapon.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:15]** All right.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:20]** Rick, can you believe...

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:29]** That Godwina raises her cuffed hands from behind her back.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:31]** Yes, you're right.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:34]** Instead, what is she going to do?

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:36]** Thank you for reminding me.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:41]** She is cuffed, but I believe she's going to pick up her foot and attack you.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:42]** She's hardy.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:44]** What does she get?

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:45]** Here's the thing.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:46]** Here is the thing.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** I don't think any of this is going to go through.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:56]** Because I want to see if she's going to attack you, though, because she would probably do this any way.

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:57]** She does not miss.

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:59]** This is your idea, Nick.

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:00]** She does not miss.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:08]** She picks up her foot and she kicks out at you and her foot is just too short and just misses, lands right in front of you.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:15]** So instead, she is just going to use that moment, kind of stagger a little bit, and then start to run.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:18]** You get an attack of opportunity as she runs away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:22]** Is that with my... I have a ranged weapon that still gets me attack and opportunity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:24]** Yeah, I think so.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:25]** Would it not?

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:27]** You get an attack and opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:31]** Oh, Kelly, should I just kill her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:34]** No, you should not do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:34]** Natural 20.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:40]** But I'm going to do it.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:45]** There we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:46]** Holy crap.

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:48]** This is the episode of

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:51]** Multiple 20s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:53]** Yeah, this is a crazy episode.

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:55]** All right, give me your damage.

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:57]** Does this weapon have a critical skill?

**[01:07:58 - 01:08:01]** I think it has a critical skill, so I don't roll twice then.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:04]** Or I roll twice and then use a critical skill?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:04]** Yeah.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:07]** It has critical effects that are in addition to, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:08]** Yep.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:09]** To double damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:10]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:11]** Oh, okay.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:12]** So then that's it.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:12]** What's the weapon?

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:14]** Hellcannon?

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:19]** It's going to be my laser, azimuth laser, artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:19]** Okay.

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:20]** So I'm tied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:23]** So that's one point of damage.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:26]** Eight points of damage.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:27]** So nine points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:36]** Yeah, but I will say that as she starts to run, you hit her in the back and she falls forward on top of this treadmill thing and just falls face down into the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:38]** Just like reactionary.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:40]** As soon as she starts moving, he just twists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:42]** Swings, does it.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:43]** She dies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:44]** No, I did say non-lethal.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:46]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** Yeah, you did say that.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:49]** Okay, all right.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:51]** Then she is unconscious.

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:53]** Whew, scared me.

**[01:08:53 - 01:09:17]** yeah thank you rick wow so she is now unconscious again here's just like looks over like really scared and then kind of relaxes it's like all right kind of relaxes like all right it's fine it's fine wow she tried to run she couldn't lozu's turn lozu is still unconscious across the room rick it's your turn now what are you doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:22]** And then he's just going to cock it back one more time and then fire at Lozu.

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:24]** Not at Lozu.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:30]** But I did ask last round which one this was.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:31]** Did they not respond?

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:33]** Oh, it's not their turn.

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:34]** Well, it was their turn in between.

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:36]** Oh, but they're dazed.

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:37]** They can't respond.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:39]** They can't respond.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:39]** Until their next turn.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:41]** I knew that the whole time.

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:43]** So Rick is going to shoot.

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:44]** It's a 19.

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:45]** Okay.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:46]** Not quite a critical.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:48]** It's 19 plus 7.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:49]** That's a hit.

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:49]** It's a 26 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:50]** That is a hit.

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:51]** Come on, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:53]** You're just shooting fish in a barrel here.

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:54]** How much damage?

**[01:09:54 - 01:09:56]** That's a max damage of 10 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:57]** Wow.

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:58]** Okay.

**[01:09:58 - 01:10:02]** You see them and they don't even react again.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:13]** But you can tell that the wound on anybody else, they'd be screaming in pain from that because that just totally took out some of their sides and left so much damage to them.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:16]** Wow, Hears, what are you going to do?

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:18]** You going to wrap this up?

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:20]** You going to wrap this frustrating fight up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:21]** Yeah, Hears is going to do that.

**[01:10:22 - 01:10:25]** And he's going to walk towards Notlozu.

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:26]** Uh-huh.

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:30]** As she's standing there and look her right in the eyes.

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:35]** And then take his dueling sword and just thrust it into her chest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:36]** Oh!

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:38]** Wow!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:41]** Wow.

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:41]** Roll four.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:44]** So that's... Attack.

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:47]** For attack, that's... Oh, jeez.

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:48]** It's a four.

**[01:10:49 - 01:10:50]** It's a four?

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:51]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:56]** Something about it, she doesn't even try and move.

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:59]** The way you stepped up, it just misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:01]** Cut your eye just right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:03]** Yeah, just right.

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:04]** Oh, man.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:07]** Wait, so I have to roll four?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:07]** Okay, got it.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:08]** To hit.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:08]** You missed.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:09]** Yeah, my hit roll hit.

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:10]** Missed, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:12]** Yep, just flat out.

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:13]** There are no more clones.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:14]** It just missed.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:16]** Round four.

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:19]** It is Sabrina's turn.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:21]** She continues to sit.

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:24]** Not Lozu, continues to daze.

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:25]** She's smart.

**[01:11:26 - 01:11:28]** Nico, what are you doing on your turn here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:31]** Nico is going to do a trick attack.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:32]** All right.

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:35]** So Nico's going to do a trick attack, and he's going to try to end this.

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:36]** Okay.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:41]** Give me the DC 23.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:43]** I didn't get it.

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:44]** Okay.

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:45]** You don't get it.

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:46]** That's all right.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:47]** No worries.

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:49]** I got a 19 total on the roll.

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:51]** It was a nine plus eight.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:51]** Okay.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:51]** That's fine.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:52]** It was 11 plus eight.

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:53]** Sorry.

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:53]** That's fine.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:55]** And then you make your attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:57 - 01:12:01]** That's 11 to hit on EAC.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:01]** That does not hit.

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:03]** Fires.

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:05]** Once again, sometimes just moves.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:11]** First the katana, and then the bolt just flies by.

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:12]** Wow.

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:12]** Wow.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:13]** So close.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:13]** Dr.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:14]** O.K., what are you doing here?

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:15]** What are you doing here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:16]** Oh, man.

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:20]** Yeah.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:22]** I thought this would have been over by now, I suppose.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:23]** Yeah, weird.

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:26]** So, they're like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:55]** kind of i have to move right in order can i yeah there would be soft cover if you wanted to shoot yeah so here yeah that's fine you're fine so rick and here's here's this right in front of not lozu rick is a few feet behind sabrina a few feet behind rick dr k steps to the south about 10 feet 5 10 feet can take a shot yeah let's fire again with the uh semi-auto okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:56 - 01:12:56]** Pistol.

**[01:12:57 - 01:12:57]** Pistol?

**[01:12:57 - 01:12:59]** The sort of antiquated weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:02]** For the sophisticated age.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:03]** Whoa.

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:06]** Big old four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:08]** Four.

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:11]** I don't know what it is.

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:16]** But this not Lozu is not dying.

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:16]** And you know what?

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:18]** I'm kind of happy about it.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:22]** Although, to be honest, I think there are, oh, I don't know, eight more rounds of being dazed.

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:25]** So I don't think her luck is going to last this long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:28]** The situation's only one round.

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:30]** It's only one round, though.

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:31]** It's one minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:31]** Sadly.

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:36]** No, it's one round, and then she's immune to it for one minute thereafter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:37 - 01:13:38]** You are right.

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:42]** Wait, so then that means that she would have gone this turn because she already had it from last time, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:45]** No, that was a higher initiative, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:47]** You are not higher in initiative.

**[01:13:47 - 01:13:48]** Oh, wait.

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:49]** Then her?

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:49]** No, you're not.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:51]** So she would have gone.

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:52]** Oh.

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:52]** Oh, well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:57]** I thought here's dazed her after I went last time.

**[01:13:57 - 01:13:59]** And so she was only one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:59 - 01:14:00]** Oh, you're right.

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:02]** So then this is the round that she's dazed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:02 - 01:14:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:03 - 01:14:04]** Yeah, you're super duper right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:05]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:05 - 01:14:07]** The next round she will act.

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:10]** Okay, Dr. K missed.

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:12]** And respond to my question.

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:13]** Yeah, fine.

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:15]** Kim's just like, I really want the question.

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:17]** We're all like, all right, can we find out?

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:19]** It is Lucy's turn.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:20]** She's unconscious.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:22]** Rick, it is your turn.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:22]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:26]** Do you want to find out the answer to the question or not?

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:27]** Yes.

**[01:14:29 - 01:14:30]** What does that mean?

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:33]** I don't know what that means.

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:42]** Rick is going to stomp over to one, two, three, four.

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:42]** Yeah.

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:43]** To there.

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:52]** He's in the process is going to drop his azimuth artillery laser down over behind him.

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:58]** and draw out the giant tactical greataxe that he just picked up.

**[01:14:58 - 01:15:02]** And he's going to swing it.

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:03]** Okay.

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:04]** With all of his might.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:06]** Okay.

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:07 - 01:15:13]** Oh, a natural.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:13]** A natural one.

**[01:15:14 - 01:15:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:20]** I'm sorry.

**[01:15:20 - 01:15:21]** I'm really close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:23]** Can we finish this fight, please?

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:25]** What is happening right now?

**[01:15:25 - 01:15:28]** We're just wildly swinging all the way around her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:31]** It makes kind of weird sense, right?

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:34]** That we would have one round that's super awesome.

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:36]** And then a bunch of rounds that are not.

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:37]** All right, Kev, tell me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:38 - 01:15:39]** One, two, three, two, one.

**[01:15:39 - 01:15:40]** I'm going to flip.

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:40]** Oh, stop.

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:41]** Just take the top.

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:42]** Top guard.

**[01:15:42 - 01:15:43]** There's a melee weapon.

**[01:15:44 - 01:15:45]** So much blood.

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:48]** Reroll the attack against your original target.

**[01:15:48 - 01:15:53]** If the attack hits, it is a critical hit, but you are sickened for 3d4 rounds.

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:55]** That's actually kind of interesting.

**[01:15:55 - 01:15:55]** That's kind of good.

**[01:15:56 - 01:15:57]** It didn't hit.

**[01:15:57 - 01:15:58]** Oh, it doesn't hit?

**[01:15:59 - 01:16:01]** I got 12 to hit.

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:03]** 12 against KAC?

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:04]** With KAC.

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:06]** Yeah, that does not hit.

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:07]** Wow.

**[01:16:07 - 01:16:07]** So I'm not sickened either?

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:09]** No, you're not sickened.

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:09]** You're good.

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:10]** Oh, good.

**[01:16:10 - 01:16:11]** Yeah, so something happened.

**[01:16:12 - 01:16:13]** You were a little off balance.

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:15]** Things just were not right.

**[01:16:15 - 01:16:19]** Who knows what it was.

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:21]** I'm sickened by this game.

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:22]** Wow, rude.

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:23]** Wow.

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:24]** I would not appreciate that.

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:25]** You're just sickened by this session.

**[01:16:26 - 01:16:27]** Session, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:27 - 01:16:28]** Here, what are you doing on your turn?

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:30]** Come on, finish this thing, man.

**[01:16:30 - 01:16:32]** I don't think it's my turn again already, is it?

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:33]** It was just Rick's turn.

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:34]** Yeah, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:35 - 01:16:35]** We're going.

**[01:16:35 - 01:16:36]** Come on, we're moving to combat.

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:37]** All right.

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:38]** It's your turn.

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:40]** Did we agree that we're killing this?

**[01:16:40 - 01:16:43]** Because, like, Kevin, you don't want the answers anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:45]** I don't care.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:46]** All right, fair enough.

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:48]** Well, Rick doesn't want to kill anybody.

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:48]** Let's see if you do.

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:52]** Here's is going to stab her again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:55]** Stab down at not Lozu again.

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:56]** At not Lozu.

**[01:16:56 - 01:16:58]** Also, she's flanked, right?

**[01:17:00 - 01:17:01]** No, flank has to be opposite.

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:02]** Yeah, opposites.

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:02]** Oh, right.

**[01:17:03 - 01:17:03]** Yeah, opposites.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:04 - 01:17:05]** All right.

**[01:17:05 - 01:17:10]** And I also have this thing called communalism, which Sharons have.

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:16]** And as they're used to working together in a team once per day, if an ally is within 10 feet,

**[01:17:16 - 01:17:19]** I can roll a single attack roll again.

**[01:17:19 - 01:17:20]** Beautiful.

**[01:17:20 - 01:17:22]** So I'm going to do that just in case it fails.

**[01:17:22 - 01:17:22]** All right.

**[01:17:22 - 01:17:24]** So I rolled a one.

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:26]** So I'm definitely going to roll that again.

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:26]** Fail.

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:27]** Fail.

**[01:17:27 - 01:17:28]** And an eight.

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:28]** Oh, my.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:31]** Does an eight save yourself from a critical failure?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:33]** An eight plus what?

**[01:17:33 - 01:17:34]** An eight plus what?

**[01:17:34 - 01:17:35]** An eight plus what?

**[01:17:36 - 01:17:37]** Like an eight total?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:37 - 01:17:38]** Oh, it's like a plus one.

**[01:17:39 - 01:17:39]** Yeah.

**[01:17:39 - 01:17:40]** Okay.

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:42]** So what is that, a nine then?

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:44]** You miss.

**[01:17:45 - 01:17:46]** You miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:17:46 - 01:17:47]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:48]** Oh, my God.

**[01:17:48 - 01:17:49]** Didn't you get to roll again?

**[01:17:49 - 01:17:50]** I did.

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:52]** He already rolled a one, and then he rolled an eight.

**[01:17:52 - 01:17:54]** Oh, he rolled an eight.

**[01:17:54 - 01:17:55]** All righty.

**[01:17:55 - 01:17:58]** It is a top of, I believe, round five.

**[01:17:59 - 01:18:05]** Sabrina continues to twiddle her thumbs, but interestingly, not Lozu.

**[01:18:06 - 01:18:15]** Coming out of the daze, snaps her head, and then just takes a big sigh.

**[01:18:18 - 01:18:19]** And just takes her hand.

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:20]** Cast mirror image.

**[01:18:20 - 01:18:23]** Yeah, then casts holographic clone.

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:27]** And then just takes their hands and says...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:30]** I am WEM.

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:32]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:34]** There's more of these things?


## Speaker_0

**[01:18:36 - 01:18:36]** WEM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:41 - 01:18:42]** Can you believe it?

**[01:18:42 - 01:18:51]** 25 episodes of laughter, of tender moments, of heart-pounding moments, of frustrating moments, all because of you.

**[01:18:51 - 01:18:52]** So thank you, listener.

**[01:18:53 - 01:18:54]** You've been here through all of it.

**[01:18:54 - 01:18:56]** Tell your game table.

**[01:18:56 - 01:18:57]** Tell your friends.

**[01:18:57 - 01:18:58]** Tell your family.

**[01:18:58 - 01:18:59]** Tell that person on the street.

**[01:18:59 - 01:19:01]** Say, hey, listen to Woolsey.

**[01:19:01 - 01:19:02]** Right, and that voice.

**[01:19:03 - 01:19:10]** Invite everyone you can to come join us at the table to play some Starfinder and maybe try out Starfinder themselves.

**[01:19:11 - 01:19:12]** Here's to 25 more.

**[01:19:13 - 01:19:16]** We'll see you next We'll Save Wednesday.
