## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Last time on We'll Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:09]** After all this time, strife, and build-up, the group encounter the elusive Algiada.

**[00:00:09 - 00:00:13]** She starts blaming others' wrongdoing and playing the victim.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:18]** She also admits to helping the pirates attempt to steal a valuable relic.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:21]** She's quickly revealed when Dr. O.K.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:24]** discovers her pirate cohorts waiting in ambush.

**[00:00:25 - 00:00:29]** Algiada attacks and finds her end at the hands of Dr.

**[00:00:29 - 00:00:30]** O.K.,

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:39]** Our group's attention is then drawn toward Hears finally moving toward the long-sought relic with the glowing object now in his possession.

**[00:00:40 - 00:00:42]** What is the nature of this relic?

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:44]** What will be the fate of the ship?

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on... We'll See!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** Hey, actually, real quick.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:43]** Hey, can we go over our super secret rules before recording starts?

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Because I need a refresher.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** I was just looking through my notes.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:54]** It says one of them is that we only eat creamy peanut butter before sessions and that the other is that you laugh at all my jokes.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** What are the others?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** Who put those in there?

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:59]** That's not... You're looking at something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:01]** Am I looking at a different set of super secrets?

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** I thought it was Jif peanut butter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** Special shout out to Jif.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** I've been eating crunchy.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:05]** Is that a problem?

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:07]** Because I really thought it was just regular...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:10]** Well, I thought that those were the super secret rules.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** Am I wrong?

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** What about the people with the peanut allergies?

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** Well, they can have cashew butter, right?

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:18]** Oh, well, I guess cashew is a peanut.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** Ew.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** It's gross.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:19]** Almonds?

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** Are almonds peanuts?

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** You don't call them peanuts.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** It's so dry, though.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:24]** Almond butter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** That's enough out of the peanut gallery.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Is that a punishment?

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:30]** I don't know, but guys, we're recording.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** We're recording?

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Oh, shit.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:36]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** What's up, episode 28?

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** How we doing?

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** It's good.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** Kev's got his Dr. Pepper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** Will's got his... I didn't know we were improv-ing to start it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:49]** Well, you know, I was just trying to yes and us a little bit, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** Oh, my mistake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:51]** Oh, it's cool.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** It's all good.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** That's completely inappropriate.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:55]** Like, what the hell were you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** Hey, prompt us, because the first thing I did was say no.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** Well, I thought that you guys were going to yes and me, but it's fine.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:06]** I'm looking at our... Because we have a Google Doc that has all of our...

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:27]** your own jokes and rules and stuff and i'm like wait i don't see peanut butter anywhere on this the search option's not working well maybe i didn't share access with you kev because you're not privy to the super secret rules i created the document just can you create every document this is a real thing i thought you can't handle the truth you can't handle the super secret rules


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:28]** Yes, it's a real document.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:31]** Now I feel really, really left out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** It's an invite only.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** You can only get only certain people are invited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** Who else is in this, by the way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:41]** I don't think I am because it looks like I just made my own document then and called it Super Secret Rules and I didn't invite anybody, so I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:44]** Yes, and you decided not to invite anybody.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** I guess it was just me then.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Oh, here's the link to it right here.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** It was just me.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** We got a lot of things to go over.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** You can find the rules on the dark web.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** Oh, yeah, this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:05]** So far, the only actual house rules that we have right now is our rule of punishments, which is pun with P-U-N.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:08]** Capitalized.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:11]** If somebody makes a good enough pun, the five of us vote on it.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:19]** And if majority rules, then they get a plus one to either an attack roll or a hit to hit roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** That's the same thing.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** You mean attack roll or skill check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** Go ahead and look at next.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:23]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** I thought it was just a plus one.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** It's a plus one to any roll, right?

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:28]** So you can do attack roll or damage is what I meant.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:32]** Or skill check or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:33]** Sorry.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** Sorry, Will.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:37]** What was his idea?

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** Will, you're like a little quiet.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:43]** Go ahead, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:43 - 00:05:00]** So the second house rule that we have is that non-lethal magic missiles, whenever Kelly's character hears, tries to do it, he has to roll a D100, and it's got a 50-50 chance of being a lethal shot instead of non-lethal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:00]** I love it.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]** You have to remember to do this.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** It's so messed up.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** That's why we have the doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** It's pretty messed up.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** So you try to do non-lethal and then accidentally kill him as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:11]** Yeah, I mean, I think it's perfect for a spell that you don't have to roll an attack for and automatically hits.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:14]** Note to self, we should seriously hire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** Kevin doesn't want to win.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** That's what it all comes down to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:19]** I just want to play by the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:21]** It's not a rule, it's our rule.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** Yeah, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:25]** There was something I did want to bring up.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** I figured out a page it's on.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** The Coup de Grace.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** Coup de Grasse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** Coup de Grasse?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:58]** two to Gracie that's where you get coup de grace by a member of the Gracie family you get choked down well whenever we go to like whenever Nick goes to just kill a random person that he doesn't like that we have a random hostage that we have captured then we shouldn't just kill them we have to roll for a coup de grace I think coup de grace is fine yeah coup de grace it's different I think it's coup de crap


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** Wow.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:04]** No, I think you're talking about... Wow, Nick.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** Thanks.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:05]** Thanks.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:06]** All right.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:11]** Well, while you're looking it up, we do have things that we got to go through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** We're talking about a full action Coup de Grace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:21]** We're talking about the fact that Kelly should have on in last session, episode 27...

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:29]** Kelly, rather, Hears released the awesome power of the Electrovor Pokemon.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** Only found.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:33]** It's our Pokemon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** It's getting ready to do an evolution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** I got it, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:38]** Yeah, it's a rare space thing.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:38]** Hold on, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:42]** I think your thing is Kudogra is something different than this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** Okay.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:49]** Well, the point is, that Electrovor, I Coup de Grace that Electrovor on the turn that it should have acted.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:53]** And that was the fact, that it should have acted on the same turn that you threw it.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:57]** Slight thing, but I'm sure you will use it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** Can we reset it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:21]** the like 30 seconds that it was out there then i think it was it's good for like six rounds yeah i think it spent like six seconds so it was there for six seconds so you still have uh whatever the total length of my time minus six seconds you could just reset it maybe since it didn't get to go 10 rounds because we're not going that far i'm not that benevolent kelly

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:22]** Fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:23]** Fine.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** Fine.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:25]** Fine.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** You still used it.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** It just could have acted.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:31]** For being real, he did create a super secret document and didn't find any of us.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** How's that for true to crap?

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** It was titled super secret, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** It was titled super secret, yeah.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** Yeah.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:40]** Kev, you have something to say about the non-existent coup de grace?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** No, it's real.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** It's right there in the book.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:43]** Pitch 248.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:45]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:50]** It says coup de grace, however that's pronounced in whatever language it's supposed to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:53]** Bon appétit.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** French.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Yeah, it's French.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:55]** R-A-S.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:58]** Well, if it was French, it would be Grasse.

**[00:07:59 - 00:07:59]** Yes.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:03]** Because you would pronounce the C since there's a vowel after it.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** I'd have to double check that.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:07]** It's been a long time since I took any French classes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Coup de Grasse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:15]** Anyways, it says, as a full action, you can deliver a special attack called, damn it, the same word, Coup de Grasse.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:41]** uh to an adjacent helpless opponent you automatically hit and score a critical hit if the target survives the damage he must succeed at a fortitude saving throw a dc equals 10 plus your level or cr or die however if the target is immune to critical hits the coup de grace does not deal critical damage and effects nor does it force the target to succeed at a saving throw or dice


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:46]** So it is exactly what it is in every other sense.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** And every other use of that word, it is the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** What a word.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** I've never heard that word used before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** It is exactly that.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** It is a killing blow.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:58]** It is the idea that somebody is unconscious and they are helpless and they cannot do anything.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:01]** And you go over and take their life, whether it's merciful or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** It's like an argument.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:07]** If you, like, win the argument in an amazing way, that was, like, your coup de grace or whatever the hell it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:07]** I didn't know that.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** That's interesting.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** The final killing point.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** The final blow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:20]** Anyways, all I'm saying is whenever we have hostages and Nico decides to take them out before we leave the room, he has to do this instead of just saying they're dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:20]** All right.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** Nico, your thoughts?

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** It's interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:23]** I think that's crap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** No, it's gra.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:28]** It's not coup de crap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** Oh, it's coup de crap.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** Yeah, it's coup de gra.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:34]** The G sounds like an R or a C. Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** All right, we got something else big coming.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** Ba-ba-ba-roll off.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** Ba-ba-ba-ba.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:43]** Different from a coup d'etat.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** Coup d'etat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** We are rolling.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Well, not we.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:50]** You all are rolling for the Starfinder backpack.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** Show us behind door number two, Kelly.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** Da-da-da-da.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** Hey, everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** This is a Star Wars.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:58]** I mean, a Starfinder backpack.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** It's a Starfinder backpack.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** It can hold many things.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:04]** It came with Pokemon inside of it, but that does not come with the backpack.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Just full disclosure.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** Yep.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:06]** A few other things.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** Yep.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:07]** But what do you think?

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:08]** Roll off?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** Who wants to roll off?

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** So how are we performing this roll off?

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** Just roll a D20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** You grab a D20.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** Your favorite D20.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** And whoever wants it, it's going to roll off.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:18]** No modifiers.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:19]** Highest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:48]** highest one gets to uh gets the bag i mean i say we do this safari zone style i say we do this safari zone style here where we just whoever throws the most bait and catches it wild gets it i don't know what that means yeah what does that mean i think i was going with the pokemon reference okay okay okay what did we decide that by a roll wait is there bait for pokemon


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:53]** Yeah, you go to Safari Zone, you're not allowed to use your starting Pokemon.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:56]** You have to actually throw bait or throw rocks.

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:00]** Which, to be honest, I think promotes animal abuse, but whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:03]** Well, the whole show is all about the animal abuse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** Yeah, so deep.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** That's a separate episode.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** Nick, what did you roll?

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** Because Will rolled something.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:11]** Kevin rolled something.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** Kelly, are you rolling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:16]** No, because I'm assuming that I'm keeping the Electrophore.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** I...

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** I'm assuming.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Please.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:22]** So then, like... He basically keeps the Electrobor.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:22]** No.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:26]** He has the Electrobor in his pocket and he's just like...

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:30]** being like, ah, here's the bag, kind of just distracting everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** He's not going to roll for it.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:32]** Where'd that monster thing go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** Where'd that monster thing go?

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** To be fair.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:35]** I'm assuming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** If you're going to do that, please.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** The pirate has some.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** The pirate has some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:45]** All right, here's the electrovore, because finders keepers, but the bag is up for grabs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Nico, what did you roll?

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** I'm not rolling for this.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** You're not rolling for the bag?

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:50]** All right.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:52]** It's just between Dr. OK and Rick.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** Rick doesn't get it.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:54]** What a big roll.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:55]** A one.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:56]** Oh.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:58]** Oh.

**[00:11:59 - 00:11:59]** Oh.

**[00:11:59 - 00:11:59]** Yeah.

**[00:11:59 - 00:11:59]** Wow.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:00]** No.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:00]** Okay.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:03]** I don't think so.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** Take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** Take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Yeah.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** I don't want it anyways.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** Dr. Okay gets the Starfinder backpack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** Because I don't like the Starfinders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Fascinating.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:17]** This will fit many potions and chemicals to assist you all in combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** And lots of slime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:29]** plenty of room for slime and you can also carry my both three weapons i don't think it's it's a i i don't think it's a bag of holding


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:33]** Well, it raises your encumbrance by four.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:33]** It does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** But I don't know if the weapon can fit in this little book bag.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** I don't know about that.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** It's a haversack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:41]** It just says it changes your encumbrance.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:42]** All right.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:46]** It doesn't change dimension to fit whatever goes in it like a bag of gold.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** No, it just makes you stronger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:48]** Stronger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:49]** Better.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** Faster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:50]** Come on.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:52]** We're talking Skyrim rules here, John.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** Come on.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** Skyrim.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** Skyrim.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** Skyrim.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:54]** We are.

**[00:12:54 - 00:13:01]** Welcome to episode 28 of We'll Save the Skyrim Starfinder podcast, where we play Skyrim and Starfinder at the same time.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** None of this is true.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** None of this is true.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:06]** All right, Nick, you had a question that I liked.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:07]** It was good.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:12]** I think you should pose it since it was your question and your characters will answer it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:13]** Oh, boy.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:14]** Okay.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:17]** Well, the question, it's...

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:24]** I've been seeing a meme going around the internet, a Star Wars meme, that goes a little bit like this.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:27]** And I like the question, because it's really badass.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:32]** You're getting ready to go and make your run on the Death Star Trench.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** You're turning up the volume.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** What song is playing?

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:43]** If we're putting it in layman's terms, what is your ultimate psych-up song?

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:43]** For your character.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** Player or character?

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:50]** Preferably character, but if the player would also like to inform as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:56]** Well, characters, I mean, we can't just reference a song from today.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:59]** I mean, there was The Gap, and it's an alternative universe.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** You could do it.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:00]** You could do it.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:01]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** There's archaeological references, okay?

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:05]** Yeah.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:11]** There was a portal where a bunch of iPods were discovered from a parallel universe.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:14]** And they all had downloaded stuff from Napster.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** Frostwire.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:18]** Napster and LimeWire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:19]** LimeWire.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:22]** Films from the 1900s of Earth time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:25]** Nico does reference a lot of free gap things.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:28]** Nico says Kazaa, personally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** Kazaa.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** Nico's saying, don't be hatin'.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** I had the money to do it.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** Nico is rich.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:40]** Nico, what is your hype-up song?

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** I would say Danger Zone.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** Danger Zone.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:45]** Danger Zone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** I love it.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Oh man, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:53]** Fun story about this one was whenever we pulled into Guam, we had to watch a video about riptides.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:56]** And the title of the video is Danger Zone.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:04]** And we would literally count how many times they said the words Danger Zone in reference to riptides.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:08]** And I think the total count was like 65 times in a 15-minute video.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** Is it a drinking game?

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** Yeah.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Sounds like it's dangerous.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:15]** You're not drinking it all in crew's mess on the ship before you leave it.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** So no, it's not a drinking game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** That's unfortunate.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** Also, riptides are scary.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:19]** Please be safe.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:20]** Watch out.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** And learn how to swim.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** Danger zone.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** Danger zone.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Danger zone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** Next.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** All right.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Whose song?

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:30]** I'll try like, so I don't really have a favorite song.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:32]** I really do like the Pokemon theme.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** So that would be a great one.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** That would be a great one to fly down.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:37]** But I'm looking at treasure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:40]** My recently liked songs, I guess it's the only reference point I can have.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:45]** So the most recent one is on Spotify, Sugar Sugar by the Archies.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:50]** The one that goes, sing with my candy girl.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** And you got me wanting you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:55]** That'd be a terrible one.

**[00:15:55 - 00:16:00]** I can totally see you being in the middle of combat here as you just put in some AirPods and that starts playing.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** It's very Guardians of the Galaxy.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** It's very Star Wars.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** R2, can you lock it down back there?

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Oh, sugar.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** Honey, honey.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** They're all over me.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:15]** I can't take them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:20]** And now it's for the segment where we have Nick recreate a scene from Star Wars by memory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** No, but I refuse this.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** It's got to be the Pokemon theme.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:25]** It's probably that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:25]** For sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:34]** I will find it and make sure it plays right after you said that.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** Cause it's beautiful.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:36]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:37]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Rick.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:50]** I mean, I know I don't have Spotify playlists on my computer right now for what I actually listened to, but I feel like, um, I don't know.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:57]** Maybe, like, Dr. OK would be into, like, some Billy Idol or something.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:01]** Like, something aggressive, but not, like, metal.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:03]** But, like, you know, punk-ish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** Oh, I think I said Billy Eilish.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** Billy Idol.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:08]** Gotcha.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** Same thing.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** Neither works.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** Oh, is it?

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:14]** I haven't... I need to be educated on music.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:14]** Neither works.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** They're like the same.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** Billie Eilish.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:20]** During combat, you just start kicking things.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:22]** You just start tearing the room apart.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** You just start washing.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:27]** The beds look...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:50]** it's so good well that's not fair for talking about spotify because the only things i actually have on my spotify are we'll save the podcast oh yeah who listens to that my favorite band night market starring john swan hey five minutes of listening


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:57]** I don't know what you're talking about.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:57]** Baby shark.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:58]** Don't do that, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** Don't do that, Nick.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:00]** Stop.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** It's going to be in all our heads now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:12]** If Rick was actually getting into a tense situation where he needed focus, he would probably flick the switch and the Hallelujah song would play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:15]** Like, I don't do chorus.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:16]** Yep.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:16]** Wow.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:16]** Hallelujah.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** Like Leonard Cohen.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:17]** Hallelujah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:21]** Like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:32]** You're talking about the song by... He would use that to calm his nerves and focus deep on whatever is grabbing his attention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** I'd like to change my answer.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:36]** Maybe the Flight of the Valkyrie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** I had a feeling Dr. O.K.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** was classical.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** I just had a feeling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:42]** It made sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:44]** Flight of the Bumblebee it is.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:49]** I kind of want to have an episode where every time you all take a turn, we just play your theme music.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:53]** So I will note this down and then we'll do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:55]** Oh, I'm so excited for that.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** Oh, I'm so excited.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:59]** Something from like Hall of the Mountain King.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Hall of the Mountain King.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:04]** Wasn't Nick working on theme music for each of us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:06]** Nick does have theme music for each of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Yeah.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:09]** Waiting to drop that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:13]** And now we have some contemporary stuff as well.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:15]** Yes, indeedy.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:17]** Yes, indeedy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Yes, and Deedee's.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:22]** Yes, and Deedee's.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** Not good enough for punishment.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** That's my vote.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** That's my vote.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:26]** Sorry, Kev.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** That's what I voted on, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** All right, so one last question.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** Do you know the Muffin Man?

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:37]** When you listen back to starting episode one, that is a question for another day, Nick.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:40]** A very important one that we will all get to.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:41]** Don't you worry.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** Don't you worry.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:53]** Now, my question is, in the we'll say bingo that we all play, who had pirates taking over the Chimera to loot everything and possibly steal the relic?

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:58]** I feel like that was Nico at one point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:00]** Nico definitely calls it out in, I think, episode eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** So does Hears, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** Yeah.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:03]** Was it eight?

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** I forget what episode it is.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:06]** But yeah, we're like, oh, man.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** It was whatever the power goes out.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:11]** And then we're like, oh, man, what's happening?

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** And actually, it's not Nico.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** It's Nick that says it.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:17]** Nick's like, oh, man, it's probably pirates.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:18]** Good call, Nick.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** Good call.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** Impressive, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** Impressive.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** Oh, so here's also called it out.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:25]** I don't recall, but that could be because he's all pirating, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** Yeah.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** Classic pirate move.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:29]** Your pirate senses were going off.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:33]** I'm around on Saturdays and Sundays for autographs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:40]** Saturdays between 2 and 6 are typical times when we are recording.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:42]** So if you come around, you'll just be on the recording.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:45]** So if that's the thing that you want to do, just come by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** I use Sharpie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:46]** I like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** Plan accordingly.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** You guys ready to jump in?

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** You guys ready to do the do?

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** Yes!

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:54]** I get a point.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** Yes!


## Speaker_0

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:56]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:01]** I don't think you get punishment just because Kevin was doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:02]** All right.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:02]** Hold on.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:03]** Hold on.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:09]** Here's one more secret rule that I would like to propose to the group.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:09]** Okay.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:16]** On road trips, I used to play this game with my family all the time where I'd start humming a song that I found was catchy in my head at the time.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:19]** And I would give myself a point.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:23]** If I got someone else in the car to sing it within five minutes.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:25]** I got it stuck in someone else's head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:25]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** So you get a point.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:32]** We don't know if that point's worthless.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** The points are made up and they don't mean anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** Is the point available to anyone?

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:42]** So if I start humming something and then you finish it, I get a point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** That's right.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** But you guys are all missing the point.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:49]** Hey, hey, hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** We'll save everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** Kevin Decker.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:58]** So, like, for example, I started singing Baby Shark and, like, five minutes later, Kev's singing Baby Shark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:01]** Intentionally, because you did it.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:04]** If this game existed, I would avoid it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:05]** Of course.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** I got a second in your head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:09]** I'm never going to repeat anything that makes sense.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:11]** He's always just stealing points from me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:14]** We're just going to be silent when you talk, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:18]** That's so rude!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** Alright, I'm signing off.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** Bye, guys.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:31]** The joke is also, I want my song to be Everybody Have Funk Tonight by Wang Chan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** Okay.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** I like it.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:33]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** That's a good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** I haven't heard that one.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:39]** Well, speaking of poor transitions, you guys ready?

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** Yeah.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:40]** Let's do it.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:41]** Let's do it.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:42]** Last session.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:46]** You finally found Algiata E.M.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:49]** in the poor cargo bay.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:55]** Haggard clearly hadn't slept or eaten for...

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:18]** an undisclosed amount of time but as she approaches uh warning of the secret plot of the captain to take over the ship then lozu and the party you all feel conflicted is this the real lozu knowing what you know of the shape-shifting astrozoans is this the real sorry is this the real algiata

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:27]** And Dr. OK certainly finds a solution by stumbling upon a space pirate in the corner.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:35]** And the sudden surprise causes Algiata to plunge a dagger into Rick-19's leg.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** And the veil is lifted.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:42]** And in your sixth battle of the day.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:44]** Sixth.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:46]** The battle is hard fought.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:46]** Busy crew.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:47]** Busy crew.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:48]** It was hard fought.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** Nico almost goes down.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:55]** Hears discovers a powerful item that conjures an electric wolf Pokemon.

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:01]** And Rick, Dr. OK, makes some consistent powerful hits as they gave everything they got.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:07]** Even Lozu, feeling betrayed, slams Algiata against a crate in anger.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:11]** And a space pirate, Billy, one day away from retirement, falls.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:15]** While Algiata, trying to move away, walks into Dr.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:15]** O.K.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:18]** 's, I believe it was your costa injector, right?

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** You shot her with that?

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** Yeah.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:20]** She dies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:21]** She dies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:26]** So, turns out maybe Algiata was not the Algiata.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:27]** The real Algiata.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:38]** Now, in the aftermath, here's... You finish your collecting that you did mid-combat, and in which you found this Starfinder book bag, now property of Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:39]** And looking good.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:43]** Thank you for the splendid...

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:48]** vessel for potions and healing and things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:51]** I feel like that was a tug of war between you and Rick.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:54]** And Rick rolled a one, so Rick was like, eh, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Talk about tug of wars.

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:00]** Didn't even pick up the rope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:03]** Well, then, I appreciate your sacrifice, Rick.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** Oh, that was nice.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:06]** You're welcome.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** Yeah, we're friends.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:11]** I'll be sure to help you out with burdens.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** That is kind.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:13]** Yes.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:16]** Let us get to the bottom of this, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** Well, so here's the thing.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:23]** You finally go to investigate the final prize that you've been talking about for a long time.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:31]** This silvery box, presumably Professor Broden Benjamin's relic.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:34]** And as you do, you notice a small flash in your pocket.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:46]** The small blue gem given to you by your old pal Rolo appears to be lighting up the mirror that he gets to this box.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:53]** Here's breath just catches at that.

**[00:25:54 - 00:26:03]** And he just kind of intently looks at the box, kind of leans his head over looking at the glow and pulls out the object and looks at it.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:10]** And he looks at Nick and is like, Hey fly boy, help me open this.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** And he's going to try to hack it.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:18]** Cause I think it's guarded with some electrical lock still.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:18]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:21]** There is a biometric scanner on the front.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:24]** Let me pull you guys over here on the mippity mapsies.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** I'm going to put you here.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** I believe this is a dumb app.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:31]** I would advise against that.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** Nico is low on health.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:38]** If he were to trigger some kind of trap, he may lose his life.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:42]** We know for a fact that this belongs to the professor.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:45]** Let's just bring it back to the professor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** No, no, no, no, no, no.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:46]** All right.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** Let's get the slug.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** Hey, Dr. OK, help me with this.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** You're pretty good with this stuff, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:54]** Nico's going to look over at Rick 19.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:59]** He's going to say, I respect your concern for my well-being.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:01]** I've been shot at all day for this.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** I'd like to see what's inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** This is like, here's needs this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** Nico wants to come over and help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:10]** And Lozu, what is Lozu doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:13]** Lozu is walking over.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** Yeah, she is standing near the space pirate.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:23]** And she is also going through, looking through to see if Algiata had anything.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** And actually, right as that happens...

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** Dr. O'Keefe, you see Lozu.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:40]** She pulls out... She reaches into not-Algiata's pocket and pulls out some sort of comm unit, but it just looks a little different.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** It doesn't look like your comm unit.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:46]** And she kind of is turning it over in her hand and doesn't think anything of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:51]** I'm going to signal, give Rick sort of a nod.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:51]** Okay.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:53]** Is Rick looking at you across the room?

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** Because we have...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:54 - 00:28:00]** I mean, I was, Rick was about to walk away after you guys start fighting over the relic and he gave his two words and he's not going to argue with these guys.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:02]** So he'll walk over to Dr. Okay.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:06]** And say, what, what do you, what is your concern?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** Excuse me.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** May I see that?

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:09]** I'm going to approach.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:10]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** And grab.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** Can I roll perception on that?

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:16]** Yes, you can roll a perception.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** 19, nine, nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:43]** uh it looks to be no in most languages it does mean no in most starfinder languages i just uh okay go ahead so i rolled though it it appears to be a mostly normal she say though she was saying something she was just saying oh sure like she was handing it to you like she she doesn't think anything of it it looks like a different color right it's it's more like a fuchsia it's just different did you get this

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:46]** I just found this on Algiata.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** Did you see me just pull over?

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** Right, right, right.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:54]** And then she said, here, because you asked to look at it.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** She handed it to you.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:58]** And yeah, it looks like a normal comm unit, except it's fuchsia.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** It's like weirdly brightly colored.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** And yeah, that's about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** It is probably a comm unit for the Starfinders.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** We should turn it on and listen in to see if there's anything.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:09]** Starfishers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** Starfishers.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:11]** Yeah.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:17]** So I rolled a 20 on my computer's check to access the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** Okay.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:21]** So you bring out the comm unit.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:35]** It's oddly blank, except there is a program in there that's called Sistership, and it essentially...

**[00:29:35 - 00:30:03]** allows you apparently like you're kind of looking at it just just on the face of it you you haven't gone in further if you want to go in further to it you're gonna need to roll another check but on the face of it it looks like it allows you to connect with another vessel through the drift that sounds like it might be useful so in this and this other vessel has to have this this sister ship program on it in order to connect okay um i'll roll to access it okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:11]** While they're doing that, John, should, uh, here's an, I'd be rolling a computer sec for opening something.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** Not yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** I want to get to that in just a minute.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** 24, 24.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** Yeah.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:23]** You just were able to kind of go through, you open up kind of the backend and you start looking.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:30]** And once you, in our terms, it would be like looking through the notes and you all know more about it.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:34]** But once you look through, see what it's actually doing,

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:40]** It actually just appears to be a typical planetary range comm unit.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:49]** It doesn't actually... The program can't actually access another ship through the drift and communicate with it.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** And the program is almost like a fake.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** It's not real.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:57]** Maybe Rick and Dr. O'Keefe, give me either engineering, physical science, or piloting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** I got a...

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:03]** 27 on my engineering.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:04]** Nice.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Rick?

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** I mean, I... You don't have any of those?

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:07]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:09]** I'm piloting with a minus one.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** Okay, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** Rick just has murder skills.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** That's all he has.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:15]** Whoa, whoa.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:15]** I'm sorry.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** I actually miscounted.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:20]** Murder by... Rick, where'd you roll?

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** I rolled a one for that.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** Oh, okay.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** Yeah, I got absolutely nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:31]** So Rick is looking over your shoulder, Dr. K, being, like, trying to make sense of it and, like, has just reading the things that you can read and is like, wow, that's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:31]** Petting the community.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** That's pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** Petting the community.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:41]** Dr. K, as soon as you realize that this program that can communicate with another ship via the drift cannot do that.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:46]** It's a complicated, very worked over fake program.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:52]** You realize that anything that could communicate to another ship in that way.

**[00:31:52 - 00:32:00]** like in the method that it describes, would have to be a marvel of astrogation engineering and miniaturization.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:06]** Like such technology definitely doesn't exist in any common place that you would know of.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:14]** It would be very bespoke and would probably require massive computers on board of a ship with a lot of power dedicated to it.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:16]** Certainly not possible in this little comm unit.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:18]** What then is its purpose?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:22]** Can I... Yeah...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:49]** nico here's you all are walking over to this box yeah okay so as you do here's of course your blue pocket starting to really light up there is a small blue scanner on it that looks to be a biometric scanner you could probably spoof it and crack open the box if you want to make a computer check either you or nico


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:57]** So Nico's going to suggest to here, it's just like, you want to try and see if it will open for your fingerprint?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** He only has three fingers.

**[00:32:59 - 00:32:59]** Two, technically.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:00]** Thumbs don't count.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:04]** Well, that means just less tries, which is good, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** My wife and I were having this argument.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt, but my wife and I were having an argument.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** No, it wasn't really an argument.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:13]** But do thumbs count as fingers?

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:13]** Yeah.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:18]** Because everything else is an index finger, ring finger, pointer finger, pinky finger.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:18]** It's a digit.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:21]** It's a digit, yes, but not a finger.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:25]** Just as long as we're all in agreement on that, then we can move on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** Important poll that we'll post after this episode releases.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:32]** I feel like a finger also isn't necessarily opposable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** It's true.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** It's a good point.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** It's a good point.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** So there are opposable thumbs.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** Are there not opposable thumbs out there in the world?

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:38]** Yes.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** I can do this with my thumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:41 - 00:34:09]** yeah i don't know like a lot of like like dogs they have like a dick dewclaw or whatever i think cats like that some more yeah so i'm definitely unopposed okay you are definitely unopposable i love it all right so nico yeah i think i think he gets that was yeah that was really good i'm gonna get that punishment yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** How many punishments do you have, Dr. Okay?

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** You can only get one, right?

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:14]** I think you've got one now.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** Here's Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** What are you going to do?

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Back to your conversation.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:23]** Here's this like, I didn't think about that, but why not?

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:31]** And then he puts his, I'm trying to remember what shearing hands look like, but the rightmost digit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:33]** They're like turtle hands kind of, but buggy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** The rightmost digit.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** That's actually really great.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** Onto the little blue screen.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:39]** There is sort of a thumb, so then he'll put that on there.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:39]** Okay.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** And see if it opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:41]** Okay.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** You put it on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:43]** Burn it.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** Doesn't open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:49]** Here's Tri's other, all of his digits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** Nico's going to be like, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:53]** No, that's what yours does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** You press all of your digits each time.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** Burn it.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:55]** Burn it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:56]** All right, cool.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:57]** Let's hack this.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** It doesn't open.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** So, here's Rolls Computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:04]** Nico, you can say something.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:05]** I'll assist.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** Okay.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** It's a 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** 27.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** I succeed.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** Nick.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:14]** I succeed on the assist.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** You do.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:15]** Okay, nice.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** So 29.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** Impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:19]** Hell yeah.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:20]** Thanks, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:31]** As you are going through and spoofing it, it becomes clear pretty quickly, because you did so well on your computer scroll, there was no actual biometric data entered into the lock.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:32]** What?

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:35]** It's kind of in a factory default state.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** All this fake technology.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** And... This is a ruse.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:44]** As it opens, there's a small psss as the top and the front kind of part like this.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:47]** You were meant... As the top goes psss, and it slides down.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:53]** And you see a thin, reflective piece of metal.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:57]** Like a little flat piece, maybe like this, right?

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** Kind of like that.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** Like a small rectangle.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** sitting on a small holder in the box face up.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:11]** And on the side that's facing you appears to be a language that I don't believe any of you recognize.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:18]** I'm going to share it in roll 20 right now so you can say more of what it looks like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** I might.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** Is it Akatonian?

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** Because I know that.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:24]** I am a scholar of the rule.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** Relic note.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:30]** And you can kind of look and see because some of the back is there.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:34]** So when you walk around it, you can see that there's this other font on the other side.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:41]** There's like a symbol that looks like two hooks that are flipped about a center line with another line going through the handle.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:44]** And so you don't have to pick it up to see that.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** You can just kind of...

**[00:36:45 - 00:37:07]** walk around and look down and some of the light comes in you can see that there's a symbol on the other side got you and the other side looks like it has runes like yeah runes and possibly some sort of writing um if if one of you wanted to give me a check for that uh maybe a culture check you could try and at least determine okay i can do that

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** Yeah, Nuko, you might have seen a lot of this.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:12]** Hears might have seen some of this before, but I don't know that you would know.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** You might know what it is.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** What's your check?

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** It's going to be 22.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** A 22.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:28]** You recognize it as a language common, but rarely ever seen it in any structured sense like this.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** It's written in Aklo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:30]** Aklo.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** Aklo.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** Aklo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** Maybe one of you wants to give me a physical science check, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** Sure, I'll do that.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** I'll assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Dr. K, are you walking over?

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:45]** Okay.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:51]** Walking back to see... I rolled a 19 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:58]** Plus... 19 is enough to know that this metal... No, but I have a plus.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Whatever.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:00]** That's fine.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:06]** I'll tell you that this metal, just from the look of it, it looks like nothing you've seen.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:14]** Probably requires some sort of advanced technology to create it, write on it, etch into it.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:24]** For as smooth and polished and shiny as it is, you can tell maybe from some of the grain structure of what's going on and the way that it kind of looks, it doesn't look like anything you've seen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** Hughes is going to roll mysticism on this.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:28]** Okay.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:29]** And it's a 20.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** Okay.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:33]** I'm going to try to determine the nature of the object.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** Yeah.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:39]** So the aklo on the front, that must be some sort of message.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:42]** It seems like a structured language.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:48]** The symbol on the back, however, must mean something.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:58]** It doesn't, the way that it was etched, the way that the symmetry that is put into it, it seems like it could have some sort of significance, what that is.

**[00:38:59 - 00:38:59]** You are not sure yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:03]** It probably says Brodent Benjam.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:06]** Well, it's because it's his box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** It's not his anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:10]** It's not his anymore.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:13]** You can use a culture check to decipher writing, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:15]** Can you?

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:17]** If only I had culture.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:17]** I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:22]** I thought that you needed to know the language in order to actually know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:32]** In an unfamiliar language or message written in an incomplete or archaic form, it takes at least one minute to decipher 250 words of writing or fewer of the jam option.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:35]** Will's culture checks to decipher writing in secret.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:39]** If you succeed, check you understand the general content of the text.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:42]** If you fail, you understand the text.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:48]** If you fail, checked by 10 or more, you entirely misconstrue the meaning of the text.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:58]** You can't take 20 on a culture check to decipher a writing unless you are trained in computer skill and have access to an information network or downloaded dataset.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:03]** In this case, there is no chance of misconcerning the information presented in the writing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** I have my data pad.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:05]** I can take a look at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** Thank you, Will Garrett.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** The rules, paralegal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:12]** Yes, the rules, paralegal for this episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Thank you, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:19]** So do I roll a culture check for that or computers now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:22]** Well, so if I just heard you right, we'll... A culture check.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** A culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** So it's a simple message, right?

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:26]** Yeah.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Depending on the complexity.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** Okay.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:32]** If it's intricate, exotic, or very old writing, it would be like a TC30.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** Standard text, 25.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** Simple message, 20.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:40]** However, I think also I can aid, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** Yeah, I don't see why you couldn't aid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:50]** Also, I can use my automatic success for...

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** I believe it's called Polymath.

**[00:40:53 - 00:41:00]** Once per day, I can automatically succeed and attempt to aid another on an intelligence-based skill chain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:01]** Hell yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:02]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:03]** Is that a feat?

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:07]** Or where does that come from?

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:15]** Osharu spend our lives acquiring vast amounts of knowledge and therefore tend to have

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:20]** Applicable information in most situations, once per day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:22]** They're very soft and intelligent.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:26]** I'm going to need all the help I can get with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:32]** Automatically succeed in an attempt to aid another in an intelligence-based skill check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:36]** I got a natural 14, but I got a plus 9, so that's going to give me 23.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:39]** 23 plus 2 is 25, right?

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Who else is helping?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** Well, Rick and I are uncultured.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** We don't have that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:46]** Yeah, I don't think that you would have that.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:49]** You guys are just uncouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:50]** Okay.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** I mean, a 25 is very good.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:56]** So it's around this time that Lozu starts to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:57]** Come over and assist?

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:58]** Huh?

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** What does she roll?

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** She comes over to assist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** No, she actually just walks over.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:06]** She was just walking over to Billy to see what Billy was doing.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** That 25 is pretty good.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** You feel pretty confident about it.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:12]** And it's at that time that you hear like a...

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:19]** The sound that you recognize as a notification.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** It's coming from somewhere in the cargo bay.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:24]** And it's coming from where Lozu is.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:27]** And then Lozu kind of walks over.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** She's looking at her wrist.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** And she kind of looks at all of you.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:33]** She's a little surprised but prepared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** And then she kind of, what is it, Lozu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** What if Lozu's in on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** I don't know.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** I don't think so.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:41]** We killed all three of the Astrazoans, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:42]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:46]** Can I roll a perception to look over Lozu's shoulder or listen in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** Yeah, well, here.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:53]** So she slowly flips her wrist over and a smile kind of creeps across her face.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:57]** She presses a button and you hear a familiar voice of,

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** Hello?

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:00]** Are you all right?

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** I tried calling.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:06]** And then she kind of looks over to you and seems relieved.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** She's like, yes, yes, I'm fine.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** Yes, this is Keeve.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:10]** I'm happy to hear your voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** Rick will walk over to Lozu and stand next to her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** Rick, you are standing next to Lozu.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** is standing next to Lozu.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:18]** Hears and Nico.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:19]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:22]** was helping with the deciphering and then I guess walked away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:29]** But Nico and Hears are... I thought Lozu was... The noise of the notification distracted me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:32]** Okay, that's fine.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** You point out a couple things to Nico, and then you walk away.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:42]** And she keeps talking, and she's like, I'm happy to hear your voice.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:47]** I was in danger, but thanks to some luck and our fellow passengers, she kind of looks at you, Rick, and smiles.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:49]** Look, I'm all right.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:56]** Nico, as you're putting it together, you're standing next to here as... Mm-hmm.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** I don't like where this is going at all.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** The rough translation.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:05]** Given that Aklo is a common language in Starfinder, Nico, you're looking at it.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:10]** It roughly reads, Relic has been removed.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Install...

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** again soon.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:16]** Rough translation.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:17]** Can you say that again?

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** Relic has been removed.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:22]** Please install again soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:24]** Or will install again soon.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:27]** Install again soon.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** Something like that.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:31]** It doesn't say please or is there any verb?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** It's a rough translation.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** None of you speak Aklo.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:37]** So based on what you could do, that was the rough translation.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** It doesn't quite make sense.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:40]** Is it capitalized or lowercase?

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** I'm not going to answer that.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Is there a proper offensive?

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Lozu.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** What about an exclamation point?

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:45]** Lozu.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:54]** is talking, and Rick, she kind of turns away a little bit, then turns back, and she says, look, just stay where you are.

**[00:44:54 - 00:45:07]** I will come to wherever you... And her voice gets cut off as any words that she had or she was saying are drowned out.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:11]** by a massive explosion that rocks the chimera.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:14]** More violent than any of you have felt before.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** All of you roll a reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** That bad, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Yeah, it's a bad.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** What'd you all get?

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:23]** Oh, I get plus six.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** 14.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:26]** 14 from Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** Nico.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** 19 from Rick.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:29]** 19 from Nick.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Or from Rick.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:32]** Right, right.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** Nico, what'd you get?

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:34]** I got a 14.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** 14.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:38]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:38]** 15.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** All right.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:43]** Maybe here's a Nico because of where you were standing in the crate.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** The crate also moves.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:50]** Both of you fall to the ground prone, dropping this thin piece of metal.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:55]** Rick, Dr. OK, both of you are able to just barely stabilize yourself.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** Maybe you reach out.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:59]** Lozu reaches out and puts her hand against the crate.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:06]** The human space pirate that is bound falls over and is like trying to right.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:21]** herself at that moment lozu kind of looks at you and says are are are you all right can you can you see anything are are are you hurt to the bridge and the words i concur choke in her mouth

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:42]** As her eyes looking at you roll back in her head and you see her face go blank as all the muscles in her body quickly lift up, jerk once violently as a silent scream leaves her open mouth and she falls to the ground motionless.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:50]** Looking over, you see the other pirate who was trying to get up, motionless, lying face down on the cargo bay floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:53]** Doctor, okay, help her.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:59]** And Rick is going to turn to the pirate and do a, I don't have medicine check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:04]** As you walk over, you hear the sound of an even larger explosion.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:05]** Okay.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:17]** that rocks the ship violently, and from the sounds of it, the ship has suffered severe damage, so much so that it seems like it is not far from some sort of potential end of the ship.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:20]** We must get to some sort of escape pod, I believe.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** Okay, this is bad.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:25]** The computer's voice comes over and says, Hull breach detected.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:26]** Abandon ship.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** Repeat, abandon ship.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:33]** Please proceed to the escape pods in a calm and orderly fashion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:35]** Where did we see the escape?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:37]** Probably that locked door in the hallway.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** Okay.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:42]** Can we roll some kind of wisdom check to see if we know where the escape pods would be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** Yes.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:46]** Nico wants to pocket that thing immediately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** Okay, so here's you pocket it.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:50]** Rick, is there anything else in that box?

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** There's nothing else in the box.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** There's just the thin metal thing.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:56]** Nico, what were you saying?

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:56]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:59]** Nico is going to be like,

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:06]** Well, it sounds like this ship doesn't... He's looking over at here as he's saying, well, it sounds like this ship doesn't have long hair.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:13]** I never fancied myself as a pirate, but... Yeah, let's... Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** Oh, yeah, totally.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** Ready?

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** Yes, totally.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:24]** I never fancied myself as a pirate, but I think it's time for some piracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** Let's take their ship.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** What are you guys going on about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** If it's not entirely compromised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** So what do you guys want to do?

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:48]** In the cargo bay that you are in, some panels have fallen, and there is some steam or something from some pipes that have burst, and the room is starting to slowly get all smoky because it seems like the ship is starting to come apart at the seams from this explosion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:50]** Nick wants to roll a medicine check on either Lozu.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:55]** Well, I'm assuming Dr. Oki's going to do Lozu, and I'm going to do it on the pirate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:59]** I will roll for Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** I got a 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:04]** Yeah, it seems like the pirate fell down.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:07]** There's no physical violence that's going on with their body.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:10]** It just seems like they fell over.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:15]** But I will say that it does seem like you all need to leave soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** Is she alive or dead?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** The pirate is dead.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Lozu is dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:22]** Let's get out of here.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** What?

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** Take her comm wrist thing.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:29]** We take her comm and the access code thing for the chimera.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:30]** We take it off of her.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:34]** She discussed earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** How is Lozu dead?

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:38]** How are Lozu and that pirate dead?

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** Yeah, how are they dead if we survived?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:42]** We don't know, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:44]** They just dropped dead.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:49]** She was literally standing in front of them, jerks up violently, surprised, falls dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:50]** Oh, man.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** I feel bad.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:54]** I kind of like those of you.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:54]** Me too.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:56]** Here's to Nick.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** I really like where you're going with this.

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:01]** I love the spirit kid, but I think the ship is kind of over.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:02]** Let's cover our ass.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** Lesson one in being a pirate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** That's kind of why we got to steal their shit.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:08]** Oh, I got you.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** Okay, so what do you guys want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:12]** I rolled a 15 on wisdom.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** Okay, you rolled a 15 on wisdom.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:30]** You do recall that at the end of the living quarters, right when you walked in, you could see at the other end, and I think one time you went up those ladders, there are escape pods at the end of the hallway past the living quarters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:33]** So Rick will look at the others and say, I know where the escape pods are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** Let's get out of here.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:35]** Okay.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:43]** I'm going to follow, but the whole time I'm going to be trying to communicate with Keeve on the wrist thing from Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:50]** Okay, so you quickly grab Lozu's communicator, and Nico and Hears, you all are following as well.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Yeah.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:55]** Nico's going to be calling out to Rick and to Dr. Okay.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** He's going to be like, what's your plan?

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:58]** We can't just hop into an escape pod.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:00]** Whatever's destroying the ship will destroy us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** We're not going to die.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:03]** That's what the plan is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:07]** Can I do a wisdom check to know where the pirate ship is going to be docked?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:10]** Yeah, that's what I want to try and ask Keef to figure out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:16]** So, Dr. Okay, so as you're walking up to the door, Dr. Okay, you're like, what do you say to Keeve?

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:18]** Keeve, are you there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:21]** Answer me.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** No response.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** No response.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** Back on the communicator.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** No response.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:27]** No response.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:34]** Rick, I think in a... Is there any sensors on the ship that I can see from Lozu's console or wrist pad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** There are no sensors that you could see.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:48]** There was the sense that the explosions that you heard when you were in the secret room with Trostenec seemed like they were coming from the airlock that you entered in.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:53]** It seemed like that was the one that was where those breaching explosions came through.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** So it could be the case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:58]** Is it safe to have blown the airlock on their way out is what you're trying to get at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:04]** I'm saying when they came in, it's likely that they probably came in from one of the side airlocks, the same one that you entered in.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:08]** However, here's, give me a culture check for pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** I don't have culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** That's fine.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:12]** I'll say that as a pirate then.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** You should have a profession.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:16]** I have a profession, but that's pirate though, so can I draw a pirate check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** Yeah, do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** What is it, just a d20 then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** Yeah, d20.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Do you have professional pirate?

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:24]** You should get like a plus two because you're a professional pirate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:28]** I'll just do... Under your skills, it should say profession and then in parentheses pirate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:33]** But I can assist this culture because I did roll a... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:36]** I feel like, yes, you guys are realizing that you need to leave.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** You're walking up to the door.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** The door hasn't opened yet.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:42]** And when Nico was like, guys, we need a plan, you all stop and you're like, shoot, you're right.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** We do need a plan.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** And now you're like talking it out.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:47]** I rolled an 18 on piracy, I suppose.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** 18 on piracy.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:56]** You think that it is possible that there have been some pirates who have been known to board a ship on one airlock and then go to another airlock.

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:02]** So it could be the case that they are trying to go to a different airlock.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:06]** So the ship could be at another airlock or it could be at the one that they started.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:10]** You don't just think of that one place.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:12]** You're like, oh, it could also be any other airlock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:18]** And there's no indication that the airlock in this cargo hold is open or... I think that you guys went in there, right?

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:22]** Yeah, well, I tried to, and you were like, no, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:23]** Oh, okay.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** I didn't mean to.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:26]** If you want to go in there and try and do that, that's fine.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:29]** But it doesn't seem like... I would have gone in there to check it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** So you said there was nothing wrong with that airlock?

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:31]** There was nothing wrong with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** It doesn't seem like there was nothing.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:38]** We have our standard second skin EVA, right?

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:38]** Yeah.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:38]** You do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** But that won't help us in case the ship implodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:44]** And from everything that's going on around you, it seems like it might.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** What do you guys want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** I mean... We're heading out the door.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:50]** We're running down the halls.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:50]** Okay.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** You head out the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Let's go find the ship then.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** Okay.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** Possibly going for the ship.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** Possibly going for the escape pods.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** Going to see what happens.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** You walk out the door.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** I'm going to reveal this.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:01]** Sorry, I had to do the polygon reveal.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** But I'm trying to keep things moving.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:06]** And as you walk out the ship...

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** Or walk out the door, not the ship.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:13]** You walk out the door and there's debris and there's chaos everywhere.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:15]** There's another explosion that you feel.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** You all kind of steady yourselves.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:20]** And whatever just hit the ship again did a number, real number to it.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** There are wiring.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** There's pipes hanging off the ceiling.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:25]** The floor panels are uneven.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:30]** The emergency lights are flickering on and off at best.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:38]** And as you guys start to move south down the corridor in front of the cargo bay, I'm just going to tell you this right now.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:44]** In order to get wherever you want to get, there's going to be some level of success and checks that need to happen.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:46]** Ooh, fun.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:46]** Oh!

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:49]** So I'm just letting you guys know, be careful.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:53]** Think and your decisions will have impacts for how well you do on things.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** So just keep this.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** Okay.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** So what's your order going down?

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** Let me lead the way.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** And Rick kind of pushes to the front.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** Risk going first, followed by?

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** Nico goes second.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:03]** Nico's going second.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:03]** Okay.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** Here's Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:07]** I'll take the rear.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:07]** Okay.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** I'll go third.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:31]** okay i totally can like picture you guys come in there's like stuff hanging down uh it's high pressure and rick is like i'm going and nico's like you know what me too let's do this so you guys go sinking sorry the ship's ship's sinking what are you all thinking god so rick is in like survival mode i'm yes survival for my life


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:34]** Nico's just thinking to himself, is this day ever going to end?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:38]** Yeah, he fought six battles, and then now the ship is going haywire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:39]** Here's, what are you thinking?

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:43]** Here's thinking that it would be ideal to find that ship.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:45]** That would put us in the best position going forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** We also need to check on the professor.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** There's no time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:52]** They need to have a slug for themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Speak for yourself, Dr. OK.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** I would save your slug hide, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:59]** I just meant for the professor.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** Because who all was still alive?

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** Lozu, the pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:04]** Lozu's dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:05]** Well, I know.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:08]** I said was, like, beginning of the episode.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:13]** So Lozu, the pirates, Keeve, Professor Benjamin.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** And Grath.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** And Grath.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:15]** Presumably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:17]** You haven't confirmed on Grath, but presumably.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** You haven't heard anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** I'm sure Grath is dead.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:22]** Because he was last seen with the captain who was not the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** Let's see what happens.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:35]** As you turn the corner, just as you get to that bend in the hallway, that 45-degree bend, there's, like, a crack and a ping as the pipes in front of you actually burst.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:48]** And this, like, huge layer of caustic gas pops out in front of you and totally starts to fill the corridor, but is especially right there as it just...

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:53]** coming out, coming out, coming out in front of you as a hazard.

**[00:56:54 - 00:57:00]** So if you want to get through, you all will need to make a reflex save to get through the corridor.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:04]** Uh, is this a disease?

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:09]** Uh, no, it just seems like a bunch of caustic chemicals that are coming out of the pipe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:19]** Okay, because, um, I'm constructed, so that means that, um, I get a plus two to saves versus disease, mind effects, poison, and sleep.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** Just to remind you of that.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:21]** Okay.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:21]** Okay.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:23]** And also I have a very high survivability.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:49]** i am just highly survival i'm going to give myself a uh minor booster okay minor booster what does it do uh i will gain a plus four bonus on the next saving throw against uh drug or poison against drug or poison okay within the next hour okay nice plus what's the saving throw sorry

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:52]** plus four bonus on the next saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** On the next saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:54 - 00:58:04]** One of the things for survival is orienteering, which says once each hour while traveling through unfamiliar terrain and each time you move close to a natural hazard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:06]** So I'm going to actually just go through.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** Okay, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:08]** Cool.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:16]** Such as quicksand or patches of poisonous atmosphere, you can use survival to keep from getting lost or notice or avoid the hazard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:18]** I don't think that would necessarily apply here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** O.K., give me your... It says to avoid the hazard of poisons.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** You just said poison.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:25]** I just don't want to wait for... No, it's just caustic acid and chemicals.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:32]** I didn't say it was... It is not explicitly a poison, and also survival in general, I don't think this would necessarily apply.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:35]** You need to make a reflex save to get through if you want to get through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:37]** Well, I rolled a good reflex save.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:37]** Okay.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** Will, what did you roll?

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** I rolled reflex.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:40]** Dr.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:40]** O.K.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:40]** ?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:44]** That is a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:46]** A 17 from Dr. OK.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** Dr. OK charges through.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** Rick?

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:48]** 22.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:52]** 22 as Rick charges through.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:52]** 21.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** Here's Nico.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** You all going through?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:58]** 12 on the die plus 6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** That's 18 for me.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:01]** 12 on the die plus 6.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** That's 18.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Impressive.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:03]** Here's what we're saying.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:04]** 12.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:04]** 12.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** 12.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:07]** Hopefully that's enough.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:09]** All right, so all of you run through.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** Come out the other side.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:12]** Sputtering.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:17]** You're feeling something on your armor, though, and maybe on your face.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** The three of you, Dr. O.K.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:27]** and Nico and Rick, you all take four damage as some of the chemicals just got in between some of your armor and everything.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:32]** And here's you take eight damage because it just, yeah.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:34]** You said four points of damage?

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** Four points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:36]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:36]** Okay.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:39]** Yeah, this is no joke.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:42]** Getting off the ship is going to be a challenge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:45]** And as soon as we're across here, we're right next to the gym, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:47]** Yeah, so you cross through.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:52]** The gas seems to kind of disperse right after the chemicals hit the air.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:54]** So it's not really filling it too much.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:58]** It was really just getting through those liquid gases.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** That was not good.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:06]** Now you are next to the gym, and let me reveal the rest of the hallway for you.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** Just full of pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:11]** Nico's going to be calling out, does anybody have any type of med stim?

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:12]** I'm not doing so hot here.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:12]** Oh, wow.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:13]** Oh, dang.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** Okay.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:14]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Nico's not doing great.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** Does anybody have anything?

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:20]** I feel like you guys have a Mark I healing serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:20]** Yes.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:22]** I have two.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:23]** You have two?

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:24]** Okay.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:26]** I can administer one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:29]** Please, I'm not doing so hot here.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:30]** Do I have to roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:32]** I don't have to roll, do I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:34]** I think so, for a Mark I healing serum.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** Mark I healing serum.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** What's the roll?

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** It's a D8.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** D8, okay.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** Yep, D8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:43]** Roll high.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** Nico of six points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:48]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** Six points, nice.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:53]** That is a good roll from the Mark I healing serum.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:56]** Takes to Nico's blood well.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:56]** What are you all thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** Hey, doctor.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** Doctor, could you top me off, too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:02]** Do you need to be topped off?

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:04]** Because Nico is on the verge of death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:07]** I mean, I'm not far from there myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:09]** Nico, how many hit points, stamina points do you have?

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** What's the breakdown?

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:13]** I have zero stamina points.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:17]** That caustic hit right there took me down to two health points.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** Oh, man.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:19]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** So you're at eight HP?

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:21]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:25]** What's your resolve points at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:50]** one you have one shit so he would he would die if yeah if nico takes any more damage he would have technically six seconds yeah so what happens is uh when you go down you have one turn in order to be stabilized or have something done to you to help out and uh and then afterwards is when you start spending resolve points so and nico has no resolve points right you

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:52]** No, I have one resolve point.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:53]** You have one.

**[01:01:53 - 01:02:01]** So in combat, technically, I would say, since we're not necessarily in combat, I would say that you would have one chance.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:05]** Depending on what happened afterwards, that one resolve point might save you.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:09]** We'd have to go into some technical stuff to figure that out.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:11]** But I'm saying you might want to save that healing serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:13]** You'd still be unconscious and we'd have to drag you.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** You could stabilize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:21]** I'd say because of that resolve point, then probably Dr. OK would likely have a chance, one chance to stabilize.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:24]** That's probably how that would work because of that resolve point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:26]** You just said you have cure light wounds.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:28]** You can treat deadly wounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:53]** i have treat deadly wounds but that takes like 20 minutes or something like yeah we don't have that time yeah so uh you would just need a med kit or you know um yeah here you can receive this treatment only once every 24 okay right i'll read it okay it only takes this takes one minute actually yeah the problem is that one minute's a long time one minute's a long time the result point yeah uh here's also the thing give me some perception check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]** I mean, I'm not that bad.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:59]** I'm like, I have 11 out of 16 hit points.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:01]** I keep taking huge amounts of damage.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:02]** That's why I get worried.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:02]** Okay.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:06]** Let's just get out of here.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:07]** Did you just do a perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:08]** I did, yeah.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:10]** Roll a perception check as you come through the caustic chemicals.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:12]** 13.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:12]** 13.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:12]** 25.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:18]** 25.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:18]** Nicely done.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:19]** Here's Nico.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:21]** That's a 12 for me.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:22]** 12?

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:22]** Okay, here's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:23]** Which roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:25]** Perception.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:25]** Perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Perception.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:26]** All right.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:27]** Sorry.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** It's 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:30]** 20.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:30]** Nice.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:31]** Okay.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:37]** Here's... And Dr. Okay, both of you notice a head, maybe a little bit... A head?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** Just a head floating there?

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:41]** You see a floating head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:44]** This is where it gets weird, as if it didn't get weird before.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:48]** Right in front of you, there seems to be a small panel...

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:51]** That swings open as an explosion hit.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:53]** It kind of creaks open.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:58]** And when it does, you see inside that there's like an emergency kit.

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:59]** There's like a little case.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:01]** And inside you see a basic med kit.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:03]** You see a crowbar.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:08]** You see a basic hand axe and a fire extinguisher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** grabbing all that shit.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:15]** Yeah, someone's got to carry that one here.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** I'll take the med kit.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:20]** We have an axe and a what?

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:22]** A crowbar and a fire extinguisher.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:25]** Honestly, all of that could come in handy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:27]** Give me the fire extinguisher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:29]** I was going to say, I'll take the fire extinguisher.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:33]** Who's got high strength should take the axe and crowbar, perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** That should be Rick, probably.

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:37]** My strength is a plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:40]** What's your total strength?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:42]** My total strength is 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:45]** I have a plus zero on my strength.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:46]** I'm high dex.

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:49]** Guys, I'm like disappearing into my background.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:49]** It's like just my head.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:52]** There's the head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:55]** I thought you were like a soldier.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:57]** I thought soldiers had strength.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:57]** Or Dex.

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:59]** I'm a Dex base.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:00]** Or Dex.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** Not all soldiers have strength, okay, guys?

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:03]** Yeah, we're not all Dex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:04]** All right, so what are you guys doing?

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:06]** You have the gym to your right.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** You have the hallway in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:12]** So Rick remembers that the pirates were trapped in there.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:13]** Yes.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:18]** So he wants to, can I just do a perception check through the window and see if they're still alive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** Yes, that is fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** Natural 20 on that, so 25.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:25]** Yeah, 25.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:28]** You look through, and I will reveal it.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:34]** You see all of them lying face down, not moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:35]** We don't know if they're alive or dead?

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** They're probably dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:37]** They're motionless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:38]** They're just lying there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:40]** Probably dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:43]** GTFO.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:46]** I agree with the doc.

**[01:05:46 - 01:06:00]** The improvised barricades that the starfishers have put up in the hallway with the explosions have totally kind of crumbled, so there's no penalty for moving through those areas as you look down the 60 feet towards the bend in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:07]** Let's find the ship that we can take, or let's get it to escape.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** The first...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:09]** Yeah, first one we find.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:11]** So you guys start moving down the hallway.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:13]** What are you looking for?

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:13]** What are you doing?

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:15]** And who is going first?

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:16]** Because you all are moving at the same time.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:18]** So let's keep it in an orderly fashion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:22]** He's kind of keeping an eye out for any kind of dangers and ducking and dodging.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:23]** Ducking and dodging.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:25]** We can cut through the kitchen if we need to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:32]** Nico's going to try to... He's not going to be last, but he's going to be second to last.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:33]** Second to last.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:33]** Okay.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:40]** Rick, as you come across, you're coming up to the left-hand turn that would lead to the corridor to the front entrance of the cafeteria.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:41]** Two things.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:51]** One, you recall that the door ahead on your right was the door that you came through when you were boarding.

**[01:06:51 - 01:07:00]** The other thing is that as you guys start moving forward, you see the wall in front of you at the very end of the corridor.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:07]** Kind of like lean in, burst forward, and broken panels explode and hit the wall.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:11]** And then pipes start to stretch and come out.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:16]** And the sharp twisted metal as the wall like semi-collapses open.

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:21]** And not open to space, but just open to whatever was inside.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:24]** And so this steam kind of starts to pour out.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:31]** You see that in the corner, there is a small gap that you could maybe squeeze through.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:38]** You could also try to maybe remove some of the heavier debris to make more room, or you could make your way around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:43]** Yeah, Rick kind of slams on the brakes and turns back and says, cut through the kitchen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:45]** Let's cut through the kitchen here.

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:47]** You're going to cut through the kitchen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:50]** So you all go through.

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:53]** I'm just going to reveal a little bit so that way you saw kind of what was going on down there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:56]** Actually, can we go through the... The galley?

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:59]** Yeah, because the galley's got a door right in the center.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:00]** Okay.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:02]** So you all go through the galley.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:04]** I'm going to reveal the galley.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:07]** The galley where you first fought Space Slice.

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:10]** The galley where the... Our first combat.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:11]** Well, your second combat.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:12]** Where you had jokes.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:14]** Our second combat.

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:15]** Lots of things happened in the galley.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:16]** It was a fun time for all.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:18]** What are you all thinking?

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:19]** Lice to know ya.

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:21]** Lice to know ya.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:24]** Rick's like the last one through the door, and he doesn't see anything.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** He doesn't see anything.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:26]** All he sees is the back of Dr.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:26]** O.K.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:26]** 's head.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:29]** Yep.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:31]** You don't see anything.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:31]** Let's go through.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** Okay.

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:33]** So what door?

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:34]** So you walk in the left door.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:38]** There's the door across from you, which is the mirror hallway that you're on, or there's the front door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:43]** Rick's going to go to the center door and do a perception check down that hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** Oh, my God.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:50]** I've rolled, like, four natural ones today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:51]** Okay.

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:51]** All right.

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:52]** I'm rolling perception.

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:57]** It's 18.

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:58]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:58 - 01:08:59]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:59 - 01:09:00]** It's a 19 for me.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:03]** It's a 19 for Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:04]** Okay.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:05]** Kelly, you got an 18.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:05]** 19.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:06]** Kelly got an 18.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:08]** Dr. K, you got what?

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:09]** Sorry.

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:10]** 17.

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:12]** 17.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:14]** And Rick got a 5.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:14]** 5.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:15]** Okay.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:15]** Oh, man.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:17]** This is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:23]** If that hallway is clear, Rick is going to dart down and try to check on the professor and see if he's... This is what I'll tell you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:24]** You'll see.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:24]** Okay.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:26]** So I can picture it.

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:28]** The galley is in complete distress.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:29]** Tables everywhere.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:30]** Stuff's hanging down from the ceiling.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:35]** Any food that was stored or any cleaning supplies that were stored in the walls have just fallen out.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:38]** You're like semi-tripping over stuff.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:40]** It's not enough to make you move any slower.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:43]** But I'll tell you what you see.

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:49]** You open the door, and you see to your right the crumbling wall that proved an impasse before.

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:57]** You see to your left the mirror hallway looks to be fine, except, of course, some debris along the hallway.

**[01:09:58 - 01:10:00]** Down the hallway, you're going to see three things.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:03]** I'm going to reveal them slowly.

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:12]** First, you see the body of Professor Benjam, but...

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:15]** Their mouth seems to be moving.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:16]** You can just barely make it out.

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:21]** It looks a little bit like their head is just moving a little bit and maybe their mouth is moving.

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:23]** You can't tell.

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:27]** You also see about 20 feet beyond Professor Benjam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:31]** My heart is racing for all of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:31 - 01:10:32]** Yes, I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:32 - 01:10:33]** What is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:41]** You see a raging inferno of fire about waist high with some of the flames that are starting to lick up the walls.

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:48]** It's maybe seven feet long, just enough that if you wanted to, you could jump through it.

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:50]** You might be able to jump through it.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:53]** You could jump over or run through.

**[01:10:53 - 01:11:16]** finally you see one last thing and that is the end of the corridor where there are ladders and you can just barely make this out but at the end you do see a faint blue light and you see what you think might be you think those might be the lights to the escape pods


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:18]** Okay, question before we do anything else.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:28]** We think that the starfishers came through the escape hatch or the airlock on this side, the opposite side that we came through the galley?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:29]** Yeah.

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:32]** Okay.

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:36]** So Rick will say to, you know, just out loud to somebody.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:39]** Actually, he's going to be deliberate because if you're not deliberate, nobody will do it.

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:40]** Is that right?

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:41]** That's like a psychological thing.

**[01:11:42 - 01:11:47]** So he's going to tell Hears, like, Hears, check to see if the pirate ship is still attached to that airlock.

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:53]** And then he's going to hit open the door and start charging down this hallway towards Dr. or Professor Benjamin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:54]** Okay.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:57]** All right, here's response like, get Benjam, get Benjam.

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:59]** And then goes for it to look for that airline.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:08]** I'm going to stay here and relay a message between us since I don't think we can communicate over a distance greater than this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:12]** And Rick's going to also ask for the fire extinguisher that we just got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:15]** I'm going to toss him the fire extinguisher.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:15]** Nice.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:20]** As I hold the crowbar and toss the axe to Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:21]** Okay, Nico has the axe.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:23]** Dr. Okay has the crowbar.

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:25]** Rick has the fire extinguisher.

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:28]** Here's is going to check out the... I also have the medkit.

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:30]** You also have the medkit.

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:32]** Okay, okay, okay, okay.

**[01:12:32 - 01:12:33]** I have the extra medkit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:37]** So as Nico catches the axe, he's also going to draw out his pistol.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:40]** So he's going to be having an axe in one hand and the pistol in the other.

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:40]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:41]** Okay, you're prepped.

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:43]** I mean, this is crazy.

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:44]** The ship is falling apart.

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:48]** As you can hear, like, minor explosions as you realize systems are starting to go.

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:53]** The ship is getting pretty close to exploding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:56]** Actually, I'm going to switch that.

**[01:12:55 - 01:13:04]** Because I feel like the X would be more appropriate for firefighting at a crowbar for prying open the doors on a pirate ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:08]** So how about we switch that?

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:09]** All right.

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:10]** I mean, I got the crowbar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:10]** Okay.

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:12]** You two are standing here debating as the ship is falling apart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:13]** No, no, no.

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:14]** You should take the crowbar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:15]** I will say this.

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:20]** Just keep in mind, again, this will impact checks, rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:21]** No, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:26]** You guys are splitting up, and two of you are going one way, and two of you are going down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:30]** Nico's going to be saying to everybody, we're running out of time here.

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:31]** Yeah, you guys are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:33]** All right, which one do we want to do first?

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:34]** Maybe here's Nico.

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:36]** You guys want to go over?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:36 - 01:13:41]** Rick was already moving, so he's going to run and slide down to Professor Benjamin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:43]** Okay, runs, slides down to Professor Benjamin.

**[01:13:43 - 01:13:44]** Dr.

**[01:13:44 - 01:13:45]** O.K., are you with Rick or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:50]** I'm standing at the end of the hallway to keep communication between both parties.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:51 - 01:13:51]** Yep, got it.

**[01:13:51 - 01:13:52]** That clicks now.

**[01:13:53 - 01:13:53]** That clicks.

**[01:13:54 - 01:14:03]** Rick, you come up to the professor, and the professor has a thousand-yard stare, but their mouth is like...

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:20]** moving and you can you can't really hear it you're like are they are they actually saying something like is it just too loud because the ship is falling down around me what is going on so you put your ear up to their mouth and you just hear air of like

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:25]** And his eyes just have this thousand-yard stare.

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:32]** But then the voice, right as you get close, the voice seems to pick up almost kind of an afterthought.

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:34]** Like, it's just muscle memory.

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:35]** It's really weird.

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:43]** And the breath goes from, like... And then it goes to...

**[01:14:57 - 01:14:59]** and he dies.

**[01:14:59 - 01:15:01]** And he falls motionless.

**[01:15:02 - 01:15:05]** Nico, of course, didn't hear that, but Nick did.

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:07]** I have no idea what that was.

**[01:15:07 - 01:15:08]** What did he say?

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:09]** I couldn't hear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:15]** He said, My heart will never... You're whispering again.

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:16]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:17]** I did it on purpose.

**[01:15:17 - 01:15:22]** He said, My heart will never ca... and then dies.

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:24]** My heart will never ca...

**[01:15:25 - 01:15:27]** dies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:27 - 01:15:28]** You know what it is.

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:30]** Well, Hears doesn't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:30 - 01:15:30]** Oh my god!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:32]** What?

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:34]** What is going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:39]** Alright, Nico, Hears, this is so terrible shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:41]** Oh no!

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:48]** You are... Alright, Hears is going to telepathically communicate to Rick and be like, check his room, check his room, quick, quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:49 - 01:15:50]** Well, you don't know what's going on.

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:51]** You wouldn't be able to tell me that.

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:54]** You wouldn't know any of that.

**[01:15:54 - 01:15:54]** Oh, shit.

**[01:15:55 - 01:16:01]** So Rick tries, he just frantically starts doing CPR on him, and he fails miserably.

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:03]** Rick, what did he say to you?

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:05]** You're shouting down the hallway.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:11]** He was saying something about his heart is in carbs.


## Speaker_0

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:13]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:15]** You heard it well enough to know what he said.

**[01:16:16 - 01:16:16]** Wow.

**[01:16:16 - 01:16:17]** You heard it well enough to know what he said.

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:19]** That's what I thought you said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:20]** What did you say?

**[01:16:20 - 01:16:22]** So also Nico will tell.

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:23]** Here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:24]** Okay.

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:27]** But keep in mind that they've turned the corner.

**[01:16:27 - 01:16:29]** You guys are like time is going.

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:31]** You guys have turned the corner and you are in front of it.

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:33]** But I was still in communication with them.

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:37]** Yeah, I'm just saying that they're moving around the corner now.

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:40]** So we heard.

**[01:16:40 - 01:16:41]** Yeah, what do you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:48]** As Dr. OK says that, Nico's gonna double... He's gonna do a double take.

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:49]** He said what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:52]** Here's just like turns quickly and just looks at him with his mouth open.

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:58]** And then... Says... Go find the pirate ship.

**[01:16:58 - 01:16:59]** Go find it.

**[01:17:00 - 01:17:00]** It's probably up here.

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:02]** And then like...

**[01:17:04 - 01:17:04]** dashes back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:05 - 01:17:07]** Okay, so here's the dashing back.

**[01:17:07 - 01:17:09]** Nico, you run up to the airlock doors.

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:12]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:13 - 01:17:17]** Let's start with a perception check to see if the pirate ship's on the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:18 - 01:17:18]** Okay.

**[01:17:19 - 01:17:20]** There's no window.

**[01:17:20 - 01:17:22]** You can't see through the airlock.

**[01:17:22 - 01:17:23]** You can't see outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:26]** Is there a computer terminal next to the airlock?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:29]** There is a computer terminal, but there's not a video camera mounted on it.

**[01:17:30 - 01:17:53]** um with the airlock status yeah that's what i was thinking okay some sort of coupling okay yeah you check it uh i'll say you don't need to like try and break in or do any engineering to get that uh you check you don't see anything coupled there because if because if you recall the airlock goes in and then turns immediately to your left and you don't see anything coupled there like there's no status of anything there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:54 - 01:17:59]** So can Nico check the air levels in the airlock?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:59 - 01:18:06]** Yes, but I will say that after that, you really don't have much else that you can do because now you're starting to spend time with the computer and the ship is falling apart.

**[01:18:07 - 01:18:12]** The air levels in the airlock seem like they're stable.

**[01:18:12 - 01:18:14]** There's not really any reading to say that they're not.

**[01:18:15 - 01:18:15]** I'll say this.

**[01:18:15 - 01:18:16]** They seem like they're fine.

**[01:18:16 - 01:18:19]** It seems like the airlock is still intact, if that's what you're wondering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:20 - 01:18:20]** Okay.

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:23]** So Nico wants to open the airlock for a moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:24]** Okay.

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:27]** You press the button and it goes, it doesn't open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:29]** Okay.

**[01:18:29 - 01:18:30]** And Nico's going to call back.

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:32]** It's a dead end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:43]** Rick is going to jump over Professor Benjam and shrug his shoulders at Hears as he sees Hears running.

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:47]** And then he's going to run over and start putting out the fire with the fire extinguisher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:48 - 01:18:53]** Hears is going to check Dr. Benjam's person for any items really quickly.

**[01:18:53 - 01:18:54]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[01:18:55 - 01:18:58]** So that's what perception, so it's a 16?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:59 - 01:19:00]** It's a 16, yeah.

**[01:19:00 - 01:19:04]** I'll say that you would need to roll perception because everything is going on around you.

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:10]** The ship is literally falling apart, as is my computer as it's trying to process a PDF and recording and roll 20.

**[01:19:11 - 01:19:15]** So I'm going to go to the old trusty standby, the book itself.

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:17]** You go through and...

**[01:19:19 - 01:19:45]** here's you do see that on professor that on professor benjam he has a couple things he has a mark one ring of resistance i'll say that you're able to quickly grab that if you would like to grab it yeah okay he has it around his neck he's not wearing it it's on a chain around his neck underneath his armor or like his his suit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:46 - 01:19:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:46 - 01:19:47]** That's it.

**[01:19:47 - 01:19:49]** That's all that he has on him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:49 - 01:19:51]** Does Hears remember which room is his?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:19:52 - 01:19:57]** Yeah, so both Rick and Hears, you do recall that his room is the one on the other side of the fire.

**[01:19:58 - 01:19:58]** Okay.

**[01:19:58 - 01:19:59]** Give me one sec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:19:59 - 01:20:04]** Because this would be the first one was the Hobgoblin and the Goblins.

**[01:20:04 - 01:20:06]** The second one was one of your guys'.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:07 - 01:20:08]** That was Gingerogas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:08 - 01:20:10]** Yeah, Gingerogas on one side and the Goblins on the other?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:11]** Yep, yep, yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:12]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:12 - 01:20:13]** Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:13 - 01:20:17]** And then the next two were, I forget, Hears and Dr. Okay.

**[01:20:17 - 01:20:19]** And then the next two were Nico and Rick.

**[01:20:20 - 01:20:23]** The very next ones were Trust the Neck and Professor Benjo.

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:24]** Professor Benjo.

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:25 - 01:20:25]** I love it.

**[01:20:25 - 01:20:26]** I love it.

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:27]** Let's get to the pods.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:28]** Okay.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:30]** And get through all this garbage.

**[01:20:30 - 01:20:31]** All right.

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:32]** Is this fire out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:33 - 01:20:33]** Did you put it out?

**[01:20:33 - 01:20:35]** So here's the thing.

**[01:20:35 - 01:20:36]** Rick, you run up.

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:38]** You're going to use a fire extinguisher.

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:39]** Yes.

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:39]** Okay.

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:40 - 01:20:45]** Do I need to add a fire extinguisher to my inventory and roll a text?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:45]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:46]** You don't need to.

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:48]** I will say this.

**[01:20:49 - 01:20:53]** Because you all went through and didn't try and take time, I think that was fine.

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:55]** And you went directly across.

**[01:20:56 - 01:20:58]** You kind of just quickly circumvented.

**[01:20:58 - 01:21:07]** But with the way the fire's been running, I'll say probably, unfortunately, I think Nico is going to be the only person who takes this minus two penalty because you were up.

**[01:21:07 - 01:21:12]** And at this time, you guys were starting to use the fire extinguisher.

**[01:21:12 - 01:21:16]** So the fire has grown while this is happening since you're probably the last person who's going to roll, Nico.

**[01:21:17 - 01:21:20]** But since you're using the fire extinguisher, Rick, you start to –

**[01:21:20 - 01:21:23]** spray it, and you realize the fire's never going to go out.

**[01:21:23 - 01:21:32]** Whatever is feeding it is constantly feeding it, but you are able to kind of quickly clear a path, so everyone's going to get a plus four to their reflex save in order to get through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:32 - 01:21:36]** As soon as he kills the fire, he turns back and goes to his room to check his email.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:37 - 01:21:38]** Check his email?

**[01:21:38 - 01:21:39]** Yeah.

**[01:21:39 - 01:21:39]** Okay, yeah.

**[01:21:39 - 01:21:41]** There are some things you should probably clear out.

**[01:21:41 - 01:21:43]** You probably get, like, a little ad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:43 - 01:21:44]** My browser history.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:45 - 01:21:46]** That is a question.

**[01:21:46 - 01:21:49]** Do you all want to get anything from your rooms?

**[01:21:49 - 01:21:50]** Is there anything that you want?

**[01:21:50 - 01:21:50]** No?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:51 - 01:21:54]** So Nico's going to make sure he has everything from his room before he goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:54 - 01:21:57]** Yeah, I didn't leave anything behind, so...

**[01:21:56 - 01:22:01]** We're going Paragus rules here.

**[01:22:01 - 01:22:05]** I was just joking when I said that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:05 - 01:22:08]** No, it's a good thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:08 - 01:22:09]** If you guys want, you guys can do that.

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:10]** Anything you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:22:10 - 01:22:15]** I want to just stop and take a long rest, actually.

**[01:22:15 - 01:22:17]** That's funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:17 - 01:22:21]** Wait, let me grab all my D6s to see exactly how much damage you take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:22 - 01:22:43]** rather all my d12s uh so rick i feel like you are like spraying and you're trying to help to know like when john says all his d12s that's like a bag of 100 d12s i don't have that much but i have a lot yeah anyways what were you saying john uh you're spraying the fire extinguisher awesome call who's gonna jump first or are you jumping first rick

**[01:22:43 - 01:22:44]** I'll go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:44 - 01:22:45]** Rick jumps first.

**[01:22:45 - 01:22:46]** So, Rick.

**[01:22:47 - 01:22:47]** Okay.

**[01:22:47 - 01:22:48]** Rick first.

**[01:22:48 - 01:22:48]** Dr. O.K.

**[01:22:48 - 01:22:48]** second.

**[01:22:49 - 01:22:49]** Here's third.

**[01:22:49 - 01:22:52]** I'm going to say, Nico, you're probably going to be last because you were running down the hall.

**[01:22:53 - 01:22:53]** Okay.

**[01:22:53 - 01:22:56]** Were you going to check the doctor's room too?

**[01:22:56 - 01:22:56]** Professor's room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:57 - 01:22:58]** Oh, professor's room is lower.

**[01:22:58 - 01:22:58]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:58 - 01:22:59]** It's on the other side of the fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:23:00 - 01:23:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:23:01 - 01:23:01]** Okay.

**[01:23:01 - 01:23:04]** So, Rick, you get a plus four to your reflex save to jump through the fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:23:05 - 01:23:06]** Is it a reflex or an acrobatics?

**[01:23:06 - 01:23:07]** It's a reflex.

**[01:23:08 - 01:23:09]** Oh, good.

**[01:23:09 - 01:23:10]** Because my reflex is better.

**[01:23:11 - 01:23:14]** Ah, 17 plus four plus another four.

**[01:23:14 - 01:23:16]** It's a lot of math.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:23:16 - 01:23:21]** Yeah, you are very capable of spraying and then quickly running through.

**[01:23:21 - 01:23:30]** You still take two points of damage because the fire just, like, goes through some of your armor there on your feet as you're trying to go through.

**[01:23:30 - 01:23:31]** It spreads very quickly.

**[01:23:32 - 01:23:35]** So stepping in it quickly, like a couple catch, and they quickly go out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:23:35 - 01:23:38]** Rick starts breathing heavy because he just ran out of stamina.

**[01:23:38 - 01:23:38]** Oof.


## Speaker_0

**[01:23:39 - 01:23:39]** Oof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:23:39 - 01:23:54]** This is... I'm going to tell, as I jump, before I jump through the flames, I'm going to tell, here's, don't worry, I've got medpacks for you on the other side.

**[01:23:54 - 01:23:55]** Just make it through.

**[01:23:55 - 01:23:56]** Just make it through.

**[01:23:56 - 01:23:58]** And I jump through.

**[01:23:58 - 01:24:01]** And Rick continues to... I gotta...

**[01:24:01 - 01:24:02]** It's plus four.

**[01:24:03 - 01:24:06]** Plus whatever you already have, yeah, for your reflex save.

**[01:24:06 - 01:24:08]** So I have a reflex plus one.

**[01:24:08 - 01:24:10]** I rolled a 15 plus four.

**[01:24:10 - 01:24:10]** That's 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:24:10 - 01:24:13]** Yeah, so you also take two damage as you go through the fire.

**[01:24:13 - 01:24:17]** Like, as soon as you spray it, it quickly, like, quickly comes through.

**[01:24:17 - 01:24:19]** This ship is a no joke.

**[01:24:19 - 01:24:21]** Like, you could die on the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:24:21 - 01:24:26]** Rick on the other side of the fire is still spraying the fire extinguisher.

**[01:24:26 - 01:24:27]** Trying to help people coming through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:24:27 - 01:24:29]** Yeah, okay.

**[01:24:29 - 01:24:31]** So Dr. Okay is through.

**[01:24:31 - 01:24:32]** Rick is through.

**[01:24:32 - 01:24:34]** Here's.

**[01:24:34 - 01:24:34]** You're up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:24:35 - 01:24:36]** Here's rolled a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:24:36 - 01:24:38]** A 17.

**[01:24:38 - 01:24:39]** Is that with a plus four?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:24:40 - 01:24:41]** Yeah, with the plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:24:41 - 01:24:49]** You are able to make it through, and then right as Hears jumps through, Rick is spraying, and you just hear the fire extinguisher start to sputter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:24:50 - 01:24:52]** It's starting to get low.

**[01:24:52 - 01:24:53]** It's starting to get low.

**[01:24:53 - 01:24:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:24:54 - 01:24:56]** But I can picture the three of you being like, Niko, come on!

**[01:24:57 - 01:24:58]** Come on!

**[01:24:58 - 01:25:00]** And Niko's like, hurry!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:00 - 01:25:00]** Hurry!

**[01:25:00 - 01:25:03]** Niko's checking Dr. Benjamin's wallet for cash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:03 - 01:25:09]** Niko's going to be yelling down the hallway, just be like, don't wait for me!

**[01:25:09 - 01:25:10]** Keep going!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:25:10 - 01:25:12]** It's yours down here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:25:13 - 01:25:15]** So here's... You got through.

**[01:25:15 - 01:25:15]** Okay.

**[01:25:16 - 01:25:16]** What'd you roll, Nick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:18 - 01:25:19]** Uh...

**[01:25:20 - 01:25:21]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:25:21 - 01:25:21]** What'd you roll?

**[01:25:22 - 01:25:23]** Fifteen.

**[01:25:23 - 01:25:25]** Fifteen plus six plus two.

**[01:25:26 - 01:25:27]** Oh, thank God.

**[01:25:27 - 01:25:28]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:25:28 - 01:25:29]** It was DC 15.

**[01:25:29 - 01:25:30]** Amazing.

**[01:25:30 - 01:25:30]** Amazing.

**[01:25:31 - 01:25:41]** You do take two points of damage as you run through because the fire just starts to go or the extinguisher just starts to splutter and it kind of catches you on the back and you feel the heat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:25:41 - 01:25:45]** Does he like, how does he, does he collapse or like, how are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:25:45 - 01:25:46]** Oh, Nico?

**[01:25:47 - 01:25:51]** Nico's just kind of like... He's dead.

**[01:25:52 - 01:25:53]** He's in adrenaline mode right now.

**[01:25:53 - 01:25:55]** Some of him's on fire right now.

**[01:25:56 - 01:25:58]** He's just trying to get down to the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:25:58 - 01:26:00]** Mechanically, you take two damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:00 - 01:26:01]** How's your health?

**[01:26:02 - 01:26:03]** I'm six of 16.

**[01:26:03 - 01:26:05]** Okay, six of 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:26:05 - 01:26:06]** You're fine.

**[01:26:06 - 01:26:07]** Oh, man.

**[01:26:07 - 01:26:08]** You guys are past the fire.

**[01:26:08 - 01:26:10]** You're past the caustic chemicals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:26:11 - 01:26:14]** You're one of 12?

**[01:26:14 - 01:26:15]** One of 12?

**[01:26:15 - 01:26:16]** Stamina.

**[01:26:16 - 01:26:16]** Oh, man.

**[01:26:17 - 01:26:21]** Yeah, here's... He's just rushing into Benjam's room real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:26:21 - 01:26:23]** Here's, okay, you have just a second.

**[01:26:23 - 01:26:26]** The door kind of, you push it open.

**[01:26:26 - 01:26:33]** It comes open, and you do see that some of the room is on fire in the back towards the bathroom.

**[01:26:33 - 01:26:34]** Let me reveal it.

**[01:26:35 - 01:26:43]** You run in, and you see that most of the room looks exactly as it did before, except you can see two things.

**[01:26:43 - 01:26:48]** One, there are four Mark I healing serums that are sitting on the desk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:26:48 - 01:26:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:26:49 - 01:26:50]** Pierce takes those.

**[01:26:50 - 01:26:51]** That's all that you see.

**[01:26:52 - 01:26:53]** You see his luggage.

**[01:26:53 - 01:26:55]** If you want to grab it, that's fine, but you don't remember.

**[01:26:55 - 01:26:58]** It doesn't look like there's much in there except clothes just from looking.

**[01:26:58 - 01:26:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:26:58 - 01:27:00]** What is Hears doing?

**[01:27:00 - 01:27:01]** Nico's going to run into the door.

**[01:27:01 - 01:27:04]** Hears, get the hell out of there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:27:04 - 01:27:04]** We got to go.

**[01:27:05 - 01:27:09]** Hears doesn't see anything else that looks like a place to put something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:27:09 - 01:27:10]** No.

**[01:27:10 - 01:27:12]** There doesn't seem to be anything else there.

**[01:27:12 - 01:27:13]** Hears leaves.

**[01:27:14 - 01:27:15]** Okay.

**[01:27:15 - 01:27:15]** Oh, man.

**[01:27:15 - 01:27:16]** Yeah.

**[01:27:16 - 01:27:19]** Nico comes in and you're like, I got to run.

**[01:27:20 - 01:27:20]** Oh, wow.

**[01:27:21 - 01:27:21]** All right.

**[01:27:21 - 01:27:22]** I'm going to reveal it.

**[01:27:22 - 01:27:34]** You guys are in the long corridor, 10 feet by like 60 feet of air pods, of air pods, escape pods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:34 - 01:27:36]** Are they only one person per?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:27:36 - 01:27:37]** They are one person per.

**[01:27:38 - 01:27:38]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:27:38 - 01:27:39]** Oh, my gosh.

**[01:27:39 - 01:27:40]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:27:40 - 01:27:40]** She just gets in one.

**[01:27:40 - 01:27:44]** As you are running in, Nico, you run to the one that's closest.

**[01:27:44 - 01:27:45]** Then he hears.

**[01:27:45 - 01:27:46]** Then Dr. O.K.

**[01:27:46 - 01:27:49]** Then Rick runs towards the end.

**[01:27:50 - 01:27:52]** And, wow.

**[01:27:53 - 01:28:02]** As you had leapt over the flames and as you run out of the room and as you run into the escape pods, as you're opening...

**[01:28:02 - 01:28:21]** The escape pods, you do feel this familiar sensation kind of creep up the back of your neck and this tingly sensation and time as you're opening the door almost imperceptibly slows noticeably and the heat and the sounds become amplified for a second and you almost can't take it.

**[01:28:21 - 01:28:33]** But your mind suddenly remembers the rush of opening the secret door to the room, of entering into combat against enemies in both cargo holes, of leaping through gas, fire.

**[01:28:34 - 01:28:43]** You're recounting all of your steps, and you're remembering every detail as all of you level up to level three as you get into the escape pods.


## Speaker_0

**[01:28:43 - 01:28:44]** Oh, yeah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:28:44 - 01:28:49]** So how are you feeling as you are approaching and getting into the escape pods?

**[01:28:49 - 01:28:53]** What are the thoughts that are going through your mind as you're leaving this burning ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:28:53 - 01:28:53]** All right.

**[01:28:53 - 01:29:01]** So Nico's thought as he's leaving, Nico's thought as he's leaving is like, all right, I really hope we don't get shot out of here.

**[01:29:01 - 01:29:01]** Here goes nothing.

**[01:29:02 - 01:29:06]** Nick's thought is when we level up, do we get all our health and stamina back right away?

**[01:29:06 - 01:29:09]** No.

**[01:29:09 - 01:29:09]** Okay.

**[01:29:09 - 01:29:10]** Depends on what you're doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:29:10 - 01:29:11]** I don't know.

**[01:29:11 - 01:29:12]** Wow.

**[01:29:13 - 01:29:13]** Yeah.

**[01:29:13 - 01:29:14]** What is everyone else thinking?

**[01:29:14 - 01:29:15]** This is crazy.

**[01:29:15 - 01:29:17]** You definitely could have died.

**[01:29:17 - 01:29:19]** Like, if I had rolled higher, you could have died.

**[01:29:19 - 01:29:22]** It was 3d6 for the fire and the cost of chemicals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:29:23 - 01:29:24]** Yeah, I really could have died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:29:24 - 01:29:25]** Yeah, you could have died.

**[01:29:26 - 01:29:29]** I rolled a five the second time from the fire, so half is two.

**[01:29:29 - 01:29:30]** I mean, that's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:29:31 - 01:29:42]** Rick is relieved that all four of them made it off, but then he starts thinking about everybody else that was on the ship, and he's just so confused at why.

**[01:29:42 - 01:29:44]** Because it wasn't the accident that killed them.

**[01:29:44 - 01:29:49]** Something else happened to Lozu and the pirate, and possibly the other pirates.

**[01:29:51 - 01:29:53]** There is just something not right about this situation.

**[01:29:53 - 01:29:54]** Woof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:29:54 - 01:30:08]** Yeah, Hears is also reflecting on the weirdness of that and then thinking about Dr. Benjams as he heard them to be like his dying words and thinking, oh, wow, how could he really be tied into all of this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:30:08 - 01:30:12]** About that, you'll have to explain that one later.

**[01:30:14 - 01:30:16]** Kevin doesn't understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:30:17 - 01:30:27]** I think Dr. Okay is incredibly fearful and paranoid and has no idea what...

**[01:30:27 - 01:30:47]** to expect next and is just running for his life but also he as he's like leveled up now and like feels stronger and more capable and some like you know he's like more situationally aware perhaps and he he has like

**[01:30:47 - 01:31:10]** it's almost like he's like felt like sort of the rush of combat in a way and he's like he's like i like this he's a little addicted the doctor getting a little addicted locker you're addicted he's just like oh wow he's like addicted to being in this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:31:10 - 01:31:14]** What a nice little insight into a possible road for Dr. Okay.

**[01:31:15 - 01:31:17]** How will you deal with that addiction when you're not in combat?

**[01:31:18 - 01:31:18]** Who knows?

**[01:31:19 - 01:31:21]** Drugs.

**[01:31:21 - 01:31:23]** He's well suited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:31:23 - 01:31:26]** Just like sitting at a bar and he just shoots himself with a drug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:31:26 - 01:31:30]** You need to run.

**[01:31:30 - 01:31:31]** You need to relax.

**[01:31:32 - 01:31:33]** I'm okay now.

**[01:31:33 - 01:31:34]** I'm okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:31:34 - 01:31:38]** Now I'm okay.

**[01:31:38 - 01:31:39]** Fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:31:40 - 01:31:43]** Something about my skin.

**[01:31:43 - 01:31:45]** It's now doctor fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:31:45 - 01:31:47]** We need to be stronger than our skin.

**[01:31:48 - 01:31:50]** We must be strong for our kin.

**[01:31:50 - 01:31:51]** For our kin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:31:51 - 01:31:52]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:31:52 - 01:31:54]** So I got something that I want to say.

**[01:31:56 - 01:32:02]** About a year ago, I wrote something, and Nick, I think you might remember this.

**[01:32:02 - 01:32:05]** I asked Nick to give me some feedback on this piece of music.

**[01:32:06 - 01:32:07]** And thank you, Nick.

**[01:32:07 - 01:32:08]** You gave excellent feedback.

**[01:32:08 - 01:32:09]** It was good.

**[01:32:09 - 01:32:13]** But, of course, I couldn't say what it was or what it was used for or why it was used for.

**[01:32:14 - 01:32:15]** But...

**[01:32:15 - 01:32:19]** Now that we're here, I can shed some light on that.

**[01:32:20 - 01:32:24]** So I tentatively just gave it a name called In Case of Emergency.

**[01:32:25 - 01:32:26]** And I think it fits.

**[01:32:27 - 01:32:30]** So I can picture all of you in this moment.

**[01:32:30 - 01:32:32]** You're on the homestretch.

**[01:32:32 - 01:32:33]** You've gone through.

**[01:32:33 - 01:32:35]** You've seen people collapse in front of you.

**[01:32:35 - 01:32:39]** You are feeling the rush of being up to level three.

**[01:32:39 - 01:32:42]** And it's a physical feeling that you're feeling like this actually happens.

**[01:32:42 - 01:32:45]** It's not just a metagame thing where I'm like, hey, you get to level three.

**[01:32:45 - 01:32:50]** It's like you do have these flashbacks to analyzing every single moment, scrutinizing it.

**[01:32:51 - 01:32:59]** And with all that, I would like you all, even the listener, if you can, I want you guys to close your eyes and to start to picture this scene with me.

**[01:33:01 - 01:33:03]** I'm going to turn this down a little bit for a second.

**[01:33:03 - 01:33:03]** Just listen.

**[01:33:04 - 01:33:05]** See my words.

**[01:33:06 - 01:33:10]** With this in the background, just picture how everything is in slow motion.

**[01:33:10 - 01:33:15]** The four of you spraying the fire extinguisher, coming through, beckoning Nico to come through.

**[01:33:15 - 01:33:18]** Seeing the four of you running down the halls.

**[01:33:18 - 01:33:21]** Past where you fought goblins.

**[01:33:21 - 01:33:23]** Past your own personal rooms.

**[01:33:23 - 01:33:26]** Past where the professor asked for your help.

**[01:33:26 - 01:33:28]** Where you snuck into Trostenec's room.

**[01:33:28 - 01:33:30]** You ding-dong ditched them.

**[01:33:31 - 01:33:33]** Past panels shaking and falling.

**[01:33:34 - 01:33:36]** Sparks and flames coming from every angle.

**[01:33:36 - 01:33:38]** Sweat beating off of your face.

**[01:33:38 - 01:33:42]** A much different ship now.

**[01:33:42 - 01:33:47]** than when you boarded just less than 36 hours ago, it feels.

**[01:33:47 - 01:33:50]** And you all much different as well.

**[01:33:51 - 01:34:04]** The way that your muscles are fatigued from six combats, from tension, stress, exhaustion, from almost probably 12 hours now since you've last rested of uncertainty and near-death experiences.

**[01:34:05 - 01:34:20]** And just picture how the hallway looks and the flashing red and blue emergency lights and the almost a well in the desert of the blue light from the doors to the escape pods.

**[01:34:21 - 01:34:36]** And as this happens, I want you guys to imagine the sounds of the ship, of the burning ship that's falling apart, and it's replaced by music.

**[01:34:38 - 01:34:40]** The camera moves in slow motion down the hall.

**[01:34:41 - 01:34:44]** The fiery, torn-up hallway of the chimera.

**[01:34:44 - 01:34:50]** Thick, acrid smoke clears as ahead we see the escape pod doors, sheathed in blue emergency lighting.

**[01:34:51 - 01:34:53]** All the doors are closed now except for Dr.

**[01:34:53 - 01:34:57]** O.K., who's inside but trying to pull the door of the escape pod shut.

**[01:34:58 - 01:35:08]** It's stuck, so he's pulling once, twice as the camera gets closer and closer until the door finally swings free as we move into the door and blackout.

**[01:35:08 - 01:35:12]** From outside, we see the cool blue lights of four pods pull away.

**[01:35:13 - 01:35:19]** Inside, you feel a brief moment of weightlessness as the clamps release that preceded the g-force of the rocketing pod.

**[01:35:20 - 01:35:23]** The sense of sudden acceleration pulls your eyes to the console.

**[01:35:24 - 01:35:26]** You instinctively grab the throttle, but the pod doesn't respond.

**[01:35:27 - 01:35:32]** Looking down, you only see the same strange geometric symbol on the relic on the screen.

**[01:35:33 - 01:35:40]** A flicker catches your eye and looking back you see the Chimera falling away as small explosions rip through it.

**[01:35:40 - 01:35:49]** However, instead of the darkness of space, you see a cavernous room that surrounds the ship you knew as the Chimera.

**[01:35:49 - 01:35:54]** Thick cables, some of which are on fire, suspend the ship in the center of the chamber.

**[01:35:55 - 01:36:01]** The corrugated metal walls and ceiling just visible in the firelight are showing flickering images of space.

**[01:36:01 - 01:36:09]** Three massive pistons are attached to the chimera's underside, built to move the ship as if it were in flight or suffered an impact.

**[01:36:09 - 01:36:15]** A protruded set of walls and a telescoping corridor look like they could extend to the side airlock for boarding.

**[01:36:15 - 01:36:19]** All of this underneath the wide window of some sort of empty control room

**[01:36:19 - 01:36:32]** Among all this fakery, the explosions blow the chimera apart until the ship is engulfed in one large explosion as you feel the pods race forward into darkness.

**[01:36:32 - 01:36:39]** As you all realize that you don't know where these escape pods are headed and that there's nothing that you can do to stop them.

**[01:36:40 - 01:36:41]** End of book one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:36:42 - 01:36:45]** Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:36:47 - 01:36:47]** Oh!
