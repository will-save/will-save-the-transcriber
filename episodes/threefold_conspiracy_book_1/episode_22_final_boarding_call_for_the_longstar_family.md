## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:05]** Last time on We'll Save, Interrogation.

**[00:00:05 - 00:00:19]** After subduing the would-be Trostenec, the group discovers that the Trostenec they've been fighting is really a shape-shifting Astrozoan part of a pirate gang called the Starfishers.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:27]** After further questioning, they discover that there are three Astrozoans, one impersonating the captain,

**[00:00:27 - 00:00:36]** the next impersonating Trostenec, and the last one might be impersonating the mysterious Algiada.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:43]** An explosion is felt a few decks up, and the group's captive goes from asset to liability.

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:45]** What happened to the ship?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on We'll Save...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** Here's a question.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** Here's a thought piece.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:44]** A little thought experiment.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** More so about your PCs.

**[00:01:49 - 00:02:02]** What deity does your character believe in or think about, talk to, have tea with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:05]** I think Nico can start off here.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** Okay.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:10]** While in the world of Starfinder, we know the gods are real.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:25]** I think Nico and I think Nico's family in general have kind of inherited this belief that if these gods truly are gods, then why is the universe and the solar system such a cruel place?

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** So in that sense, they're kind of atheists.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:32]** Nico is atheist in that sense as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:34]** Wait, why is the universe a what place?

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Such a cruel place.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** The gods are cruel.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Interesting.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:48]** But there are benevolent gods that you can believe in who, like, want good, and they exist.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** True, true.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** So you could just help them out, right?

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:58]** Like, it's not just... It's like the forces of good and evil and neutral gods.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** So there's, like, a war of deities happening in the background.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** Oh.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** I don't know if there's a war, but, I mean, there are tensions.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** Like, they are things.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** They're beings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** Has anybody read American Gods?

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:09]** No.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Oh, it is phenomenal.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** What's it about?

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** It's about that.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:17]** It's about the old gods from, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** Like Astrozone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:29]** Like Odin and some African gods like Anani, the spider god.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:35]** They come to America with believers that migrated to America.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:41]** But then now in the modern day, there are gods that are being developed.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:51]** There's a god of the highways, and there's a god of the internet, and it ends up becoming a battle between the gods of old and the gods of new.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:54]** It's a show as well, isn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:59]** Yeah, it sounds like a religious version of Guns, Germs, and Steel.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** Never heard of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** Guns, Germs, and Steel is good.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** Guns, Germs, and Steel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:12]** But that was... Okay, but that's... I'll say this.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]** There's a lot of problems with that book.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:21]** That the author, Diamond, I believe, even brought up.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** Like, oh, I was totally wrong about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:31]** Well, let's get back to the world of Starfinder before we go too deep into Guns, Germs, and Steel.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** Yeah, I'll say this, though.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:41]** I know that you said that you're a little bit atheistic, but I think maybe it sounds like you just don't trust the gods.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** Does atheistic mean that you don't believe in them?

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** Because they definitely exist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:52]** It's kind of like a Tywin Lannister approach to the gods, so to speak.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:58]** Where he believes that they're all just such vindictive people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** Childish.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:03]** Childish desires.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** Even like Yomadai.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Yomadai?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** Because Yomadai doesn't help everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:17]** Is a truly good God somebody who helps everyone, Nick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:17]** Right.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:19]** This is a big question.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** More like a just God.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:23]** Yom and I believe in justice and valor, lawful good.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:24]** So, question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:31]** Can a judge be good if he just forgives everybody?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** Yeah, I mean.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** That doesn't make a judge good, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:41]** You would say that's a bad judge, so anyone who's a supreme judge over anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:46]** This is getting a lot deeper than we thought it would go.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** Yeah, which is fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:50]** You made the mistake of bringing this up.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:55]** I totally opened a can of worms, and it all happened with a text or something in a business meeting.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:58]** I was like, oh, by the way, think of your gods before the next session.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** And then now we're super deep.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:24]** uh into something we didn't mean to be here nico i'll ask you one more question because i find your position so intriguing if there was one god that you might at all like lean on think about use like abadar would it be abadar and why is it abadar it probably there's a bank it probably would be it probably would be abadar just for the reason that he's the god of commerce

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:39]** And, like, the Avatar Corp is a literal corporation, like, for, started by, founded by, it's like the worship of Avatar, and they're, like, one of the, if not the largest company, you know, in the pack of worlds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:41]** Nico thinks they're corrupt, too, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:53]** Just for our followers who aren't aware, I know we've already mentioned that there are gods that exist, but they are very defined gods for each and every thing.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:57]** And you can actually read about it in the Core Rulebook on page 482.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:01]** Yes, thank you, Core Rulebook lawyer.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** Thanks, Core Rulebook.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:03]** Yeah, CRBL.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:04]** Are you done, Nick?

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** Can I go now?

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:05]** Go.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:06]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** Are you done?

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Are you done?

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** Are you done, son?

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** Are you done yet?

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:12]** We get it.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:14]** You don't like any gods.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:14]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:18]** You don't like the idea of worshipping a god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** You don't even need to worship them.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** It's just like they literally exist.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:24]** They're just the big boss of the Abaddon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** I think it's known that they're all real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:32]** I think in the world of Starfinder, it's less of worship and more of follow.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** If that makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:35]** I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't agree.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:37]** I could see that from my God for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:39]** But like, you can follow an actual person.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:44]** You can follow a, a, like in the real world or like, yeah, you could be a follower, support them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** You could support them.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:49]** You could be like, yeah, like, isn't that a form of worship?

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:52]** But then we're just getting into semantics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** Now you're splitting hairs.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** What is worship, right?

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:00]** So, Kevin, what's your god?

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** Look, so we get it.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** You really want to get deep on this?

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:08]** Everyone just wants an edgy character that doesn't believe in the gods and the world where we know the gods exist.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:12]** We're all over edgy and lone wolves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** Rick is actually quite the opposite then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:15]** Okay.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** The standout.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:16]** He's an android.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** How would that even...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** Well, he still has a history.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** What, androids can't have a god?

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** I guess they can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:25]** Androids can't follow people and worship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** Can't worship.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** Fair enough.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:27]** I'm sorry, Kevin.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** That was a very unkind thing of me to say.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:30]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:39]** No, Rick actually, he grew up in a family that was very devout to Lao Shu Po, or the Grandmother Rat.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** Yeah.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:44]** He grew up on Akitan, and his family was all very devout with them.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:58]** But as he got, you know, quote-unquote older, because Androids don't really age, he started actually working for the Abador Corps and working within the bank system as a security guard.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:09]** And he was drawn to Abador because of lawfulness and the goodness that the god actually reaches for.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:15]** And so he became a pretty devout follower of Abador and the Abador core.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:19]** because of the lawfulness and goodness that he saw in that.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:24]** So like they were driven by money, but like it was righteous in that sense.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** So he's actually for the law.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** Yeah.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:42]** And he's actually like at odds with his family when it comes to religion, because he's trying to pull his family out of what he thinks is like this archaic old God and, and trying to basically get them to follow into the Abador, you know, way of life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:43]** Hmm.


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:43]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:54]** it's a tough must make holidays tough but that was all before he became a slave and then that got for you to be like a lot about rick like in the west

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:18]** yeah 45 seconds a lot going on damn yeah damn impressive um here's uh or yeah i'll go um so here's like most pirates follows bez mara um but like most pirates are not particularly religious so only in times of extreme need does he really call on her um yeah and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** I think that's a good distinction.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:27]** The gods exist, but that doesn't mean that you're religious because there is a religion, but they're deities.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:31]** You can be both, kind of, or be a little bit... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:38]** I mean, it's kind of someone you would talk to on your deathbed and kind of when you need to check in and see, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:41]** Yeah, but that's the craziest thing is that they could actually come to your deathbed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** They literally could.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** They could be like, yo, here's... You know what?

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** I dig it.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:46]** I like it.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** They could enter the room and be like...

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** Yeah, be like, you're cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** I like your juju.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:55]** Thanks for being a pirate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** Thank you, Besmara.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:03]** Thank you for the 31 years of being a loyal follower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** Correct.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:12]** One more thing, which is kind of a cool fact about Besmara, is her symbol is the Jolly Roger, which is pretty awesome.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:12]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** I like the good old-fashioned Jolly Roger flag.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** Good old-fashioned Jolly Roger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** What about the good doctor?

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** So, I mean, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:25]** Not Will, but Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** Yeah, not me.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** Yeah.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** But also me.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:29]** But also you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** Who is Dr. Okay, Will?

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** Is Will Dr. Okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** Yeah.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:45]** Osharo's religion and science are, according to all the research that I've been able to look at...

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:56]** They regard religion and science as like the same, which, you know, incidentally, I sort of also look at it.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:58]** You will.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** Yeah.

**[00:11:59 - 00:11:59]** Yeah.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:04]** So, I mean, like they they worship Yara Issa.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:31]** um and devote basically all of osharu society is sort of centered around science and scholarship and knowledge and like perfecting knowledge and so they dedicate you know we osharus dedicate uh all of our discoveries to yara isa nice nice

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:50]** patron of learning and science and so we you know we look at our our work as as part of that worship and and dedication of studying of different fields and sharing that knowledge in those discoveries with other races um

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:57]** Yeah, we have a particular passion for sharing those epiphanies and higher learning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** All in the name of Yara Issa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** All in the name of Yara Issa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** That's cool.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** It's cool.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:05]** Because those things are real.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:17]** The drift that you guys are in was literally shown to Maid, debated which one it is, to mortals because of three gods that came together to become triune.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:22]** It was the god of, like, machine folk, the god of the android race, and the god of clockwork technology.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:28]** And then they literally were like, yo, here's the drift in some drift beacons and the star stone in Absalom Station.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** Like, that is now part of your economy.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:38]** So in that same way, all the work that the Osharos do is, like, who can say that some of that is from your work?

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:45]** Some of that might be Yara Issa influencing your work because the gods literally make these things happen in Impact Worlds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:45]** Yes.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** That is cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:51]** It's like the spirit working within.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:52]** Yes.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:58]** All the research and science and all the things under the sun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:04]** Abadar is in the credits, the cred sticks, just like the files are in the computer.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** That's what you're saying, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** Do you want to buy some cred sticks?

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** You don't want to sell me cred sticks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** For commerce, yes.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:18]** But, I mean, the technology to make it happen, the knowledge of such wonders is from Yarisa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** Yeah, like those epiphanies.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:23]** Were those you or were those Yarisa?

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Who knows?

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:27]** When Dr. K just has one of those brilliant ideas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** Yarisa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** I roll my wisdom check to Yarisa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:33]** Nice.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** I hope you rolled well.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:43]** Real quick, because I really want to get to playing because I want you guys to find out what's behind door number two.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:49]** But before we get there, I just want to say last time some little rules clarifications.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:56]** I think one was that we talked about moving and then attacking and then moving, but we corrected that mistake in game.

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:07]** We might have made that before, but I'm glad that we caught it because it's a big difference between Starfinder and some of the other systems that are out there, whatever they may be, whatever names they may have that no one knows.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** Definitely not D&D.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:09]** Nope.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Not those two letters together.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Separated by an ampersand.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:15]** Absolutely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:17]** No, I was talking about D&D as in do not disturb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:18]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** See?

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** Exactly.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:20]** That's what I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** I don't even know what you're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** The name's already taken.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** The name's already taken.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:34]** But here's something that I think came up that some of you at home, probably no one, but something like five people might have been like, that's not right.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:37]** And it's the fact that Magic Missile can deal non-lethal damage.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:38]** That's right.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:40]** And I just want to say that I did my GM homework.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:58]** I think that my ruling makes sense, that if you can cast Magic Missile that is literally force damage, like force energy, you can make it to be non-lethal, to change how the magnitude of it, the amplitude of it.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:00]** But I'm a loose interpretation guy.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** It doesn't say that you can't do it.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** That's true.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** It does not say you can't.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:11]** I will abide by the fact that you can't target specific body parts because it's just kind of like this.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:14]** It's not technically an attack, I think, right?

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:16]** Because you don't roll for it.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** So it is something that you just release.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:19]** But...

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:22]** I just wanted to give the floor to see if anybody else had anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** Do you do everything that Paizo tells you to do?

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:24]** Everything.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** Everything to the letter?

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:29]** And everything that they don't tell you to do, you don't do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:32]** I mean, when you're playing a game, you should follow the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** Do you wash your hands after you go to the bathroom?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:36]** Look, it's definitely the rule of cool.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** Because Paizo didn't tell you.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** I think that's a very cool ruling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** That's in the core rulebook.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** Wash your hands is in the core rulebook.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** Page four.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** It literally says...

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Like, have fun.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** These are, like, for you, you know?

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:50]** And we follow them for the most part.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** Because the game is balanced that way.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:59]** But I like the idea that, like, there are just some things that, you know, you've got to bend the rules a little bit.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** That's me.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:04]** Maybe this leads to here's just not lethally attacking everybody with magic missile.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** And then at that point...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:23]** we'll revisit it well here's we'll be i'm sure uh conscientious about this kind of stuff and um and but what thank you john i enjoy that ruling very much it's very helpful so it's it's certainly sorry i think there's got to be some kind of limitation especially if you're wait why why


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:29]** But there is a limitation that you can't target certain body parts and it's not technically an attack.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:35]** So other things that rely on you making an attack wouldn't – like magic missile wouldn't count for better or for worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:41]** But in the book it does say to make a lethal weapon non-lethal, you take a minus four to your attack roll.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:44]** Magic missile doesn't have an attack roll.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** So there has to be some kind of –


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:52]** So you're saying that because it is not technically an attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:54]** I get what Kev's saying.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:54]** Me too.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:57]** It's like skirting around.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:59]** I'm just saying there has to be some kind of limitation.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:01]** So maybe make him roll a D100.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:05]** But why does there have to be a limitation, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** Just do the damage.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** Let's kill them all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:10]** No.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:12]** It's very useful to keep a lot of these guys alive.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** And...

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:17]** I feel like the ruling has been... It's been ruled.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** Don't need to revisit this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:23]** You're saying so we could torture them.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:23]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:27]** That's what you're saying.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** That's a very good imitation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** I don't know.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:34]** I just feel like you should be...

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:41]** If that's the case, it feels like when you want to cast it, you're like, and you just have no control over it.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** You're like, here you go.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:44]** It's a bunch of magic missiles going your way.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:46]** It's like, I don't know.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:49]** You've got a little more finesse over it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** It's a cool attack that is made even cooler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:57]** This isn't our D&D game where Kelly's character has to roll for wild magic, though, either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** Or is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** Or is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:03]** How about, okay, that could be a thing that we could do.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** But this makes up for the wild magic.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:08]** So all that period of time I had to spend doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:19]** So what you're saying is that, are you suggesting that if you want to cast magic missile non-lethally, you're saying let's roll for it, which was Kev's, I think, idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** You roll for wild magic?

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** I honestly wouldn't mind...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** Well, I don't know.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:28]** I'd have to think about the wild magic thing.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:30]** Is there any sort of thing in this universe for that?

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** I'm saying 50-50.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:33]** Yeah, thank you, Will.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** I'm saying 50-50.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:37]** And we'll just say above 50, this is it.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:44]** If we ever talk about it again, just somebody tweet us and be like, episode 22, first 10 minutes, you guys set the ruling.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:47]** Above 50, what?

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** Lethal, non-lethal?

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:50]** Lethal, below 50.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:54]** No, you guys.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:58]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:00]** I like this already.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** This is great.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** I am totally open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** Someone keep track of the house rules?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:06]** Yeah, it's on the house.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** In our notes page.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:10]** The house is keeping track of the house rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** Thank you, Will.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** It's called the Kelly Special.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** The Kelly special.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:16]** Thank you, Kevin.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** Thank you very much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** Fools lawyer.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:26]** That didn't sound... Yeah, that was super... We had a great thing going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** It was going just so well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:33]** But, you know, I'm down with it because the more that you can roll your dice, the better.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** That does sound kind of interesting.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:40]** The whole point of the game is rolling the dice, so we'll just have it be like that.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:40]** Did you roll?

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:46]** Okay, I think it's a little much to retroactively go back.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** We're not going to retcon.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:52]** We've already taken our hands off the chess piece from here on out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:55]** I had a failure sound just queued up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** I think you should still play it just so we all know.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:01]** Or do you want to sing it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** Oh, that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:03]** Oh, that's perfect.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** What's that from, Mario or Yoshi?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:07]** That's Pac-Man.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:08]** Pac-Man.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** Allegedly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:11]** Allegedly.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:13]** Depends on if you believe in Pac-Man or not.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** If you accept that they're real.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:15]** I don't.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:21]** Then it looks like that sound doesn't apply to you.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:25]** Let it be known how edgy Nico is.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:28]** Nico doesn't believe the cap is real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:34]** Did we do enough witty banter to start this episode?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:35]** I think we did.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:37]** We hit our witty banter cap a long time ago.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** We might edit it out.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:39]** We might not.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:41]** We'll just throw it in the next episode.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:41]** It's fine.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:44]** Now that's an avocado-eating dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** An avocado-eating dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:51]** You all saw an avocado-eating dog, and that's how this adventure began.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:57]** What really happened is that you all...

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:23]** discovered a secret room let's let's flash forward a little bit from the fact that we know you're on a ship some things happened some people might or might not have disappeared some people might have might not have been attacked by asteroid lice yeah people might or might not have been shape-shifting space besides the point not really to the how do you say what's the plural for octopus

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** Octopi?

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:25]** Octopi.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** Octopuses?

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** Octopi.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:27]** Okay.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:28]** Astrozoans.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** That's the plural of octopus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:32]** Yeah.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:32]** Astrozoans.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:34]** So you find a secret room.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:41]** You're confronted by the one person that you thought was all cozy in their room, enjoying some hot chocolate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:46]** But they finished that hot chocolate and they said, I need to keep, I need to leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:53]** And then you all took them out, interrogated them, found out some information about the starfishers.

**[00:22:54 - 00:23:24]** band of pirates that will be here shortly as they said and then you proceed to hear an explosion small one above you you collect your things collect what you need and start heading up the secret ladder you come to two doors to your right and to your left in this ladder and

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:30]** And there's a seemingly door hatch above you another 10 feet.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:34]** You stop midway up this tube, this hatch.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:37]** Tube.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** And you listen at the door on the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** You hear some voices.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:44]** And you're like, I'm going to go to door number two on the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:51]** So you go, and I believe you rolled a 12, Rick, to stealthily open door number two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:53]** Are you asking me to remember that?

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** Because you know I have the memory of a goldfish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** No, I'm saying that because I remembered it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:59]** No offense to goldfishes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** We're sorry.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:04]** I am only here to offend goldfishes.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** They won't remember anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:10]** We probably should have gotten that out on episode one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:13]** That was the whole impetus for this entire podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** That's pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:18]** Kelly, you are the funniest person I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** It's true.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** Only accidentally.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:22]** Seriously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:26]** Kelly has those subtle one-liners that you're just like, that was so good.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** That was so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** All right, we'll call it a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** We'll call it a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:34]** So Rick stumbles and kicks the door open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** I'm going to wait for a sec because Nick left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** It's dark in there.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:41]** Where did Nick go in the middle of action?

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** I don't know.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** This is a strange place.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** It is strange.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:47]** Oh, welcome back.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:50]** Boy, you know, it's eerie in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** Welcome back, Nick.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:53]** You missed out on everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** I always do.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** So, Nick, that was the end of book one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:01]** Oh, if only you know what happened to your character, Nick.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** Oh, my God.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** Just wait until you hear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** It's going to be crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** I'll re-roll a new one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** We're good.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:07]** All right.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:08]** Three, two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** It's dark in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:10]** Yeah.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** Three, two, one.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:11]** Back in.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** We're back in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** Back in the game.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:14]** I don't know.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:19]** I feel like I'm going to keep some of those jokes like Nick left and then quickly like seconds of silence.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:23]** So, Rick, you open the door.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:33]** And as the door slides open, let me reveal it here on the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:40]** You see... Is every door in this ship operated by, like, pneumatics?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:44]** It's operated by a laugh track.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:48]** By a laugh track.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:55]** You see the back of containers and crates.

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:07]** And looking up, you recognize the familiar walls and ceiling of the starboard cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** This is the cargo bay.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:12]** We never went down the hall on the other side, did we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:15]** I thought we searched for, like, secret entrances.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:18]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** I guess we couldn't necessarily find them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:22]** We didn't realize there were secret entrances back then.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** Hindsight being 20-20.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:28]** But the other door, the door to the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:34]** Right as you're thinking that, you hear, Who's there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** From further, deeper in the cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** Can we tell whose voice it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** It's probably, it's a starfisher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** Doesn't sound like a familiar voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:53]** Can I, I'm going to roll a, can I roll a wisdom check to see if I know what the other side of the cargo thing is?

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** Or not the other side of the cargo, but the other door?

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:56]** Sure.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** Someone over there?

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** Nope.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** He has no idea.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:03]** I rolled a three and I think I have a zero on wisdom or something.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:07]** So I'm going to roll a stealth to try to duck behind the boxes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:09]** Okay.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:12]** So you come out, give me your stealth check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** Natural 20.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:14]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:19]** And it's a plus one for 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:22]** My stealth's old enough to drink.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** For 21.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:25]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:27]** That's funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** Yeah, I mean, I'll say this.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:35]** You definitely get there and feel like you are good to go.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:38]** If you want to move, I will reveal this area.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** You step in.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:42]** You are stepping on top of a cargo cart right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:42]** I can't see.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** It's all blocked out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** That's fine.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** I'll reveal it.

**[00:27:47 - 00:28:12]** as you step in you see over to the right you see the cargo bay as you normally understand it but you also see polygon reveal here you see the door to the cargo bay open seems to be like a bunch of stuff in there that that creates this like low wall and you can see

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** A little bit past it.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:17]** Nico, you are right behind, and you heard all this happen.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:19]** I'm pretty sure you were right behind Rick.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:27]** Nico's going to follow Rick, and he got a natural 16 on his roll, and he's got a pretty high modifier.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:34]** He's got a plus 8 on the modifier, so that's going to be a 24 for his roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** 24.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** Okay.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** And where do you go?

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:37]** For what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:38]** Stealth?

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:39]** Stealth.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Yeah, roll for stealth.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** And where do you go?

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:45]** He's just going to go right there behind Rick.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:49]** Someone's over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:51]** They better tell me before I shoot them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** Sorry, where are the voices coming from?

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:53]** Street ahead?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** Further in the cargo bay.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** No, not outside.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:58]** More like over here.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:05]** But since you all ducked in, you can't really quite see over there yet, which is why I haven't revealed it.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:08]** So you're currently hidden in the southern portion of the cargo hold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:15]** Here's where we'll stealthily move to this location.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:22]** I can't point it out, but behind this gray barrel above this giant crate, it looks like there is... Right there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:22]** Okay, cool.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** All right, give me your stealth check.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:27]** It's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** Yeah, it's a two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:32]** It's a two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:34]** So fantastic.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:34]** Yeah.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** So you move over there.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** Let's get to that, to what happened in a second.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** Dr. O'K, what do you do?

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:46]** Because this is all, we're not in combat per se, but this is all like kind of happening at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:49]** So I'm trying to see what each of you do.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:57]** is going to, because this person presumably hears one of us or some of us, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:00]** They can be hearing somebody else for all we know.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:04]** I mean, the thing is that here's hit a barrel.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:22]** I'm going to walk up here and I'm going to pretend like I'm looking for like more supplies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** Okay.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:27]** So I feel like here starts to go in front of you.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:27]** Right.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:32]** And then you go behind him when you realize the element of surprise might not be good.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** You might not have it on your side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:34]** Yes.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:47]** And so I'm going to say, I need to find more of these medical supplies.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** Where do they store them?

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** Do you?

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:54]** Excuse me, sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** Oh, God.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** Nico, look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** This is so good.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:00]** This is better than I could have ever imagined it to be.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:02]** I've been so excited to play all week.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** Go, Nico, go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:09]** Nico's looking over at Rick, and he lets out an audible sigh and rolls his eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:13]** But you guys are still concealed.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** That's true.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:16]** They are concealed, as far as you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:19]** He's really more rolling his eyes than he hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:26]** So let me tell you what you guys see as you walk over before you move, Rick, because I saw your little token move.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:31]** So here's a Dr. K walk into the open, Nico and Rick hidden in the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:46]** I'm holding, like, my Costa Jet liquidator as well as the med pack, like, looking for more med packs, like a boxing, you know, holding it up to, like, the side of, like, crates to try and find similar markings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:47]** I'll say this.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:50]** Give me a deception or a bluff.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** Sorry.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:51]** Yeah.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Go for the bluff roll.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** Give me a quick bluff.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** Give me a quick bluff-a-roo.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** 24 seconds.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** Four.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:06]** I love when ridiculous things happen and they roll well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:08]** They work out.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** Impressive.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:10]** Okay.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** But it probably doesn't beat shit.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:15]** This is what you see as you come in.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** This is so perfect.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:17]** I love this.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:18]** I love this game.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:19]** This is great.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:26]** In the center, a bit towards the back, you see a dwarf creature.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** Standing in armor.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:36]** Probably almost... It's like very garish.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** Seems very evil.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** Dark red.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:42]** Black, long, dirty hair.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:51]** And she has a grin that seems like she's very excited at seeing the two of you.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:54]** But of more interest...

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:04]** is that in the center of the cargo bay, you see Song lying motionless on the floor.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Oh, God.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:05]** Song.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** Not Song.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:12]** Dr. O'Key, as you first hear this comes out, then Dr. O'Key, the dwarf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** What did you say you were looking?

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** Wait.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:23]** Stand up behind that barrel over there.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Is that who I think it is?

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** Who's over there?

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** I saw you come out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:37]** Have you seen any more of these?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:41]** I haven't seen those.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:44]** But there's someone over there next to you, slug.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** Tell him that there's no one here.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Tell him.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** Bluff him, bluff him.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** Do another bluff.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** You're really good at that.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** I literally saw you over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** She takes a step forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:11]** That might have been my... I have a funny... Roll the bluff check real quick.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:15]** Because you're not doing so hot on the words.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:21]** I got a 21.


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** Ravens!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** That's outrageous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** So you're saying there's.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** You see.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** Look, come here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:34]** Come here right now.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:34]** Come here.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** You see, obviously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** Or else you're going to end up like them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** Come here.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:43]** Can I get you something to relax?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** I don't need anything to relax.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** I want everything you have.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:50]** And you need to come step over here right now.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:52]** Or else I'm going to turn you into toast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** Well, okay.

**[00:34:54 - 00:35:00]** What I've got right here is this medical apparatus to help some people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** Put everything you have on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** Put everything you have on the ground.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** You put the costa jet?

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** No, no, no.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** Okay.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:11]** I'm holding the med pack.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:13]** Okay.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** Diorama.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** Diorama med pack.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** Yeah.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:18]** And I administer it to someone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** Okay.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:22]** Stop.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** Don't.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:27]** Just as you're about to reach over, unless you want to try and stop it, she's like, stop.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:27]** Don't.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Don't touch them.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** Don't touch them.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Just put everything you have on the ground.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:35]** What are Nico, Hears, and Rick doing?

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** Hears is going to pop up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:41]** And first thing that he observes, by the way, is that this dwarf has a beard.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:45]** Is it like Lord of the Rings rules where, like, female dwarves also have beards?

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:48]** No.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:51]** This is what she looks like.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** She's beautiful.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:54]** Dude, she's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:55]** Okay.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** She's got a lot of robotic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** She's got a lot of facial hair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:00]** It's pretty lush.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:02]** Yeah, she's very evil looking.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:04]** Can you put them up again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** Her up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:05]** Is that her?

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:06]** That's her.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** That's her, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:12]** I might or might not have the exact pawn for it, per se, but that is roughly her.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** I was just very curious.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** Very intense.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:18]** She also has a robotic arm?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:20]** Yeah, robotic arms and lots of armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:21]** No, no.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:22]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:22]** Okay.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:25]** That was just the cool thing that I wanted to have in there.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:29]** She doesn't seem to have a robotic arm, even though the image shows it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:32]** Here's Will kind of like...

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:40]** This is going to pop up and just kind of have the magic missiles, some magic missiles kind of floating by his head.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:45]** And he's going to try to threaten this woman, this dwarf woman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:45]** Oh, man.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** OK.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:53]** So I imagine her looking down at Dr. OK, who's about to administer some of the song, and then here steps up and she looks over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** I knew you were there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** What do you say here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** I don't know who the hell you are.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:02]** And then... You don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:04]** And then he's like, you gotta stop it.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Put your weapon down.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:07]** While... He rolled a 19.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Intimidate.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:10]** He is engaging with the dwarf.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:11]** Uh-huh.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** We don't know his... Her name.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:16]** But... Uh... I'm gonna... I'm gonna shoot.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** Okay.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** Let's do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:21]** Well, one... I didn't intimidate her for 19.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** Does she, like... Okay.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** Stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** You... Intimidate her for 19.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** Yeah.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:27]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** I think you need to make a stealth roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:38]** Rick would like, he's going to put away his pistol and pull out his artillery laser.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** Okay.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** Do you want me to roll a stealth for that or can I just do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:47]** I think, give me a stealth roll to make sure you don't roll like a natural one.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** I got a 14.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** You got a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:53]** Also, Nico wants to make sure he has both of his blasters out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:56]** Okay, so Nico, yeah, it kind of makes sense.

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:05]** I feel like you said you were coming up the ladder with one, and then now that you realize you might be in a dire situation, you're like, I'm going to need both here.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** I rolled a seven.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:06]** Seven.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:07]** Okay.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:13]** So there's definitely a moment where it hits the crate and she kind of hears.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:17]** You see her notice something over to the left.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:24]** But as you say that hears, her face just gets stony.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:29]** And she says, here's.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:58]** don't remember me you don't remember that you killed my family in the name of god win a long star i will destroy you roll for initiative exactly that's what i'm talking about that doesn't give you energy i don't know what will i don't know what will what did you do here's here's past always catching up with them


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:02]** Nico got a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:02]** All right.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:04]** Let's go by this one by one.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** Nico, 19.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:10]** What about Rick?

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** 12.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** 12.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** Here's 12.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:17]** 12 as well.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** Who has the higher initiative bonus?

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:21]** Mine is plus zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:22]** I've got plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:23]** Okay.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** So it sounds like Rick will go first.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** Then here's Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:29]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:31]** got a 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** 18.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:32]** Wow.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:34]** Big rolls here.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** Big rolls.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** This is good.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** This is good.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** All right.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:47]** So I think it's safe to assume that she knows, Godwina knows, that somebody is over to the left.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:51]** Nico, it is your turn first.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:54]** What are you going to do next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:59]** Is it my turn as a surprise round or is it my turn just because I'm top of the order here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:07]** You know, I'm going to say because she heard the one thing, I think you're still technically she wouldn't know that you're there.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:11]** So, Dr. O'K, what was your roll on a stealth again?

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** 14.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** 14.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Okay.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:19]** She saw you about to pull that out as she said that.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** She saw your movement.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** So you are not in a surprise round.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:28]** I'll say, Nico, you are the only person in a surprise round because she didn't know that you were there and you didn't do anything wrong.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:28]** To make her know.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** So what do you want to do?

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:31]** Standard action?

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** Move action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:36]** Nico is going to do a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:44]** And John, from right here, will I be able to fire on our...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:47]** I was just, you're stealing my spot.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:54]** But yes, you will be able to because if you go, the rule says you take the corner, one of your corners, right?

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** And you run a straight line to the target.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** And if anything is in the path, then that causes cover.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:03]** So if you're standing behind this, you do have a straight line.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** You would have cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** She would also have cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:07]** No, she wouldn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:12]** Yeah, because one of the paths runs through this box from her corner to that corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:16]** If you go from the corner, is it not snapping?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:20]** I thought that if it was any of the things.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:23]** But it's not just that corner, right?

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** It can be like this corner, right?

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** That goes through a box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:28]** No, I think it's from the nearest corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** No, I think it's from any corner.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Let's look.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:35]** I'm going to contest you on this, rules lawyer.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:40]** Nick, where's my sworn-in induction into the court of... Oh, boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** The court of rules is now in session.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:49]** Our Honorable Judge, Judge John Swan, presiding.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:59]** Tori being represented by the esteemed representative, Kevin Decker, also known as Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:02]** If any line, it says choose a corner of your square.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:09]** If any line from this corner to any corner of the target square passes through a square or border that blocks line of effect or provides cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:13]** Your Honor, choose a corner, not all corners.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:17]** Any corner is what I'm thinking.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Don't break the rules.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** The rules say choose a corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:28]** Then you're just going to choose the corner that will allow you to not have it, but there might be one that has it.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:37]** All right, the legal part of the text says choose a corner, and you're just being nitpicky and choosing the one that would not provide you with anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:43]** I'm pretty sure this plain text reading has been applied to the current rule of order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:50]** Let it be known that I think that the person who's appealing to me is a douchebag for contesting this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** It's okay.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:58]** All the fans that actually care about the rules listening in will definitely come to my side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** I don't know.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:02]** Let's see if they tweet right now in real time.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:03]** Nope.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:06]** No notifications.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** That's unfortunate.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:09]** Looks like no one agrees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** John Swan is suffering.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** John Swan is suffering from the Phantom Menace.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:21]** I move for a vote of no confidence in John Swan's leadership.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:27]** All right, so let's keep this ball rolling, this action ball rolling.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** Nick, you want to move over there?

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** That was a long time to wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:34]** I'm going to move over here, and then he's going to take a shot with one of his pistols because he can't.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** You can't.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:38]** A full action is required to shoot with both weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:41]** You can only do a move action or a standard action on a surprise round.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:44]** Okay, and and you did a move action.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:51]** However, that being said coming out of this you are on the top of round one So it is now your full round for round one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:59]** Oh, now it's just full round Nico's gonna take a full attack on this guy take a full attack Oh Hot diggity dog.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** I like it.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** I like it.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:03]** It's a 16 to hit 16.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** That is a hit.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** That's with one.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Oh Bollocks

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** Next one is a natural zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Okay.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:13]** All right.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** All right.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:17]** So basically, one is a hit.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** When it's not, tell me the damage of that first hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:19]** Wait.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:22]** Unless the O on this dice.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** Wait.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:23]** What O?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** There's no O on a D20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** There's an O on mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:29]** Is that a 20?

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:31]** See, look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** That doesn't look like a D20.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** That's a D20.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** Is it?

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:37]** Is the opposite of that number a one?

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** Then that's a 20.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:39]** It's a crit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:46]** But we have to go back to the rule.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:46]** Which is?

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** The concealment.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** You pick a corner.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:49]** You choose a corner.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:53]** But you have to then check all corners of the enemy.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:58]** And if it borders something, then it is concealment.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Or cover.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:04]** If he checks to this corner, there are three walls of concealment there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:04]** Okay.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** I would say it's partial.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** And even with that, it's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Woo.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** Yeah, so I'm rolling in your favor.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:14]** Let it be known that I do nice things for you.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** What about the first one?

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:18]** Was the first one a hit as well?

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** With a 16, yeah, that's a hit.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:20]** That's fine.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** Okay.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:27]** So give me the damage on the first one, and then let me know if you want to do just a normal crit or if you want to do the critical hit deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:31]** Well, I'll be a fun sport, and we'll do the crit hit deck.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** But my first attack roll.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:33]** Give me the damage.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** It's a four.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** Four.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:46]** Okay, four points of damage to this Godwina Longstar, and then your crit.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Let's see here.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Let me know.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** I'm going to do it.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:49]** Ready?

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** Three, two, one.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** Pull.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:53]** Stop.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:53]** Stop.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** Stop, Chewbacca.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:54]** Stop.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Splash damage.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** Normal damage.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** Bonus effect.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:04]** Creatures adjacent to the target take half damage.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:06]** So that would be Song.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:08]** So Song will take half damage.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:12]** So roll your normal crit damage, which I believe we said rolling twice.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:14]** This seems like a modifier both times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:18]** This seems like a critical failure, not a critical success.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** This is a critical hit deck.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:21]** It's the critical hit deck.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:22]** Hold on.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:29]** Also, our female dwarf here is now on fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:58]** and takes 1d4 burn damage from the azimuth laser pistol that's right instead of using the yeah i feel like you're technically supposed to do that instead oh okay uh yeah yeah so which one do you want you want we'll definitely take the critical burn damage there you don't want to uh hit song they might you know we'll see what happens to them i don't know i don't want to hit song i mean that was definitely like my critical success was a critical failure yeah

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:26]** okay so yeah roll twice add your bonuses both times and then roll the extra d4 and tell me the damage so that's a three for that one plus oh a three again what do you know six and then give me the fire damage oh the oh okay and the fire damage is one point of fire damage okay so seven points of damage yep

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:34]** As this shot just totally hits her and takes her by surprise.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:41]** And you see her shoulder move back and she grimaces at this pain of fire.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:44]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:51]** Nico bends back down behind cover and he's just like, stop, drop and roll that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:53 - 00:48:16]** tell me uh let's keep going let me know if the if she's gonna take damage on any subsequent round because of the i believe she does hold on okay confirm i'm gonna keep going because i want to make sure we're going dr okay what do you do you're right next to her you saw her get pinged by nico what do you do um so was i able to administer the first aid kit to uh she told you to stop i feel like you stopped

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:17]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** Unless you were like, I want to keep going.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** But you could do it now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:25]** Yeah, but there's somebody who wants to fight me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:28]** Or you could just do a medicine check to see what they are at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:33]** Does that count as a full round action?

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** It's a standard action, I think, to use an item.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:43]** I'm going to do, I'm actually just going to, you know, fire.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** Because I have my gun out.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:46]** Yeah.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:49]** I'm going to fire and move to cover.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:52]** And that's what I'm going to do.

**[00:48:55 - 00:49:01]** I'm going to hit our dwarf friend with a minor inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:02]** Okay.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** Which one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:06]** Just the standard minor inhibitor biohack.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** Okay.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:14]** Poses a slight hindrance on a target and takes a minus one penalty to attack rolls for seven rounds.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** Okay.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** Wow.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** It's a long time.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** So give me that roll and hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** I don't know if this one will do it.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** It's 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:30]** 17 hits against KSC.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:46]** uh because you're piercing right so kc yeah that's a hit awesome minor inhibitor minus one to attack rolls for seven rounds right wow nice baller move here hell yeah roll for damage give me the damn damn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** Come on, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** Come on, man.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:53]** Oh, six points of damage.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:53]** Wow.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** Nice.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** There we go.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:59]** I feel like you got right in her neck because she was just not expecting it.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:06]** She was probably looking over at where she was shot from Nico, and that opening was right there, and you took it.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:08]** Wait.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:08]** Amazing.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** Wait.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:09]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** The dart, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:16]** You see her stumble, take a step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** You're crazy, man.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** You're crazy.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:29]** She takes a step back, and as she's walking back, you see her hold up to her wrist.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:31]** Is that her turn?

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** Yeah.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:34]** You see her hold up to her wrist and goes, Cargo bait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** Cargo bait.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** Support now.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** Now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:49]** And then steps behind the crate that is stuck here, getting closer to the door.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Here is a question for myself.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:54]** I feel like using that is another move action.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:55]** So that's her turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:59]** But I still get to move, don't I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:20]** yeah sorry go ahead where do you go yeah i was gonna move um where are you oh okay into this crate okay yeah that is the crate that that trostenek was in yeah so and the real can i see the door the the airlock

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:24]** So you can see that there are doors up here.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** Let me reveal them for you.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** Because this is the same cargo bay, right?

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** This is the same cargo bay.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:34]** You see that these doors up here lead to the forward airlock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:39]** Yeah, this is like the entrance to the airlock, and then there was an airlock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:39]** Right.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** You all went up there.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** The airlock is right past it.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:43]** Okay.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:43]** Okay.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** And then that's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** Yeah.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:47]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:47]** Okay.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:52]** And then I'm going to cut what I did and say that she did all that.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:56]** John, Nick, you have burning damage on my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** You are on fire, right?

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** If it's got burning, you are on fire.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:14]** As long as you have this condition at the start of your turn, each round before you take any actions or attempt the reflex saving throw described below, you take the listed amount of damage as fire damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:15]** Okay.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:19]** That means that you would have taken that damage on your turn, not when you got hit.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:21]** Right.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** So we should be careful of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:23]** Yeah.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** So what was that damage?

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** It was one, right?

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** So I would take the damage now.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** Yes.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** So I would take one now.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** That's fine.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:35]** And the burning condition, at the end of each round, you are burning.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:39]** So at the end of the round, I can attempt a reflex saving throw to remove it.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:39]** Yep.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** Okay.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** That makes sense.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** Sounds good.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** So she still steps back.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** That was her move.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:49]** She moved and used her move action to, I'm going to say, talk into her communicator.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** I feel like that makes sense.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:55]** And she moves back behind this crate.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:58]** It is now Rick's turn.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:58]** What are you doing?

**[00:52:59 - 00:52:59]** Shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** That changes everything.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:04]** Can I roll perception?

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** Well, no, it doesn't matter.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:09]** Are those cargo bay doors open up there?

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** I mean, the airlock doors, are they open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** No, they're not open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** Okay.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:17]** Rick is going to run here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** Okay.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:23]** Closer to the, uh, to the open door into the hallway from the cargo bay into the hallway.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Is this door open?

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** Yes.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** That's why you can see through it.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:31]** And there's this like low barrier there made of some like panels, just a bunch of scraps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:32]** Okay.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:35]** Then, sorry, I'm going to readjust.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** I'm going to move to here.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** Okay.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** Can I roll perception then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** Yeah, you can roll perception.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:44]** So you move along the back wall, the south wall behind Nico.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** And what's your perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:49]** I rolled a four with a plus five of nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:54]** You can see where Godwina is behind the crate.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:59]** And that's all that you can see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Okay.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:06]** I'm going to use my punishment to make fires or open fire.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:29]** to open wait what and then and then use your punishment shoot but i'm going to use my punishment so punishment is a plus one to my attack roll yeah okay as we established last time and then i also get a place plus seven wow i rolled a 17 a 17 12 sorry i rolled 12 12 against 20

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:32]** For EA's... Wait, wait.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** 12, 17, or 20?

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** I rolled a 12.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:34]** Yes.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** It looked like a 17, so I take that back.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:37]** I rolled a 12.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:40]** I have a plus 7 and a plus 1 from that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:40]** So it's 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** 20, yes.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** That's a hit.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:42]** I rolled a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** That's a hit.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** Okay.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:49]** Roll a one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:49]** Roll a one.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** Roll a one.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** I rolled an eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** Wow.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** Impressive.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:57]** Impressive.

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:05]** As he pulls the trigger and the beam is barreling towards this gnome, Rick shouts back at Hears and says...

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:09]** Who is this gnome, and what is your relation to her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** It's a dwarf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** Same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:19]** Whoa, he just kind of throws up his arms, and he's just, like, you know, like, waving like that he doesn't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:25]** You can't really see here's, because here's is still back there, so that's fine.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:36]** That hit, I can totally picture her putting her back to the wall and not seeing you, and then she gets hit and puts out her hands against the wall to brace herself.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:43]** She seems like she is not long for this path, for this packed world.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:48]** Here's, Rick, is that your turn?

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** Yeah, that's my whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** Okay, Kiers, what are you doing?

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:54]** Kiers wants to find out if he recalls who this is.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:57]** Okay, give me wisdom check.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:59]** Okay.

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** All right.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:02]** It's a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** You have no idea who that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** Fake news.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:13]** So she said to Kiers, you killed my family.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Kev.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:18]** And in the name of Godwin Dawnstar, I'll get revenge on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** Godwina Longstar.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:21]** Although Dawnstar is kind of better.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** I kind of want to retcon that.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** Sounds really cool.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** Yeah, Dawnstar is better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:29]** In the name of Godwina Dawnstar, I will kill you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** All right.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:38]** Well, knowing that he doesn't know who she is or this accusation, he does think that, okay, this could have happened.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:40]** So he kind of, like, sighs to himself.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** And he's just like, ah.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:48]** And then he telepathically communicates to the team.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:52]** Hey guys, please keep her alive.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:53]** All right.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:56]** Try not to kill her.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** I got to ask some questions.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:05]** And then he's going to move up this way.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:09]** Diagonal move takes away.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:11]** It's like 10 feet, not 5.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:11]** It's 5 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:15]** It's 15 feet every two diagonals.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** So you moved one diagonal, so it's 5.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:18]** If you were to move diagonal again, that would be 15.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:20]** Okay, so that's 5, 10, 15.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:26]** You can move at most two diagonals usually.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:26]** How far can I get?

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** I can get to here maybe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:30]** From here, right?

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:37]** You went this way 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:41]** You could probably get here.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:48]** Here's the... So you get right in front of that crate, right around the corner from Godwina Dawnstar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:49]** Yeah.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:56]** Yeah, you know, I would really love to non-lethally damage her, but I'm kind of worried now that I will do that.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** You want a 50-50 hit?

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** No, I don't.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** You want a crazy hit?

**[00:57:59 - 00:57:59]** I don't.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:01]** So I'm going to try to use... Now's the time.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:01]** No.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** Now's the time.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** Do it.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** The Kelly special.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:05]** Hold on.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** The Kelly special.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:15]** So usually when you're rolling for non-lethal damage, it's not that you're... It's minus four to your attack roll, but if you hit...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:40]** still if you're hitting her like you don't the damage magnitude is still the same so right okay but it's not but you're guaranteed that if you hit you're not going to kill her right if if you hit with a non-lethal and it takes that that person's uh health to zero that's worse health i said person is that fair because it's not just for the dwarf it's for all peoples


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:41]** Is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:47]** Anyways, it takes the target to zero, then they do not fall dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:52]** My magic missile just became a bit of a liability for using it for these kinds of things.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** That was the point.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** It's a 50-50.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:58]** It's not even a minus.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:00]** We should have just done minus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:04]** I feel like that was a combination of Kev and Kelly both being like, this is a good idea.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** I can recall it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:08]** I think it's fair because otherwise we would just use magic missile.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:10]** We would just always use magic missile.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:10]** We would


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:14]** Otherwise, you'd hear somebody like Kielhauser say, I got shot in the head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:16]** Yes, with a magic missile.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** All right.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** That's good.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** Not being able to do that and not guaranteeing that I can't kill her.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:23]** I'm going to try to see what else I have.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:25]** I mean, ghost sound.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** That's probably not a good one.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** I have an invisible person.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** That's not going to help.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** Supercharged weapon.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:33]** All right.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:33]** I mean, I have a sword.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:36]** Can I attack her non-legally with a sword?


## Speaker_0

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:36]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:39]** Yeah, roll a minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:41]** Do you reach?

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** Nothing else works.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** Oh, yeah, you're right.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:44]** Can I throw my sword at him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** And you're around the corner.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:48]** So, yeah, I don't think you can throw your sword.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** You're not close enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:51]** And you'd have to use a move action to pull your sword.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:51]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** I can't even attack her.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:56]** All right, just guys, please remember that I asked to non-lethally attack her.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:58]** All right.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:02]** Here's is going to use this turn to shout to her and be like, who are you?

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** What did I do to you?

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** I don't remember this.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** So you don't.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** So you don't.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** Oh, actually, no, I'm sorry.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** Take one.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** I'm going to I'm going to daze her.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** That's what I'm going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:12]** You're going to daze her.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** Yeah.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** What's the spell?

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** All right.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** It's called DC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** It's a spell.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** DC is 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** 15.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:21]** Spell DC.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** What kind of save is it?

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:22]** Fort?

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:23]** Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** Is it a Will save?

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** It's got to be a Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** We need a Will save drop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:29]** It is a Will negates, which I guess is a Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** So that's Will save, yeah.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:34]** And we need that drop, and we need Nick being like, Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:38]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** Or like Steve Perry.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** Yeah.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:42]** Oh, man.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:43]** I'm really sorry, dude.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** She got a 23 on that.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** Good God.

**[01:00:46 - 01:01:11]** her she's a hefty girl not the physical fire but her right to take you out here she's not gonna be distracted she shakes it off was that your turn i don't think i could do anything else can i all right nico i believe the dc is 11 to put out the fire that's correct all right but you do that on your turn

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:16]** It says at the end of each round, you are burning.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** So this is the end of round one.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:21]** So that's why.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:24]** So I took the damage on my turn, right?

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:26]** And then at the start of my turn, I took it.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:27]** At the end of the round, I can roll to remove it.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:29]** DC 11.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:30]** Come on, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]** Oh, I got it.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]** 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:36]** So that means that I'll be burning for the next round.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** Wow.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:40]** It is the top of round two.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** Nico, it's your turn.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:45]** Nico's going to yell back over at Hears.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:48]** You want us to not kill this guy or this girl?

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:55]** Bearded questions making me confused.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:57]** You want us to not kill this person?

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** They called for reinforcements.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** We might not have that time.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:02]** Nico's going to take a forward roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:07]** And he's going to do a trick attack.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:10]** And he's going to try to do it non-lethally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** Oh, good man.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:11]** Okay.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:17]** So if you want to do a forward roll, I'm going to say you need to make an acrobatics check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:17]** Okay.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** I'll do an acrobatics check.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** You could just walk.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:22]** I mean, it was just for flavor, John.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** It was just for flavor.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:24]** Nope.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:25]** You did it.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:25]** You roll.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:26]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** Roll for your roll.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:31]** If you want to roll for that, I'm going to look to see if that's probably just your move action.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:33]** So I'll say give me a roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:38]** That's a 16 plus my acrobatics, which was... Man, y'all are rolling high today.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** You do it perfectly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:44]** Okay, I feel like Rick is standing there and just sees Nico roll.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:45]** It's like, what is going on?

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** Why did Nico roll?

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:49]** But you're like, but that was a good roll.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** Like, I don't know.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:50]** It was good.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:53]** All right, so trick attack against Bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:54]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:56]** Let me pull it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:59]** Well, I got a raw bluff check, so that's plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:01]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:02]** Plus eight for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:08]** And it's a bluff against the DC.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:10]** Okay, got it.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:13]** How does...

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:14]** Give it to me.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** A 23 do.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:18]** Ooh, you just made it.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:19]** Nicely done.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:20]** What do you do as a trick attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:25]** So, Nick, part of his role was the trick attack.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Okay.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:32]** So he's going to roll right into a trick attack where he just rolls and shoots with his offhand.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:35]** And he's going to be shooting one of the she dwarf's knees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:36]** Okay.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:36]** Okay.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** One of her knees.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:40]** One of her knees.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** That's how people sometimes say it.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:44]** Okay.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** I'm just messing with you.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:48]** I'm just messing with you.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:49]** All right.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:51]** Give me a shot.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:51]** All right.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** So she's flat-footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:53]** All right.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:54]** So flat-footed.

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** Flat-footed.

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:00]** That's a 14 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:03]** Against KAC?

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:04]** EAC.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:05]** EAC.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:06]** Yeah, that's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** Okay, cool.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:08]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:08]** Nice.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** Nice.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** What's your damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** That's a four on the first roll.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** Uh-huh.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** And the trick attack roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:20]** It's two.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:23]** You roll, line up.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:27]** and fire, and she falls dead.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:31]** Wait, dead?

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:34]** I just realized that you wanted to do it non-lethally.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:36]** Yeah, that's why I shot at her kneecap.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:37]** But here's the question.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:41]** Was the 11 with the minus 4 for non-lethal?

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:49]** Because you have to subtract 4 from the attack roll in order to do non-lethal damage with a lethal weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:52]** So that would have been a seven.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:54]** No, that was 11.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:57]** I rolled a natural 14.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:59]** It was an 11 with the minus four.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:02]** Or no, it'd be a 10 with the minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:04]** Okay.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:06]** Against EAC.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** Correct.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** Okay.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** And she was flat-footed.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:11]** Yep.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:16]** And I checked it, and I saw that because of that, you still would have hit.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:20]** So she falls to the ground, knee down, unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:22]** I think that is smart.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:23]** Yeah.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:24]** Are we out of combat now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:25]** No.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:27]** Hopefully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:27]** Here's the question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:29]** Until they come.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:31]** Here is the question.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:33]** She falls to the ground.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:36]** I'm going to put a little marking on her that says maybe, like, sleepy.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:37]** She's unconscious.

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:43]** So if you're in roll 20, you know that, like, droopy-eyed little symbol that you can see.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** It's kind of weird, but I kind of like it.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:50]** And it is now Dr.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:50]** O.K.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:50]** 's turn.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:52]** What are you doing, Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:54]** O.K.?

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:54]** Uh...

**[01:05:56 - 01:06:05]** I suppose I don't sense that I'm out of danger because I heard... Because the GM didn't say we're out of combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:05]** That's not true.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:08]** It's because you did hear her ask for reinforcements.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:09]** For reinforcements.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:13]** So I'm going to do my best.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:18]** I can double move on a full turn, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:21]** Yes, you can use your standard action as a move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:25]** Or if you wanted to, you could do a run, which actually lets you go three times faster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:27]** Yeah, run is a lot.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:28]** I'm going to run.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:29]** You're going to run?

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:30]** It's not called run.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:31]** Hold on.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:32]** I'm going to run to the door.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** Okay.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:35]** You're going to run.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:35]** Where's run?

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** Yeah, run.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** Full action.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:40]** Four times your speed in a straight line.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:40]** Oh.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:41]** Yeah.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:43]** And you're flat footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:45]** And there can't be anything in the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:47]** Where is that under?

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:49]** Because it's not under the move actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:50]** It is under.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:52]** It's under full actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:53]** That are full actions.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:56]** You're using your full action as that.

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:57]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:57 - 01:07:01]** But I can only go one spurt in one direction?

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:01]** Yes.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:03]** If you're using a straight line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:05]** You have a standard action and a move action.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:11]** So you can do a move and then use your standard action as a move and do twice your speed in whatever direction you move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:13]** Or you could just say screw it and commit yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:15]** And use the full action to run.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:19]** I'm going to go with the first option, which is to double.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:20]** Door number one.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:23]** Because I want to be able to...

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** Move up here.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:27]** Roll, look.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:29]** Can I roll a perception?

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:30]** Can I look out the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:32]** You want to open the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:34]** Yeah, just and look.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:35]** See if, like, I see.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:37]** Because I could...

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:38]** Correct me if I'm wrong.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:42]** Through the hallway, there was like a viewing area, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:43]** You could see down the hallway.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:46]** The problem is that to open the door, that would be another move action.

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:47]** Got it.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:47]** Yeah.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:49]** Isn't there windows on it, I thought?

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:51]** Oh, you can see outside.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:52]** I'll say that.

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:57]** Like most of these doors, except for the one in the secret thing, you can't see out that.

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:58]** But there's a little window.

**[01:07:58 - 01:07:59]** We talked about that before.

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:01]** So, yeah, you can see out.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:03]** You can pretty much just see in front of you.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:06]** And I'll just tell you that you don't see anything.

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:06]** Okay.

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:07]** Yeah.

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:09]** I guess that's my movement.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:11]** That is your movement.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:13]** All righty.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:16]** Godwina Dawnstar falls to the ground unconscious.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:19]** Gunhand clatters.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:24]** And... Nico and Rick...

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:29]** And possibly here is probably just Nico and Rick.

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:40]** You all hear the familiar sound of feet running down the hallway to your right outside the door.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:46]** And it is right at that moment that...

**[01:08:46 - 01:09:07]** this massive vesk comes into view from right behind and standing in front of the partial cover there at the bottom, looks over, sees you, and sees the unconscious God Weena, and then just shouts, FOR BASMARA WE FIGHT!

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:10]** And that is our game.

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:11]** You knew it was coming.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:13]** You knew that that was where we were going to end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:14]** Oh, great.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:15]** Other pirates.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:16]** Oh, my.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:21]** Hey, guys.

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:23]** Nico Ryan here.

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:28]** And I want to go ahead and have a conversation about assets and liabilities.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:47]** I found this book, pre-GAF, it's called the Oxford Dictionary, and it says that an asset is a useful or valuable thing, person, or quality, while a liability is a person or thing whose presence or behavior is likely to cause embarrassment or put one at a disadvantage.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:51]** That starfisher was going to knife us first chance they got.

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:56]** So, Rick19, you murder bot, you old so-and-so, I'm calling you out.

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:58]** This was self-defense.

**[01:09:59 - 01:10:02]** Nico Orion, signing off.


## Speaker_0

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:42]** Thank you.
