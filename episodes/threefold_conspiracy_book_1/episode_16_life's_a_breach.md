## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Last time on We'll Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:11]** Our group quickly found itself in the midst of a hostile takeover by the goblin mercenary group, the New Bloods.

**[00:00:11 - 00:00:21]** While Rick-19 attempts to normalize relations with the goblins, the New Bloods reveal that their leader, Gingeroga, is taking the bridge.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:26]** After a brief firefight, the group takes one of the goblins hostage.

**[00:00:27 - 00:00:33]** The goblin reveals to the group that one of his compatriots had a map of the ship on a pillowcase.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:42]** After relieving the dead space goblin of their map and Nico relieving the captured space goblin of his life, the group heads to the bridge to confront Gingeroga.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:44]** Will they make it in time?

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:48]** Find out this time on We'll Say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:40 - 00:02:00]** So in life, there are very few moments that are tough to describe when you feel like all the hard work that you've done culminates in one shining moment where it all comes out and you feel like you are Herculean.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:06]** But in RPGs, we just call it leveling up.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:08]** You all leveled up?

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:10]** You're level two now.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** You went from the first level.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:15]** How does it feel?

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** So excited.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** Level two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** No one for the Pokemon reference?

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:24]** I didn't hear the Pokemon reference.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:24]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** It was the level up Pokemon sound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:31]** Oh, we should just get that as a cue and we can use it.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:31]** It'll be good.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:33]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** That's such a beautiful sound.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Anthem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:39]** I want to be the very best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:40]** So good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:43]** Like no one ever was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** Do we heal all the way when we level up?

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** I'm trying to remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Do you heal all the way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** Here's the thing.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:53]** We should all be already healed, though, because we rested.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** You didn't rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** We did rest.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** You did a 10-minute rest.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** You did, right?

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** So here's the thing.

**[00:02:59 - 00:02:59]** Here's the thing.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:03]** We won't always level up, like, right before combat, right?

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:06]** That's not necessarily how it will, that's how it happened this time, but it won't always be the case.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:14]** So typically, if you did, then we probably level up, like, during a rest, so it just makes sense that you gain everything.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:17]** But since we did right before combat, right, then...

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:22]** If you had any injuries before, you're going to keep that same deficit.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:25]** You just add in the hit points and stamina points that you had before.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:29]** So you'll still be at a deficit compared to somebody who didn't take any damage.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:30]** Does that make sense?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:31]** Makes sense to me.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:44]** So you're saying, like, if you had 18 out of 20, and then you got an extra plus 5, that puts you at 25, but you had a minus 2 before, and so you're at 23 out of 25 instead of 18 out of 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Yes.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:45]** Yes.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:46]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:49]** And you can do that math however you want.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:49]** You can do it.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** What is it called?

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:51]** Core?

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** I can't even remember that.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** I can't even make fun of it anymore.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** What?

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:56]** Common core.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:59]** Is that what it's called?

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** Common core curriculum?

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:07]** Yeah, like where you're like, oh, you round to the nearest 10 and then you subtract and then you plus seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:07]** Okay.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:09]** Yeah, that was after our time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:10]** Always plus seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** I just know that parents are angry.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** That's all I know.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** Yeah, there are some angry parents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** Because it doesn't make sense to the people who actually learn math.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:22]** We're getting away from, we are discouraging students from leveling up.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** Let's not do that.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:23]** Yeah.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** It's horrible.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** Yeah, come on.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** All right.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** So, but here's the question.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:29]** So there's a reason it happened the way it did.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** Right.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:35]** You can take a listen to last week's ep if you want to hear how that went.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:46]** But knowing now that you, like I said, your injuries will remain, but you'll just have an extra pool of hit points.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:52]** But does anybody want to say what new abilities or choices that you made if you want to share?

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:59]** Or do you want to just keep it a secret and surprise me and all the listeners?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** I'll share one.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** I'll just...

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** You'll share one.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** I'll keep the other surprise.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:03]** Go ahead, Kevin.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** I want to hear yours first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:09]** Oh, I was going to say, I'm a soldier, so I just got an extra feat, and it wasn't even that special of a feat.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:19]** So my stamina went up, and I got some extra skill points, but I didn't learn any new spells or anything cool like Kelly's about to tell us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:22]** Yeah, that's quite cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:29]** I'll just go before the cool stuff happens, because I don't want to interrupt Kelly.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:31]** I don't want to end on a downer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:33]** I don't want to end on a downer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** Okay.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:48]** Uh, so yeah, I took a level of biohacker again, mostly just skill bumps, uh, specifically like my medicine check is, is much better odds now for the saving DC.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:52]** Um, as well as some features, um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:52 - 00:06:02]** I also have a medicine now because I added in medicine, so I have a plus five to medicine, so I can at least assist in things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** That's awesome, actually.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:07]** Now, Kelly, go ahead with your cool, cool-ass shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Yeah, Nick, is yours really cool?

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:14]** Because this affects whether you go before or after, apparently, the coolest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** There's so much pressure now.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** There's so much pressure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** There's a lot of pressure.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:20]** Kelly, that's what happens when you're the coolest, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:24]** Yeah, dude, just wear the mantle well.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** Wear it in good health.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** No, it's okay.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:30]** Okay, well, I mean...

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** I learned a couple more.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:37]** By the way, I speak a lot of languages, but I just learned Goblin and Yusoki, and I can also telepathically communicate being a Shirin.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** I learned Shirin.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** No way.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** Oh, hell yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** I didn't need to learn a language.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** Where did this come from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:50]** We're just... Yeah, well, we are educated and... I am a scholar, if you...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:53]** Did you see all the download new languages?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** Also, that's true.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** I think you should be able to.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:59]** There's one... I'll talk about one of the spells that I got.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** It's a supercharged weapon.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:05]** And so I can target a weapon, and this can be someone else in our party.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:13]** And on the weapon's next attack, if it's successful, it deals an additional 4d6 damage on a single charge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** Yeah.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:15]** 4d6?

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:15]** That is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** That is insane.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** Game changing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** I don't even have enough dice for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:20]** I know.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:20]** It's crazy.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** I do.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:21]** It's fine.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** I'll roll it for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** You're going to get all ones.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:25]** That's impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** That's incredible.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** That's if it's a single target.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:32]** 2d6 if it's, like, attacking all the creatures in an area.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:32]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:34]** Is that a touch attack?

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:36]** Or, like, you have to be right there and reach out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** It is a touch attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:37]** Okay.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:39]** So I'm going to stay very close to yours.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:41]** So hang out near yours.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** Yeah.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** Just hang out near yours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:45]** Gather around.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:50]** If that's not cool and doesn't want to make you play Starfinder, I don't know what does.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** That's all I'll share, I guess.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** How about you, Nick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** That's all I'll share.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:57]** Kelly, just so you know, I'm getting out my D6s just for you.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** I've got a bunch of D6s, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:01]** So, yeah.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** You're covered in that department.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:03]** Hell yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:05]** Can you roll just random dice on?

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:06]** Oh, there it is.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** I found it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** On what?

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** Whichever program we need to thank.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** Hero Lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** Yes, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** Hero Lab.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:17]** Hero Lab for all your hero development needs.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** Thanks, Hero Lab.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:28]** Nick, you conspicuously... Unless you're a DM or GM, at which point you need to get one of the other ones.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:29]** But we can talk about it.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** So, Nick, question.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:34]** You conspicuously didn't say anything, per se.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:35]** I feel like.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:37]** You have two secrets.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** Yeah.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:38]** You have two secrets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** All right.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:39]** Here's the truth.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:45]** I took my – I multiclassed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** Oh!

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:50]** Do you want to say what you multiclassed in or is that your secret?

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** Secret.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** The truth is he multiclassed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:56]** The secret is – I think I mentioned in a previous episode.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** You might have.

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:00]** I think I pretty sure did.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:00]** Yeah.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** I multiclassed into operative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** Oh, okay.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:04]** I was going to make it a cool little challenge for listeners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:08]** My secret will be what my specialty is in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** If you have a thought, reach out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:15]** Could you briefly explain what operative is for people listening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:16]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:18]** Just like a brief overview.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:20]** Yeah, what does multiclassing mean, Nick?

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:28]** So, multi-classing is what happens when each role-playing character starts out as one thing.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** So, for me, I started out as an envoy.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:36]** Now, I could have taken envoy all the way up to, like, 21, or whatever the max level is.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:46]** Or oftentimes when characters find themselves either from a role playing standpoint or from a character optimization standpoint, wish they could do something more.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:50]** They multiclass into a class that allows them to do that.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:59]** So in this case, I decided to multiclass into an operative after starting out as an envoy.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:02]** To get some more combat-based skills.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:13]** In addition to my secret, which I won't divulge now, but will be revealed as the story progresses.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:16]** That's why you multiclass.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** I'm excited for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** Intriguing.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Very intriguing.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** Intriguing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** Did you say what an operative was?

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:25]** I'm still in the dark about what an operative is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** So an operative.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** Let's see here.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:31]** I'm going to get out my Starfinder core rule book.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** Thank you, Paizo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** Hey.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** Hey.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** We love Paizo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** Paizo.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:40]** Paizo.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** New theme song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** Yeah, that is their new theme song, John.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:45]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** I think it's ISO.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** Never mind.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** I'll save it.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:51]** You'll save it?

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** That's your secret, too.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:55]** The description of an operative.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** You are a shadow.

**[00:10:56 - 00:11:01]** You move swiftly, strike suddenly, and always have an escape plan.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:06]** You're a consummate professional, and you always get the job done.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:16]** Whether it's scouting enemy lines, hunting down criminals, stealing and smuggling items, or assassinating key figures.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:22]** As an operative, you're skilled in a wide variety of disciplines and specialties.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:27]** and use speed, mobility, and your quick wits rather than relying on heavy weapons.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:34]** You excel at the art of surprise, whether it's sniping targets from cover or striking while their backs are turned.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:40]** You may be righteous, but you have no problem fighting dirty.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:44]** Achieving your objective is all that matters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:51]** Coming this fall on NBC Operative.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:52]** One man.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:55]** One mission.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** I think that really suits Nico.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** For sure.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** Some multi-class levels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:10]** One multi-classing envoy operative brought to you by the makers of Starfinder comes this summer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:14]** And also brought to you by Hallmark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:16]** Paizo Presents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:18]** Paizo Presents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:24]** And there's a Christmas version of that movie, too, for you, Nick.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:25]** Nico and Ryan.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:25]** In a new romance.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** Nico adheres.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:31]** An envoy to your operative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:39]** What happens when one envoy has to go and convince the operative to give up their job?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:41]** Will they fall in love?

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:44]** What shenanigans will ensue?

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:47]** This winter.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:49]** This winter, finally.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** Nico O'Ryan stars.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** Stars in.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** As Nico O'Ryan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:55]** Stars as Nico O'Ryan.

**[00:12:55 - 00:13:02]** Would you guys like me to read your guys' classes and make them sound cool, too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:02]** Oh, God.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:06]** I'm just reminded of that intergalactic television from Rick and Morty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:07]** Yeah.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** Very much.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** Yeah, 100%.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** Yeah, 100%.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:10]** Absolutely.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** Absolutely.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:16]** Well, we'll just look forward to the holiday special of Opera.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:16]** I'm excited.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** It's going to be good.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** Very exciting.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** Very exciting.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** You know what I'm stoked for?

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:26]** I'm stoked for the fact that you all are going to need these level twos.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:27]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:32]** We're just going to steamroll over all the NPCs in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:43]** Last time you all handily, handily took out the goblins that are part of the new blood crew that were searching the ship.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:49]** Speaking of, all of you, who was it that grabbed this map from one of the goblins?

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** It was here's.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** It was here.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:55]** I don't know if you showed it to everybody while you were there.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** I feel like you didn't.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Yeah, I don't think so.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:08]** I'm going to put it in your journal because I don't think you guys have had time to look at it, but it is in your journal as of now, Mr. Hears.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Okay.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:09]** Okay.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:14]** And that was a map that was on a pillowcase, and we can talk about that in a bit.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:26]** You all hear over the intercom a scuffle on the bridge, and one of the goblins talks about how Jinchuroga will kill you all.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:31]** So you, with the help of your Yusoki pilot, Grath, come up.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:38]** And as you're about to enter into the bridge, and Grath swipes the card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** Jing!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:42]** you all level up.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:45]** And that's where we ended.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:50]** Because opening that door gave us the plus two experience we needed to hit that next level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:52]** Yeah, it was mostly opening the door.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:52]** Yeah.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** To put you over the edge.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:59]** Yeah, that's... We measure experience... Pushing that one button gave us that XP, man.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:04]** Experience comes in very discrete quantities in Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:11]** I do got to talk... This is a side story, but my dog... My wife and I were having a discussion about how good my dog is, and...

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:13]** I was saying he's a good dog, mostly good dog.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** And she's saying he's mostly bad dog.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:20]** So we decided to like put it on a point system and actually try to like quantify how good he is.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:25]** The only problem is there's no standard for the number of points that we're giving him.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:35]** So even John was, we like met, uh, we did a home call with John and Ariel and, uh, they gave him like 17 points or something just for looking cute.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** So that's my story.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:39]** That's, that reminds me of XP is just like, it's arbitrary.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:40]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:40 - 00:16:01]** ridiculous kevin are you trying to tell us that booty leveled up too no because he has negative he always gets negative points because he's a terrible are often uh you know feats and experience are often mismatched as far as like points and accomplishment is concerned in my experience even with video games


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** It's tough.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** Yeah, I mean, obviously I give XP.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:16]** There's obviously XP for combat, but of course there's a lot of XP for discovering things, finding things out, resolving situations without combat, using those skills.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** It's all considered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** Bending people to your will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:23]** Through the use of pharmacological drugs.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** Yes, that is a thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:27]** Or just cunning bluffs and such.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** Or just bluffs.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** Culture checks.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** Diplomacy.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** You name it.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:33]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:43]** For our listeners, there actually is a very systematic way of giving XP, so don't be afraid of playing the game or trying to even GM a game.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Yeah, if you want to GM a game.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:47]** You can also play like John and just throw XP at everybody.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** You get XP and you get XP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** What are you talking about?

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:54]** You all don't know my XP giving habits.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** You don't know how I dole them out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** You just level us up for opening a door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:00]** I didn't level you up for opening a door.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:03]** I just chose to reveal it then.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:12]** As I said before, and I'll say again, when you all do things, the world responds, and there's a reason why you leveled up as you did.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:16]** What that reason is, maybe we'll find out in another episode.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:19]** Are you all ready for door number two to open?

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** Yeah.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** Are you ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** What's behind door number two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** Let's do it.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** Open it.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** ASMR.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** Open the door.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:38]** Thank you for coming to Open ASMR.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:38]** Right now.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:38]** It's not opening.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:39]** Is it stuck?

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** It's jammed.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** It's jammed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** Excellent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** Way to cut the tension there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** Just kind of fight.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:52]** Here we go.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** I'm sorry.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** I'm very nervous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:02]** On the bridge to the left stands first mate Lozupa here.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** Hands in the air.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:07]** A pistol at her feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:11]** John, not to interrupt, but we can't see it on roll 20 yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:14]** You, how dare you interrupt me?

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** You're super right.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:17]** Now you can see it.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** Whoa!

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:20]** This place is cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:21]** What?

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:22]** Yeah.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** What is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:31]** So on the bridge to the left stands First May Loza Pahir, hands in the air, a pistol at her feet.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:40]** And amid the officer's stations and near the central captain's chair stands Captain Rameem.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:44]** His face terrified, facing the first mate.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:48]** And this is where it gets interesting.

**[00:18:49 - 00:19:02]** Because behind the captain stands a creature that seems to be part hobgoblin and part wolf that looks like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** It's a shapeshifter?

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:06]** Oh, my God.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** What is that thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:11]** Holding Captain Rameem by the neck.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:16]** And as the doors open, it speaks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:21]** I think we got to describe this thing to the listeners first.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:23]** Yeah, please do.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** How tall is this thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:33]** I would say, I'm going to say probably without looking at a number that's in a book, six feet tall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** Okay.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:40]** So it's a six foot tall, hairy wolf looking creature, but it also has like bat features.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:43]** Very large, veiny ears.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:45]** Yellow piercing eyes.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:46]** Yeah.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:52]** And then it's also got this like cybernetic shield on its shoulders and random parts.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:55]** It's like a techno werewolf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:55]** Yeah.

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:01]** It looks like he's got like a headset to probably like some automated augmented targeting systems.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:06]** Probably some sort of looks intense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:11]** It looks like man, bear, pig, half man, half bear, half pig.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:15]** Whatever you need to do to not be afraid, Nico.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Whatever you need to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:19]** I'm watching South Park as I hold two guns in my hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:21]** Super cereal about that.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** Super cereal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:24]** Soup or cereal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:26]** Thank you for explaining that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** It speaks.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** I'm more of a soup guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:33]** Funny, Captain Rameem is more of a cereal guy.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** There you go.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** Milk, then cereal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:37]** That's just wrong.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** So it speaks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:53]** I will tear you apart if you don't give me the bridge and give me control, because I don't care who you are.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:57]** I will swallow your soul.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:59 - 00:20:59]** Damn.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:07]** And Lozu, as soon as the doors open, Lozu's eyes look over, probably catch Nico, maybe Grath.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:10]** Whoever's not standing right there can see her, per se.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:11]** You hear...

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:16]** Let's talk about this, Jinchiroga.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:25]** But Jinchiroga's eyes follow Lozu's, and Jinchiroga turns to face you.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:34]** And she raises her free hands and points it at Nico and says, Uh-uh-uh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:38]** Don't you want to be the winner?

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:42]** To help take the winner's spoils?

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:48]** Or else I will tear his throat out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:51]** Nico is just going to respond back.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:53]** And I know I'm doing this without the...

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** Actually, Nico's not going to do that.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:00]** What Nico's going to do instead is he's going to say, good night, mate.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:05]** And you can just see his... You can hear his pistols charging up.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:08]** It's like, you're going to want to drop the guy right now.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:14]** Drop the captain and none of this funny business has to end.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** Your life doesn't have to end here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** I gave you a choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:23]** You've taken out a good portion of your goblin friends here and they were a pushover.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** So...

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** Your call right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:29]** They are weak.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** They are weak.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:33]** So are you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** Your call, buddy, right now.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** Drop the captain.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:38]** You are weak.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** They were weak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** You will die.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:44]** Does anyone else do anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** I'm rolling an intimidation check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** I don't think he's intimidated.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:48]** Dr.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:49]** O.K., your question.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** I'll allow it.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** He sees all of us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:58]** No, only the ones like... He at least sees Nico and pointed at Nico.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:04]** Grath, I will say, has definitely seen Lozu and is like peeking around.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Probably seen Grath.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:09]** I don't know if you all are peeking around, but you have heard all of this at least.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:12]** I'm just revealing it to you so that way you know.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** Sorry.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** Nico, continue.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:21]** So, Nico, you roll an intimidation check on the part Hobgoblin Wolf...

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** That's six feet tall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:33]** That's 17 on the dice plus... Plus... Plus eight.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:34]** Damn.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** So that's like what?

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:38]** 25.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** 25?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:44]** Is anyone else doing anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:49]** Can I roll perception on what I can see from my vantage point without revealing myself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** Yeah...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** Natural one.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:01]** You can't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:09]** Uh, here's wants to roll life science to kind of get an idea about perhaps any weaknesses in this monstrosity.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** Okay.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:11]** Okay.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** I'll just do it.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** It's, uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:18]** A picture he hears is like peeking around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:23]** What are you going to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** Gingeroga is talking to Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** Oh, what am I going to say to Gingeroga?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:34]** Yeah, Gingeroga asked you a question and you tried to intimidate and that was your response.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** Oh, so, all right.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** We killed your friends.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:40]** We killed your little bloods out there.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** They were a pushover.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:53]** Drop the captain now and kindly find the nearest escape pod and get out of this ship before my pistol fingers get a little twitchy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:55 - 00:25:06]** And you see her hand come up and just stroke captain from memes, like the bottom part of his face where it's covered.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:15]** While that's happening, here's, I'm assuming you kind of peek around the corner and look to see, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:18]** Okay.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** You got a 24, correct, Demundo?

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:20]** Yes.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:21]** Okay.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:23]** So there, you'll find out two things.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:26]** You'll find out what it is and you want to know any weaknesses.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:32]** So this is known as a barghest.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:35]** B-A-R-G-H-E-S-T.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:46]** You recognize them as these shape changers that can either that are typically in their normal form as these giant canine looking hungry creatures.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:51]** But they can also shapeshift into that of a goblinoid.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** There are no weaknesses.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:55]** What?

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:56]** No weaknesses?

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:57]** Oh, my God.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** That you can see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:59 - 00:25:59]** Six invincible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:03]** Or that you know about.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:08]** Everyone give me a sense motive check on Jin Chiroga.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:15]** Nico, I'm going to say since you've been talking, you get a plus two.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** Since you've been the one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** I get a plus two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** Yeah.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:20]** I get rolled a 25 sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** I rolled a 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** Impressive.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** Impressive, Dr. Okay.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** Rick?

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** 10.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** 10.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:27]** Okay.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** Not so great.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** 8.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** 8 from here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** Nico?

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** Nico gets an 18.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** 18.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:35]** Okay.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:39]** I rolled a 10, but because you gave me the plus 2 and the plus 6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:41]** No, that's good.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** That's good.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:44]** All right.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:50]** Dr. Okay, maybe...

**[00:26:51 - 00:27:01]** There was something in what you saw, the way that you saw Jin Chiroga reach up and caress Captain Rumi's face.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:12]** But you can just tell that Jin Chiroga has had enough of this banter.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:16]** I'm going to need everyone to roll for initiative.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** Already?

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:19]** Okay.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** Oh, shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** Because here's what's going to happen.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:31]** I really want to know Dr. O'Kays specifically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:32]** Interesting.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Mine's 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:38]** 14 for here's initiative.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:41]** I got 12, 12.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:42]** Okay.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:45]** What about Rick and Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:52]** So there's something I didn't bring up during our level up discussions, but whenever you get a new feet, you can also change an old feet.

**[00:27:53 - 00:28:03]** And after under learning about delays, moving your initiative order, I threw out my improved initiative and,

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:06]** And I traded that for weapons-focused stuff.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:08]** So my initiative's not as high.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** It's now a 15.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** 11 plus 4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:12]** Okay.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:15]** Just so you know, I'll have to check.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** It might only be a soldier thing that you can switch out feats.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:18]** It's not for everybody.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** Because soldier has a specific thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** I don't care what the rule was.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:23]** It was in the soldier section.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** So I did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:27]** So, yeah, because you're a soldier.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:28]** Okay.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** Nico, what did you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:34]** I rolled a natural one, but I have a plus three, so that gives me four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:36]** Four.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** Okay.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:41]** Interesting, interesting, interesting.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:43]** Dr.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:54]** O.K., because you noticed this, this sense motive, there's a surprise round in which Jin Chiroga and you get to act because you were the only person to notice.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:59]** And Jin Chiroga goes before you.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:10]** So you all see, probably Dr. Okay, Nico, Hears, Rick, you might not, but you all see as Jin Chiroga.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:29]** He takes her hand and just clenches her hand into Captain Rameem's shoulders, her fierce talon-like nails piercing all of the ligaments and muscles in his left shoulder, and then goes and takes a bite out of his neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** He's going to turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:35]** And you just see this Kasathan blood start to come down.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:44]** And Captain Rameem starts to slump and fall, and Jinchiroga lets him fall to the ground.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** It is your turn, Dr. Okay.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:46]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:47 - 00:30:02]** Is it possible to do, like, a life science check on Captain Rameem and see, like, what his... Like, could I see if he's, like, suffering any conditions as a result of that bite, like, from how he reacts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:02]** I'll say this.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:08]** I think you need to be closer and you would need to make a medicine check if you want to do that because you're still a little far away.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:10]** Well, I know exactly what I'm going to do.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:17]** So I'm actually going to non-lethally shoot Captain Rameen.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:20]** Non-lethally shoot Captain Rameem.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:22]** With a pharmacological booster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:22]** Okay.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** All right.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:26]** So you're shooting Captain Rameem, who is bleeding.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** Stuff's hitting the fan right now.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** What are you shooting him with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:40]** I'm hitting him with a pharmacological booster to deliver a coagulant to a living creature, granting him immunity to the bleed condition.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:43]** for the duration of this effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:56]** Issue though, and I'm not trying to spoil it for you, but according to the map, you are standing behind me and a wall, so you don't have a clear line of sight to Captain Ramin.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:59]** Is that going to be a cover issue?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:06]** I would probably give Captain Rameem a bit of cover, unfortunately, because you're around the corner and Captain Rameem is not directly in your line of sight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:10]** And I'm mostly asking this because I'm also behind cover and I don't know how this works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** No, I definitely agree.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:16]** So I can only, in this round, can I only shoot or can I move and shoot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:20]** You can only do one or the other because it's a surprise round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** You can either move or shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:22]** Okay.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:28]** And this is, we still have the regular round after this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Yeah, so this is just a surprise round.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:37]** This is just like stuff happened because Jincho Rogan got tired of waiting, of presenting you with an opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** I'm going to go for it, I think.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:46]** I feel like that's my duties to the guy first, the captain.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** Okay.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:47]** All right.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:50]** Captain Rameem has a bit of soft cover, unfortunately.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:52]** I'm going to shoot him.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** Yeah, with cover.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:53]** Okay.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:54]** You're going to shoot.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** You're going to shoot.

**[00:31:55 - 00:32:01]** I get plus three on my range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:01]** 17.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** 17.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:06]** Let's see if that beats that soft cover.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:09]** Against KAC, correct?

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** I would, yeah, kinetic.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:13]** Yeah, because it's, yeah, kinetic.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** Yeah, that hits.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** Impressive.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:17]** Impressive.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** Okay, remind me again what this does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:24]** So the pharmacological booster, it's in the character operations manual.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:31]** You deliver a coagulant to a living creature, granting it immunity to the bleeding condition for the duration of this effect.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** I have to look up the duration.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** Okay.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** I think it's related to my level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:36 - 00:33:01]** but i'll double check right now okay so basically you want to stop so you get immunity right to the bleeding condition got it okay all right immunity to the bleeding condition okay i'll say this you know as a scientist that this doesn't necessarily mean that doctor or that captain rameem is stable but is immune you can't bleed out further next round possibly

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** Right.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:06]** That doesn't mean that they're stable, but it does mean that they won't bleed out, per se.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:06]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** That was my best shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** I don't know.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:09]** Okay.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** That was a good shot.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:10]** That was awesome.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:11]** Yeah.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Let me know on the duration.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:17]** I think we're going to move into round one.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** You know who's turning this first?

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** Lozu.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:29]** Niko hears, and probably Graf, they see Lozu almost, like, dive and grab the gun.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:32]** It's probably a laser pistol.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:36]** And then take a shot at Jin Chiroga.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:54]** And as she takes a shot, she shouts out, saying, I'll distract him, jumps, and then kind of tries to slide and shoot through underneath the computer terminals that are there.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:58]** And that is going to be a miss.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** It is.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** Oh, man, I'm excited.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:03]** I've been waiting on this.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:07]** It is Jyn Joroga's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** John, before you take your turn.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:11]** Yeah, what's up?

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:18]** I'm reminded of the song, My Girona, but instead of My Girona, it's Jyn Joroga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** Jyn Joroga.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:23]** Oh, hey, correction, by the way.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:26]** We need that as a drop.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:32]** So Lozu was trying to do harrying fire and actually did meet the AC for harrying fire.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:38]** So the next person to shoot Jinchuroga will get a plus two to their attack roll.

**[00:34:38 - 00:35:08]** whoever that may be so please keep that in mind so Jin Chiroga lets Captain Ramin slump to the ground turns looks at clearly at Lozu and then also at Nico and this is something else because Jin Chiroga almost takes both clawed hands and points at both of you and you hear like

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:20]** As both of you, me and Nico, will need to make a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:22]** Will save!

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:25]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:29]** Will save!


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:32]** Yeah.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:32]** Okay, let's do this.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** All right.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Woo-hoo.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** I got an 18.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** 18 for Nico.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:41]** That is a 20 for Lozu.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** Yeah.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:55]** So both of you pass, but you did miss out on like what would have been a horrible fate if the fear spell was successful.

**[00:35:55 - 00:36:02]** But since you passed the will save, you are shaken for one round.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:05]** Does anybody want to read off what shaken does?

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:08]** I think you can mark that on your hero lab, Nick.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:09]** Okay.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:10]** I'll read it off.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** Shaken.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:21]** You take a minus two penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks while you have the shaking condition.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:25]** So you get a minus two to your attack rolls and a lot of other stuff here, Nico.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** So does Lozu.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:43]** Because just the visage of this horrible canine beast standing there on the bridge having ripped open Captain Rameem, it seems like, is almost terrifying as you feel these fears start to well up inside you.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:51]** And through sheer force of will, both of you are able to push them down.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:57]** At that point, Jin Chiroga is going to stay right where she is.

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:03]** Rick19, what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:08]** So first I had a question about movement because I don't think I've ever moved diagonally in this game yet.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** Oh, it's just five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:13]** And then I think two diagonals is 15 feet.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:13]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:15]** So every two diagonals, isn't it?

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** Yep.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** Okay, cool.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** Then that's going to help me.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:30]** Because one thing I noticed when I was doing my level up is that when Kelly slash Hears threw me the ice carbine.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:32]** That happened.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** That did happen.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** And I caught it successfully.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:37]** Yep.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** However, that encumbered me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** Oh, wow.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Wow.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** What does encumbered mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** I don't know the book's definition.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** I'd have to find it.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:54]** But basically it means I'm holding too much mass and that I'm not strong enough to carry everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:56]** All of your speeds are reduced by 10 feet.

**[00:37:56 - 00:38:02]** Your maximum dex bonus to your armor class is reduced to plus 2, and you take a minus 5 penalty to strength and dex base checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** Yeah, so about that.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** And it comes down to bulk.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:08]** The way that Starfinder works is they use bulk.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:11]** And so I have a maximum of 12 bulk.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:15]** However, half of your bulk, if you have more than half your bulk, you are encumbered.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** And so I have 7 out of 12.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** That's over half.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** I am encumbered.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:26]** So what that does, the biggest thing is right now it reduces my movement speed from 30 down to 20.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:32]** But from positioning, I think I can go 5, 10.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:35]** And then this would be 20 to get to there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:35]** 20.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** Yeah.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:36]** Okay, cool.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** Yeah, I did it right.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:38]** Woo.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:38]** Okay.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:42]** So, and Rick, Rick does this pretty quickly.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:47]** He just, he, he's got cover from the outside of the wall and then he's just going to slip around that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** He's going to move to cover.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** Is he crouching?

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:51]** So he runs into the left.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:54]** Is he crouching behind this panel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:56]** Can I crouch separately?

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** How does crouching work with movement?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:02]** I think going from standing to prone or prone to standing is part of a move action thing.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:06]** But if you're just going to go take cover, I'll allow you to do that.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:07]** Okay, then yes.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** I'm going to crouch down behind this.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** Am I just taking cover?

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** No, I was going to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:15]** No, but you are going to take cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:15]** Yes.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** Got it.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:21]** He does that crawl walk that cops do when they go into rooms for soldiers.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:21]** Got it.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** Because he's a soldier.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** Yep.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:28]** He ducks in, shuffle steps over there, gets behind them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:32]** Lozu is on the ground next to you, pointing her gun, but kind of shaking.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** You can see her gun trembling.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:34]** And you shoot at Jinchiroga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:39]** Rick has zero trust in Lozu, so he's going to first roll perception on her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** Okay.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:43]** Uh, 16 plus five is a 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:49]** She seems genuinely, like, concerned, shaken.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:51]** This is a big test for her.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:55]** She is, like, very concerned for Captain Armine.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** You can see fear in her eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:56 - 00:40:01]** Would I also have to do, like, a sense motive to see if she's lying about any of that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:06]** That's a different check, and I would say if you want to do that, that's going to eat into your stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:10]** My sense mode is pretty weak to begin with, so I'm not going to do that.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:14]** Rick is going to look at her and say, I tried to warn you.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:19]** And then he's going to lift up his carbine and target Lozu.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** You're going to target Lozu?

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** I tried to warn you that I will destroy you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:29]** He's going to shoot at Jinjiroga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:51]** ginger roga you get a plus two from her harrying fire all right so yeah if that doesn't convince you i don't know what does and what'd you get i have a plus seven on this because of all my feats that i took yeah so i rolled i guess eac or casey

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** Oh, it sounds like it was a critical.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:55]** Sounds like it was a critical hit, right?

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** It was a one.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** I rolled a one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:00]** No way!

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** Rick.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** We doing a critical fumble?

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:05]** We doing a critical fumble from Paisa's critical fumble deck?

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** Of course.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** I think we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:07]** Of course.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Reluctantly.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:11]** I can't believe that happened.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:11]** Damn it.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** You even had a plus two.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** Critical.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** I had a plus nine for this hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Critical Fumble.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:20]** Critical Fumble.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:22]** I rolled a 10, technically.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:25]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:25]** Here we go.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** Critical Fumble.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:28]** All right.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:31]** I'm going to flip the cards in front of the camera, and then you tell me when to stop.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:31]** Ready?

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** Three, two, one.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** Stop.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:35]** Okay.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:41]** This is... Oh, man!

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:42]** No!

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** No, is it good?

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** Oh, wow.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** It sounds good.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** Yeah, it sounds awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** This is an energy weapon?

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:49]** It is... Is it an energy weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** I don't know.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:53]** It's the cryo.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Yeah, it's the cryo.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** Yeah, so that's energy.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** Okay.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:57]** Yeah, 90% sure.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:07]** You deal half weapon damage to your nearest ally if the attack could normally target that ally and are staggered for one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:16]** Lozu tries to give you harrying fire, tries to help you out, and yet you still are rude.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:19]** Okay, so you do half weapon damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** He doesn't target her, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:29]** For those of you at home, Nick is the only one, or Rick is the only one in the bridge room and is next to an NPC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** Yeah, convenient.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** And conveniently, yeah.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** So you're definitely going to hit Lozu.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Roll your weapon damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:42]** So Rick lifts up his ice carbine, and he aims at a gingeroga, and he pulls that trigger, but it just jams.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:47]** And so he ducks it down, and he starts hitting it to try to unjam it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** Flex Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:50]** And it blasts off to the side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** Oh, my God.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** Oh, wow.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** And you hit Lozu.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** How much damage?

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** So I roll a regular damage.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** Yeah, regular damage.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** And you're staggered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:03]** Okay, I'm adding my staggered now, so give me a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:11]** Staggered, for everyone listening, is you can take a single move action or a standard action each round, but not both, nor can you take full actions.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** You can take swift actions, but not reactions.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:15]** So next round, you will be staggered.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** Lozu is shaken.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** Nico is shaken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** Okay, and then... How much damage was that?

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:24]** That is a D8 of damage.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** Uh-huh.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:28]** So I'm going to roll D8, and it's a critical five.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** It's a five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:32]** So round down, so two points of damage.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:36]** Half that, round down, two points of damage.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:41]** As this ice carbine just hits her in the back, and you hear, ah!

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** As she, like, screams.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** That sounded kind of like a goblin scream.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:47]** And Rick just goes, my apologies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** That's good.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** So rude.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** That's empathy plug-in.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:55]** So rude.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:59]** My empathy plug-in needs, I need to connect to the internet.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** What is your Wi-Fi?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:05]** Human complexities are beyond the scope of my programming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** Here's, it's your turn.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** What are you doing on your turn?

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:12]** We're not off to a good start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:20]** Here's is going to make a beeline right for Rick and then kind of skid like right behind him, behind this, uh,

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:24]** I guess, terminal that he and Lozu are hiding behind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** So the three of you behind this terminal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:27]** Using cover.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** Using cover.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:28]** Smart.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:29]** Smart.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:34]** Here's kind of looks at Rick and puts his one hand on his shoulder and then another hand on his gun.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:37]** He's like, try not to screw up next time.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:54]** and this like blue energy comes out of his hand onto the gun oh my god oh that's what i'm talking about because he has cast supercharged weapon no way oh my god this is so good


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** I hope I don't let you down, man.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** I hope I don't let you down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** Oh, man.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** We'll see.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:02]** All right.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** So you cast supercharge.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:05]** That is one action.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:07]** And what happens again?

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:10]** It's an extra 46 on the next shot.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:10]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:12]** If it's successful.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:13]** Yeah.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Successful.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:14]** Yeah.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** If it's a single target, which it is.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** So that's it.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Okay.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** Yeah.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:22]** Well, good news is I have plus nine to hit, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** No, the harrying fire only lasts for the next person.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:29]** Unless she does harrying fire again.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** Will she, though, now that you've shot her in the back?

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** She might shoot me instead.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** Yeah, she's just going to blow your head off.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** Good move, Hears.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:38]** Nice support plan.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:38]** Is that your turn?

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:42]** That is my turn.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:42]** And you moved.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:48]** Dr. Rokey, what are you doing?

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:48]** Yes.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:50]** So I think...

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:56]** Can I like use this outside area as cover?

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** Like around this corner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:01]** If you are standing behind there, I'm going to be honest, that's going to be a lot of cover.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:06]** Like she's not necessarily going to be able to target you, right?

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:06]** Okay.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** Yeah.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** So I'm just going to fire.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:19]** I mean, I would honestly say that you're going to have like probably improved cover because there is one corner of her square can touch one corner of that square through the open door.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:23]** But you'll have an immense amount of cover.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:23]** All right.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** So you're going to shoot.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:26]** Roll to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:30]** 16 against what?

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** EAC?

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:31]** KAC?

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:32]** KAC.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:37]** That's a miss as it hits part of her armor.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:41]** And those blue things that you saw, those are a specific type of armor.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:44]** Those blue holographic type of armor.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:46]** It hits an area in between it.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:48]** It just dissipates it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** She's armored.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** This is tough.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** This is going to be tough.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:56]** She's armored to at least 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:02]** Dude, if I had to pick a number out of 20, it's at least 16.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:03]** At least 16.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:04]** At least.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** It is Grath.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:09]** Grath looks over at you, Dr. Roque.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** He's like, that's a good idea.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** That's a good idea.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:14]** And then just pulls out.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:27]** his azimuth laser pistol, and he is going to fire and peek around and fire at Jin Chiroga, not doing a harrying fire, just actually trying to shoot at Jin Chiroga.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Jin Chiroga!

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** What does the...

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:40]** That is a nine, which, with all things considered, does not meet the requisite EAC.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:42]** Thank you, Grath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** Super great.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** Thanks, Grath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:49]** I like how Grath and Dr. OK are both on each side of the door, then Nico just still standing in the middle.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** Funny I say that.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** Nico, it's your turn.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** You're shaken for a round.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** What are you going to do?

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** Go ahead, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:00]** I forget what the shaken condition does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:04]** minus two to skills, attack rolls, things like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:06]** So Niko is gonna like,

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:12]** Nico's basically reacting right now from a role-playing standpoint to everything that happened the previous six seconds.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:21]** He's going to react to him, to Jin Chiroga biting the crap out of the captain's neck.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:24]** And he's going to visibly pale when he sees that.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** He's going to visibly pale.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:28]** And he's going to be like, oh, that's not good.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:37]** And then not pulling up his second blaster because he doesn't really have the focus because it kind of shocked him.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:41]** He then hears the Frost Blaster kind of malfunction and shoot her in the back.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:47]** And he doesn't say anything aloud, but he thinks to himself, that's why you don't use weapons picked up off the ground.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:54]** Being a little weapon snob for a second in his head.

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:01]** And then he's going to do a trick attack.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:06]** He's going to do a trick attack, a little operative move here.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** You're going to start moving in the operative.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** Is this your secret?

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** This is your secret?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:12]** This is your secret.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** That's one secret.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** That's one secret.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** Yeah.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:21]** I like this idea because you probably get a little bit of a flashback of Santuko, too, seeing Captain Ramin go down.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** And so you're like, wow, I got to get creative here.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:27]** Can you do a trick attack?

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** So tell me about trick attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** Since I don't think we've had a trick attack.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:32]** No, we've never done a trick attack before.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** So trick attack.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:38]** So you can trick or startle a foe and then attack when she drops her guard.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:42]** As a full action, you can move up to your speed, whether or not you moved.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:49]** You can then make an attack with a melee weapon, with the operative special property, or with any small arm.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:54]** Just before making your attack, attempt a bluff, intimidate, or stealth check.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** Okay.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:59]** With the DC equal to 20 plus your target CR.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:06]** If you succeed at the check, you deal 1d4 additional damage and the target is flat footed.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:17]** This damage increases to 1d8 at third level, 3d8 at fifth level, and by any addition, 1d8 every two levels thereafter.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:20]** So you need to make a bluff or intimidate check, right?

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** Yes, that's correct.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** So what's the CR there?

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** What's the CR?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:30]** A CR for any aspiring GMs is called the challenge rating.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:35]** It's a way to quantify how difficult creatures are based on all of their various abilities.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:38]** And you compare that to the average party level.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** There are ways to kind of set that up.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** I'm not going to tell you what the CR is.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** You make your roll.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:45]** I'll tell you whether you meet the DC or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:49]** So peek behind the curtain with John Swan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:49 - 00:51:12]** little little jazz play out did uh you get an at 20 there no i didn't i did not i got a 17 though plus eight um plus eight wow wow 25 yeah i'm double checking that because it's a bluff yeah that's a bluff check that's plus eight for me

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:15]** Oh yeah, I totally peaked that.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** Dude, that is impressive.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** You want to know what?

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** You got that check.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** You beat the DC.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** What do you do as your bluff?

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** This is awesome.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:30]** With his pistols kind of going down a little bit as he's kind of visibly paling and saying, oh, that's not good.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:38]** He just kind of flips up his right hand, his other pistol hand, and he just kind of pulls the trigger and fires immediately.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:43]** Kind of like looking like he dropped his guard, but really he was just coming up to attack.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** Okay.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** So, nice.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** That's a natty 18 plus one.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** That's a 19.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** Whiskey Foxtrot Niner coming in.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:53]** Wow.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:55]** I hope that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** Wow.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:56]** Wow.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:58]** Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:58]** Wow.

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:58]** Woo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:59 - 00:51:59]** Okay.

**[00:51:59 - 00:51:59]** All right.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** So you shoot.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** Wow.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** Wow.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** Is this EAC or KAC?

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:06]** This is your azimuth laser pistol, right?

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:06]** So it's EAC?

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** Yes, it's EAC.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:08]** That's a hit.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** And they are now flat-footed, right?

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Jinchuroga is now flat-footed as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** Plus I get another D4.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:17]** So it's like I shot with one gun anyway.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** It's like I shot with two guns anyway and hit both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** That is awesome.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:23]** So how much damage are we looking at here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** Four on the first roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** And a two on the second.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:33]** So six points of damage to Jin Chiroga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** Flat foot is the most helpful part of that shot, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:39]** And then now flat footed, which means minus two to AC.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** For how long?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** Damage target is flat footed.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:47]** It doesn't say how long they're flat footed for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** Okay.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:52]** Maybe take a look at that while we are moving on.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:52]** That is awesome.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:55]** Are you moving at all, or are you just standing right there?

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:55]** He's standing right there.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** He's standing right there.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** All right.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:03]** Take a look to see how long Jinchuruga is flat-footed, and then let me know.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:06]** That is the end of round one.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:12]** It is the start of round two, and it is Lozu's turn.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** Lozu looks over.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:36]** at rick as soon as she's been hit and just what watch where you're shooting and like reaches around and touches her back and then tries to sit up and like lean back and hold herself and then take another shot at jinchiroga and as part of carrying fire let's see if it works

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** Yes, that is a 19.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:57]** So the next person to shoot Jin Chiroga gets a plus two from the harrying fire because Jin Chiroga was just hit, tricked by Nico, and then a shot goes by and you can see Jin Chiroga appear a little confused for a second trying to get her bearings.

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:59]** Oh, man.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:02]** And it is Jin Chiroga's turn.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:09]** What does one do when they're a Barcast taking the bridge of a starship?

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** Who do they attack?

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** The two or three people in the corner?

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:14]** Crowding?

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** Hiding behind?

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:25]** Or do they attack the singular person who from the beginning taunted and then shot and dealt damage?

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:29]** That would be Mr. Nico Orion.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** And you know what?

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** They're going to attack you, Nico, Ryan.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:55]** You see this six foot tall, like 250 pound creature just start lumbering right towards you, coming directly at you, coming out just like almost like a Wolverine just takes their claws, throws them and gets ready to attack.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** And they are going to roll.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:59]** And I'm not going to lie.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** This is going to hurt.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** Fuck.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:08]** And we will find out next time because that is our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:08]** Eko!

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:09]** Hang in there, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** Oh, man.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:12]** Eko.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** Your toast!

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:14]** Maybe.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:16]** Who knows?
