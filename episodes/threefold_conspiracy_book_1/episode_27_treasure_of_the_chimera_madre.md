**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Last time on Will Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:08]** Combat continued as our group tried to put down the pirate insurrection.

**[00:00:08 - 00:00:11]** Gears took a swing and knocked out the Astrozoan pirate.

**[00:00:12 - 00:00:16]** However, things got interesting when the group tried to decide what to do with their prisoners.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:21]** Most of the group seemed content to tie them up and leave them for further questioning.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:23]** Niko had a different solution.

**[00:00:24 - 00:00:30]** Niko proposed the rest of the group move ahead while he stayed behind and took care of the prisoners.

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:32]** This was immediately stopped by Rick-19.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:38]** Then the group plus Lozu moved along the corridor and entered the unexplored second cargo hold.

**[00:00:39 - 00:00:44]** When they entered, they discovered an open crate and a disheveled Algeata.

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:46]** Is the group headed for a showdown?

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:39]** Hello.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:42]** Hey.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** Nick, you just waved at me.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** I don't know what that means.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:45]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:48]** I had something I wanted to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** Dude.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** Guys.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** By all means.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** Please.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:54]** I wanted to start episode 27 with just a meditative moment.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:57]** So, besides the fact that that's now gone.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:58]** Go ahead.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** I feel guilty now.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** I'm just messing with you, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:03]** What did you want to say?

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** What did you want to say?

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:06]** I didn't have anything.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** Go.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:10]** I was going to make a joke about me being late on my clap.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** You were late again.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** Last week and this week.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** Wait, really?

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** Someone was late?

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** It seemed like it was perfect.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:25]** Seriously, I was on time, but I thought someone would hear it late, so I was going to say, hey, guys, I'm three weeks late.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** And you'd be like, what?

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Three weeks late in my class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:33]** This is the audio from last week's episode.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:38]** Nick's audio is from last week, and we're going to bump it week per week.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Wait, so who was late?

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:44]** Because I forgot to load up the sirenscape, so I was looking, but I heard somebody be late.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:44]** Who was it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** Someone fucked up.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:51]** Looked to me like it was Kelly, but I... Oh, you talk about recording.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:51]** The clap.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** No, not recording.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** Oh, the clap.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:53]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** Yeah, the clap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:58]** Maybe it's delay on my end then, because it seemed fine.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** I guess I need you now, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** This is why we never thank Zoom in our podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:05]** This is why Zoom is just never on the list.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** A lot of other people, not Zoom.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** Zoom's not in the link tree.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** We don't do it.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:16]** Well, I guess we'll never know the mystery inside the mystery.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** And that is who was late on episode 27.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** We're fairly certain that it's Kelly.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:23]** But is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:26]** But that breaks the convention because it's always Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** It's always Nick.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** It feels like we have another mystery in the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** Don't make it personal.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:36]** It's my internet connection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:39]** How much are you paying for, Nick?

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:41]** What's your internet connection?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:45]** Right now, I'm having technical difficulties because I can't access my 5G laptop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:48]** Quite honestly, though, it's really...

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:55]** No matter what you do, you're stuck at a certain speed because it's like a monopoly of where you live.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** You've one of two options.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** That's true.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** American internet is bad.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** Garbage.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** Yeah, it's bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:08]** Yeah, when we moved to Los Feliz, I called AT&T.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** I think I was with them.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:16]** And they were like, yeah, sorry, but like two miles around where you live, we don't service there.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** But everywhere else around there we do, but not there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** So good luck with Spectrum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** Sad but true.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Yeah, have fun with Spectrum.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** Cool.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:29]** Well, since this was probably one of our not as strong openers,

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** No, I thought it was charming and how weird it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** It was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** It was charming and weird.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** I thought my joke was funny.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:43]** I was trying to get John to let me do it and then let me open, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** Dude, Nick, you can always open if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:48]** Nobody wants to hear our jokes anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** Our listeners?

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** Yeah, all five listeners that we have.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:51]** It's fine.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:53]** Kev estimated it at five.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:58]** Maybe plus or minus five, so it might be a zero.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** Your dad, that's right, who made a Podbean profile just to listen to us.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** With a picture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:07]** Shout out to all of our good listeners, like my cousin Matt and my good friend Jacob.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:09]** They are loyal listeners.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Thank you for sticking with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** I'd like to thank the Brazilians.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** Brazilians.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** Yeah.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:19]** That's why we have flags in Brazil.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:20]** Kelly.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:23]** Hello, Brazilians.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:26]** Next week, Kelly's going to be like, that's a shorthand.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** The Willzilians.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:32]** They're going to hear this, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:34]** Kelly, next week.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:34]** Hey, guys.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** Thanks for listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:42]** Kelly, next week, he's going to be like, I'd like to give a shout-out to the Merovingian.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:44]** Thank you for being a loyal listener, please.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:46]** The Merovingians.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:49]** And only to the Merovingians.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:52]** Ultimate goal, though, is to get The Rock to listen to us while he works out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** That is the ultimate goal.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** That is the ultimate goal.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** That's it.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:56]** That would be great.

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:00]** I don't think we're intense enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:01]** First workouts?

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** Yeah, totally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** Yeah, totally.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** We have the confidence.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** We will be.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Let's be subjunctive.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** If you build it, they will come.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:17]** With Nick's 80s references and killer digs on vocals, who could say no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:20]** Who could resist?


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:20]** So, listeners...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** Just send that clip to The Rock.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** Just send that to The Rock and we'll be good.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:26]** And we'll be good.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** And just be like, just ask The Rock and tell him to listen.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:29]** It's fine.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:33]** And then have them timestamp it and send us a picture and we'll post it and it'll be great.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:35]** And we'll all be friends and it'll be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** I think Dougie will be friends with The Rock.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:37]** He's a cool dude.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** He is a cool dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:39 - 00:07:05]** question can we get aussies all aboard the crazy train like can we get aussies all aboard the crazy train like on cue because i think that'd be hilarious every time we get ready to go i don't have it nick i'm confused are you talking about aussies all aboard the crazy train aussie osborne's yeah crazy train when he says that's black sabbath isn't it yeah it is all aboard all aboard

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** That one?

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Yeah.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:11]** I think it'd be hilarious to do that before we start our podcasts.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:20]** And now, as we get ready to go to roll 20... All aboard!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:25]** I think we need to have some listeners submit what kind of samples they want us to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:30]** I'm friends with Merlin Olsen too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:35]** There's been a clip from Will and we're just talking over it.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** And we're just talking over this sample.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** We're talking over it.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:41]** Your dog is eating an avocado.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:48]** I don't think you played it last week, Will, so I think we're really short.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:48]** We're overdue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** We're going to need to play it.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:53]** The whole hour is going to just be... That needs to be your response.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:56]** I've been missing that one.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:58]** This is a strange...

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** This is a strange place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:04]** This is a strange place.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** That's what I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** You're not wrong.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:12]** And with that, let's go back to the Chimera.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:21]** Let's think about how long it took for you guys to decide what you wanted to do before going into the Port Cargo Bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:29]** For the record, I think I was the one that was the most indecisive because I was the most nervous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:43]** nah it's okay it was cool it's good that's that's that's the game we're all nervous we're all playing i like it that's your truth it's good i know my truth i'm so nervous on this one yep it's good


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:44 - 00:09:06]** So let me quickly recap from last week in that after a quick surprise attack from who you now know is the Astrazoan WEM, you quickly take them out, revive the real Lozu, and find out that possibly the intent of the pirates...

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:36]** was to find out the relic maybe they knew that before they came on board maybe they didn't reason might tell you that they didn't because when they came aboard the bridge then they decided to go or maybe they did who knows maybe you'll find out now because then you locked up the two prisoners Sabrina Godwina and now Wem the third prisoner in the gym then trepidatiously made your way down the hallway to the double doors of the port cargo bay

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** Nico runs in, as he does.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** Classic.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:51]** And discovers that a lot of the cargo here has been pulled out.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:58]** A lot of the cargo crates have their contents strewn out.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:02]** And those contents were mass-produced trinkets.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** Cheap trade goods.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** A little odd.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:10]** But there's one in particular that had been separated from the rest.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:24]** And you could tell as soon as you walked in, Nico, and anyone else that looked in as you all were standing in the hallway, that the door on the side, the computerized locks have been destroyed.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:27]** The latches were bent off the crate.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:31]** And one of the sides was flat on the floor.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:37]** And inside was a small silvery box sitting on a pedestal.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:46]** And the nearly flawless smooth metal titanium, let's call it, sides were nearly identical.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:53]** Except on one, there looked to be probably a biometric scanner.

**[00:10:53 - 00:11:00]** And right at that moment, a figure steps out from behind.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** Dun-dun-dun.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:02]** Dun-dun-dun.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** Bruised face.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:08]** Haggard look in her eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:12]** And it is the face of Algiada Eom.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:17]** And I move you to roll 20, where you can see the cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:24]** Nico, Algiatis takes a few steps forward out of the box.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:36]** Just so you all know, the box is in the center and then in the north, south, east and west corners of the room, there seem to be some more cargo where everything is pulled out.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:45]** The look into the big cargo bay, just for the players here, the roof has been removed so you can see the layout of it.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** So you're not seeing the roof.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:48]** You're looking down at the floor there.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:52]** And that thing in the center is where the pedestal, where the box is.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:55]** Nico, Algiata sees you.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:59]** And instantly her eyes look hopeful.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:03]** And you can just barely make out the words of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:21]** The captain locked me in this crate when I found out that he was working with a group of pirates to steal the relic the professor brought on board.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** But be careful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:25]** She looks around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** I think he's still around here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:35]** She staggers and then she takes another five foot step forward, but then falls to one knee and catches herself.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** What do you all do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:43]** Rick raises his rifle and starts to pace in towards her slowly with his rifle trained on her.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** Okay.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** There's artillery laser.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** Move your token.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:51]** And I want to roll perception on the room to see if there's anybody else around, any sign of anybody else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:54]** Give me a perception.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** Check.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** A what?

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:57]** 15.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:59]** 15.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** Okay.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** What is everyone else doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:07]** Nico wants to roll both a perception check on her and a sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** Okay.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** So give me one sec.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** So Rick, you rolled a perception check.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:16]** Nico, you're rolling a perception and sense motive.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:21]** Perception on the room and sense motive on her or just sense motive perception on her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:24]** Perception on her and sense motive on her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:24]** Give me your rolls.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** Dr. Okay, here's what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** So that's a 10 on my perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** Yep.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:42]** Could I do, like, a recall knowledge of, like, life science to see, like, what kind of effects she might be under?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** Sure.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** She might be an astrozoan.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Nico, what was your sense motive?

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:47]** 23.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:49]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:52]** Or, like, yeah, what she... Is she an identifier?

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:57]** I'm wondering if she's, like, actually the real Algiata...

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:06]** And that she was actually in the cargo because she actually knows Professor Benjamin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:12]** Except the AstraZoan's been on board for at least since the station.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:18]** And the captain would have been the real captain at the time that tried to lock her up.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:28]** Because the real Algiata wouldn't be going against the professor because she probably knows him in that picture.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:32]** So I personally think this is the fake Algiata.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:35]** Okay, well, I'm going to still do my life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** Life science on Algiata?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:48]** Well, I do have the... I took a sample from...

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:52]** The other astrozoan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:55]** Oh, and before I forget, sorry, I have bounty hunter...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** No, this is good.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** This is good.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** Use all of your character's abilities.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Think.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** This whole AP is about thinking.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** So I'm, yes, like, this is good.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** This is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:06]** Okay.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:12]** Here's his detect magic is still active, so I might as well see if that turns anything out.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:12]** That's right.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** I doubt it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** Also, dang it.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:19]** Here's, we didn't, you wanted to look at the Vesk note last episode.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** I did do that, yeah.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:21]** And we didn't.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** Could I do that quickly?


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:24]** We saw the note.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** It's the box, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:30]** Oh, you want to look at the zip stick that was in there.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** If I remember correctly.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:35]** I believe so.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** Yeah, there's a zip stick.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** You pulled out the package.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** There was a little package in there, right?

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:47]** You had read the note because it came from Trostnack's wife.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** Remember?

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:49]** Yeah.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** Because you could read Vesk.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** Yeah, we read the note.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:54]** It was just, I love you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:54 - 00:16:00]** Yeah, it was like, I love you, my mother knows that you might be messing around.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** And she's not so tolerant of that.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:06]** The gift wrap package, you quickly unwrap it.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** This is back earlier.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:16]** You found a zip stick, a gold-plated zip stick that is worth 100 credits.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** And I am going to...

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** Oh, that's all it was?

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** I have it in here.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:26]** I'm going to add it to all of your journals, and I'm going to show it to you.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** This is what it looks like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** It's just a cred stick, though?

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** Is that what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** It's like a zip stick.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** Here we go.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** It looks like this.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** What is a zip stick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** It looks like a proven tool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** What does it do?

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:36]** Like a cattle prod.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:40]** So it's blue and gold.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:43]** It has like a prong.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:48]** It's kind of like a two-pronged fork.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:51]** Yeah, like an alien kettle prop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** Yeah, I'd say that's about right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** It's a pen-like device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:58]** It has some ornate designs on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** Yeah, it has some writing on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:02]** So it's used to write things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:06]** Well, it's actually used to administer a small jolt of electricity.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:11]** It deals one electricity damage with a successful melee attack as an improvised weapon.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:17]** Mostly used to activate or deactivate ion bonding technology such as ion tape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:21]** So to get out of being taped or trapped, potentially?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:22]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:24]** Correct.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:26]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:26]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:29]** Oh, there was something that I wanted to tell you.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:31]** This is what I meant to tell you.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** I forgot to tell you this last time.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:39]** Lozu gave all of you, well, just in general, she has a pair of incendiary grenades, one.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:44]** She grabbed them from her room when the pirates originally attacked.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** She had them on her.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** She's given those to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** I'll take one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:49]** Okay.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** This was last time.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** Just wanted to cover this last time.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:54]** As much as I hate grenades, I'll try it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:57]** You're just like, yeah, it's fine.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:58]** Kev's been scarred for life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** Is that... Grenades fall under weapons or gear?

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** Probably weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** Weapons.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:08]** The ion tape for the zip stick makes sense from a bounty hunter perspective, and I'm pretty sure...

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:21]** uh i'm pretty sure that you found those when you opened up this suitcase tears back like 20 episodes ago in trust next room i'm pretty sure that you found those found i on tape

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:23]** Yeah, two rolls of ion tape.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:29]** 90% sure, because I remember you looked through the suitcase, right?

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:32]** And so you had looked through, that's where you had found the note.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:39]** And then that's because that's where you found the package with the note.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:42]** And you also found two rolls of ion tape.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:46]** So now it makes sense why there's that zip stick that activates ion tape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:49]** Sorry, you said it was Incendiary Grenades 1?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** Incendiary Grenade 1.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:51]** Yep.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:56]** Just want to make sure that we got all the stuff that we're keeping track.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:59]** There's a lot of stuff to have, a lot of stuff that's in there.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:03]** So, Rick, you had done a perception check on the room.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:07]** Nico, you did a perception check and a sense motive on Algiata.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:08]** Dr.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:11]** O.K., you were going to do a life science check on Algiata, correct?

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:11]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:12]** Okay.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:15]** Identify creature, I suppose.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:22]** And I have an attunement with my crystal micro lab to astrozoan biology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** And what does that attunement do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:40]** i guess i don't like for certain things i guess like it's for injections so it's not for this so i won't try and do it i'll just roll the life science got it okay roll but

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:51]** In certain instances, I can use an injection weapon without making an attack roll against creatures for which I have attuned my custom micro lab to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:56]** Ah, so if you knew they were an astrozoan, you wouldn't need to make an attack roll with your cost eject.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** I wouldn't need to.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** Awesome.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** That's a cool thing.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:02]** Kev, you had something with your bounty hunter and you're also raising your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:07]** Yeah, I'm trying to silently cue you to call up.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:28]** it's fine just share with the class uh yeah my bounty hunter skill says i get to reduce the dc of culture or profession which is my bounty hunter checks to recall knowledge about your mark as well as to recall knowledge about law enforcement individuals and practices by five and i chose my mark blah blah if i if i don't use it then yeah okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** So that would mean what?

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** That would mean... And astrozoans were your mark?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:34]** No.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** Starfish?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:42]** So this allows you to recall knowledge about them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:42 - 00:21:12]** about the real Algiata about the real Algiata interesting interesting interesting interesting this is great this is why this game is the best here's here's now seeing that walks in and goes behind this crate right in the bottom inside the bottom door and he is gonna check like is there anything that comes up from that detect magic

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** that's still active.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** Ah, thank you.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:16]** Yeah.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:21]** So the reason why I'm going through all these is because I'm kind of imagining these are all happening at the same time.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** And I will round it all out.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** Yeah, round it all out by saying that Lozu walks in.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** Nico, you moved up.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** Don't move anymore, Nico.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:34]** So Lozu walked in right behind you, hears, and Nico, well, not Nico, but hears.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:41]** And Lozu hears, you hear her say under her voice, like, Algiata, Algiata.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:49]** But Lozu is like very confused and knowing what she knows about the captain, she has the same level of suspicion as all of you.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:54]** And here's, you can see out of the corner of her eye that, that her hand is moving to her azimuth laser pistol.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** Let's go through this in order.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:00]** Here's, you do detect that there is magic.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:01]** What's the range?

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** 60 feet.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** 60 feet.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:11]** You detect that there is one magic item and one hybrid item that are further back in the crate.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:16]** How well can you localize things?

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** Can you localize it to like a foot or just in general?

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:21]** Like it's within like a direction maybe?

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** It does not say.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:25]** No.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** Okay.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:35]** I'll just say it's within, for ease of this whole thing, I'll say there is one magic item and one hybrid item inside the crate.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:36]** Okay.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:39]** Dr. Okay, what was the results of your life science check?

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:39]** 90-19.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:41]** 90-19.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** Okay.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:45]** And that was just to... Yeah.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:46]** What's your bonus?

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:49]** Total of 30.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** 30.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** Okay.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:51]** 30.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** Yeah.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:56]** You were just trying to see what, if she is who she says she is?

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:58]** Is she an astrozoan?

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** Is she a human?

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:06]** Is, you know, is there any telltale sign of... Rhyphorion.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** Rhyphorion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:12]** Nico, you had done a perception and a...

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** Sense motive check.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** Your perception... Yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:18]** I'd done that as I was moving.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:22]** I was speaking as I was moving and kind of... That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:29]** I just didn't want you to move anymore because we're in this... I'm just trying to keep in this weird phase where we're all acting together at the same time and trying to cover it and make sure we're good.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:34]** Nico, you don't sense anything weird about her.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:43]** And she does look like she has been, for lack of a better word, her armor that before was pristine and crisp now seems dirty.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:47]** And she does look like she has been through something for sure.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** That seems believable to you.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:51]** Now, Dr. O.K.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** and Rick, Dr.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** O.K.,

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:57]** Maybe it was the way she flexed her fingers.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:59]** Maybe it was the way that she blinked.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:02]** But something just seems a little off.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** And you can't put your finger on it.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** But it just...

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** It just seems a little weird.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:14]** I mean, to be fair, you saw Algiada at the very beginning in episode one and two in the hangar.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:22]** You saw her in episode, what is it, six in the engineering with Trostenek, and you haven't seen her since.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** So maybe you're wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:34]** I can't quite confirm, but we know now that Trostnik and Algiada were astrozoans since Liberty Station, at least, if not longer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** That thought does linger in your mind, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:41]** And we know for a fact that Trostnik was an astrozoan, because we...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:41 - 00:25:05]** killed him well nick nico killed him i think point point of order rick you uh what did you get your hunter's mark was to tell you if that's for culture i didn't roll it so you're going to roll profession sure yeah uh so that's going to be that's going to be information from on algiata not on bifurcans or estrus zones okay so it's a plus four okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:07]** Ten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:08]** Ten.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** Yeah.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** I mean, her story makes sense.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:13]** Like, Rhyforian's Algiata makes sense.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:24]** But I will say this, Rick, as you're thinking about this, and all of you are thinking about this collectively, Rick, you do hear something up in the far northeast corner of the room.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** You hear, like, a little, like,

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:34]** And sounds maybe like a footstep or something hit against a container.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:37]** It sounds like something or someone is up there.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** Like behind something?

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** It just sounds like a sound.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** Possibly like a foot moving.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** So what do you all do?

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:49]** Algiata's looking at you with eyes pleading for help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:59]** Rick's going to keep his gun trained on her, and he's going to flick his other hand behind his back at Dr. O.K.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:03]** and wave his head over towards the crate that made the noise.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** Okay.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:10]** Um, and then he's going to step one closer to Algiana and say, keep your hands where I can see them.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** We need confirmation that you are actually Algiana.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** It's me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** Who else would I be?

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:22]** I'm not one of, I don't know.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:24]** One of those things.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** What things?

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** You know, those things.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** Sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** Give me a sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:37]** That's a one, it looks like, on my dice.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** So, zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** You got a zero?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:44]** Well, it's a one minus one, but you can't go to zero, right?

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** So, I rolled a one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:47]** I'll also do that, then.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:49]** Okay.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** Eight.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:54]** She takes a step towards you and says, please, please.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:59]** And Lozu, Nico, behind you, you hear Lozu be like, we gotta help her, people.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:05]** We got a helper, and Lozu starts to take a few steps right near you, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** Nico, Nico, hold your back.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:08]** Hold on.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:09]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:12]** Okay, so here's moving off to the side.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** Dr.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** O.K., you're moving over to the side of the crate.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:22]** Nico, you are withholding Lozu, and Rick Algiata is right in front of you.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:23]** Dr.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:26]** O.K., as you turn around the corner...

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:36]** You are face-to-face with a human space pirate standing behind the crate.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** You need to roll for initiative.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:41]** Damn it.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:41]** All of us?

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:41]** Pirates.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** Yes, all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:45]** Oh, my God.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** Are you kidding me?

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** Why are these rolls so bad?

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:49]** 20.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:49]** 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:51]** Who got a 20 above?

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** I got a 20.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** Got a 20.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:54]** Anyone else?

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:56]** Cool.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** 15 and above?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:59 - 00:27:59]** 19.

**[00:27:59 - 00:27:59]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:03]** 17 from Dr. Okay.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:06]** 19 from Rick.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:08]** Or from Hears.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:09]** Rick, what'd you get?

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:29]** five five okay all righty and i will add in lozu who got a 17 who else got a 17 here's right she's gonna go after you nick oh you got a 1917 doctor okay got a 16 no i got a 20

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:51]** yeah 16 on the day 17 right but she got okay yeah she she got a total 16 so that makes sense because she's a little more sympathetic she's going to go after dr okay i will say this dr okay you put your hood up i know you're ready for battle i will say this there are two people who are going to go in the surprise round algiata

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** and Dr. Okay.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:56]** Rick, you failed your sense motive on Algiata.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** Did you move her closer to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:01]** Yeah, I said she took a step forward and said, please, please help me.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:02]** I did.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** It's alright.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** Dr. Okay, uh...

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** She will go first.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:22]** Rick, out of nowhere, you see that much like the Astrozoan in the gym, she reaches down and grabs what appears to be a knife.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:26]** And she comes up to stab at you.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:30]** That is going to be a 26 to hit.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:33]** What the hell?

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** Oh, my God.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:39]** That is a seven points of damage to Rick as she comes up to stab you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:40]** We're dead.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** I'm dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** Are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** I'm not actually dead.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:46]** No, I'm just saying this is going to be a hell of a fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** This is not easy.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** Yeah.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:53]** Dr. K, what are you doing on your surprise round?

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** Do you have a move action or a standard action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:58]** I'm...

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:05]** Can I slight of, like, I have a concealed property on my injection weapon.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:13]** Can I slight of hand, slight of handily go to attack?

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** Yeah, I mean, you... Or I have to equip it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:19]** Yeah, if it's not equipped, then... But I can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:24]** Like, since I get a plus four circumstance bonus to skill checks to hide objects...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:27]** But that's the hide object, right?

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:30]** What did you have equipped when you came in?

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:34]** Just my pistol across the jet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** Okay.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:37]** I suppose I can hit him with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:37]** You could.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** Is that ranged or melee?

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** It's melee, right?

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** Ranged.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:41]** It's ranged.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:45]** Ooh, then you will... Oh, people who are surprised don't get attacks of opportunity.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** Pretty sure.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:48]** Right, rules lawyer?

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** 90% sure.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** Surprise rules.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** I don't recall.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:53]** What page is that on?

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:59]** I'm looking on Archives of Nethis, which is the place to go for anybody who needs it.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:05]** They're flat-footed, and if you're flat-footed, you don't get an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** I'll give that to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:12]** I mean, it would be good because then it helps out y'all.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** I feel like that just makes sense.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:17]** If you're surprised you can't take an attack for opportunity, that just doesn't make sense to me.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:19]** So I'm going to roll it that way.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** If you disagree, let me know.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:23]** And otherwise, Dr. Okay, what do you want to do?

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** You want to attack with the cost of jet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:25]** Yes.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:32]** So do I just take a penalty if I am in melee range or can I take, I can only, I can only fire it.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:33]** Right?

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** Yeah, it's a real attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:37]** It will induce an attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:40]** Right, but you won't because they're flat-footed because they're surprised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:42]** They are surprised.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** They are surprised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** So there's no penalties?

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:46]** Right.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** Well, I don't know if there's a penalty.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:58]** The penalty would be the attack for opportunity, but is attacking a ranged attack in melee range, is there an actual penalty to it?

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:02]** No, you just incur an attack if I'm tuned.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** Okay, so there's no mechanical penalty.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** Great, so then you should totally do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:16]** Right, and I'm going to hit him with my most potent pharmacological inhibitor.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** Oh, OK.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** Hello, sir.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** Welcome.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** Oh, hello.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:24]** My name is Dr. OK.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** Are you feeling OK?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:34]** I think it makes sense that you weren't surprised, Dr. OK, because Rick said, I heard something over there.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** I need you to check.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** So you're on the lookout.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:38]** They were surprised that you moved over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** Okay, that's fair.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:41]** I thought you were saying that we were all surprised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:44]** No, only you were surprised, Rick, because you rolled a sense mode of low.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:48]** So I think, Dr.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** O.K., you're good.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** What did you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** I rolled an 18.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** 18!

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:01]** I look at him quite honestly and earnestly, and I'm talking to him.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:07]** And then a sort of dissolvable blob...

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:19]** of like goo sort of just erupts from this blaster in my tentacle sort of greasy hand i love it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:47]** right into his sort of like i guess like what do they call it like bread basket or like adam's apple oh yeah his throat yeah yeah yeah right there okay yeah so this space pirate standing in these like scraggly clothes that clearly have not been washed in weeks clutches at his throat as you uh use this this burst of slime on their throat so what does that do so i roll for damage

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:52]** But also roll a fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:55]** Roll a fortitude save.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** Yes, sir.

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:01]** Let's see.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:01]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** That passes.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:10]** So you merely have the encumbered condition.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:10]** Encumbered.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:11]** Okay.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:15]** But let me roll for damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** Yeah, how much damage is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Wait, did you just slime him?

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Is that what you did?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** It's the cost of jet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:21]** Max damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:22]** Six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** Six damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:36]** So as you do that, you see that some of the dirty clothes are covering a second skin armor that they're wearing very close to their body.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:43]** But that slime just seems to get in right at the edge and tuck into their skin and almost get under the armor.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** And they...

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:47]** just for a second, as the slime just totally cuts through.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:51]** That is not the voice that they used.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** Well done, Doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** This is not your slime, though.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:56]** This was your weapon that did this.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:16]** The slime... I also have a... The injection itself... Also, one of my feats is to... When I want to, I can inflict... Special property can use in my ammunition to lodge painfully in the creature's body.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:22]** the target takes an additional amount of damage equal to half my key ability modifier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:23]** Nice.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** So that's what happened with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** That's the extra damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:31]** That's the extra damage, which that would be the slime, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** Yeah.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** That's how I imagine it.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** I love it.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:36]** That's the flavor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** The flavor of slime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:41]** The flavor of slime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** Cool.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** Well done.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:46]** That was a good surprise round on all accounts.

**[00:35:46 - 00:36:10]** done top of round one let's get ready for this combat that i'm not gonna lie jinchiroga was tough then you guys had some good supercharged weapon moments there have been some tough combats that you guys have been lucky but now you're at the end of your rope and we will see now at the top around one how that works out it is the space pirate right in front of dr okay it is their turn and as they clutch

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:39]** at their throat from the pain of your injection they drop their pistol and one hand their face moves from pain into anger as they pull out this long sword and swing at you doctor okay that is going to be a 14 against your KAC I'm actually I'm actually okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** That doesn't hit?

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** That does not hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:44]** That doesn't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:44]** Okay.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:44]** Definitely okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:49]** Somehow in the slime stupor you've put them in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:53]** I think he misstepped when he got slimed and he just misjudged it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** 100%.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** It flows right by your face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:00]** It was like a killing blow probably.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Exactly.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Just.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Just missed.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:06]** I love it.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** I love it.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** Uh, okay.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:38]** gonna move away now all right it is algiata's turn after stabbing rick she's going to let go of the knife take a guarded step back and uh she is going to let's see she is going to oh i want to do something cool with this i actually really want to do something cool with this oh yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** I don't like how John's rolling.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:44]** Both of his characters rolled above a 20 on their initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:47]** Yeah, they rolled well on their initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:51]** I have rolled nothing above a 4 in the last 10 rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** You do, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:58]** I'm feeling kind of vulnerable over here, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:01]** Rick, what weapon did you have out?

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** By the way, there's a pirate.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:06]** Oh, yeah, guys, by the way, there's a pirate as you slimed him.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:09]** So this is some heated combat.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:12]** Lozu was starting to move forward, sympathetic.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:41]** towards Algiata until Algiata slammed a knife into Rick's leg and then Algiata lets go and Rick you see her reach up with her arms as she stands up and she tries to grab and rip your gun away from you what's your KAC my KAC plus 8 because it's a combat maneuver yeah what's your KAC plus 8 23 okay 23

**[00:38:41 - 00:39:06]** melee attack roll can she be 23 come on big money oh that is going to be a two so no so she goes up tries to grab your gun and pull it and just immediately realizes that she can't and let's go and so let's go she's still here

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:12]** She took a guarded step, but she probably took a guarded step in front of you because she had to move either way.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:15]** She would have incurred an attack opportunity moving anywhere around your thing.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:17]** So she took a guarded step in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** I don't have a melee weapon, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** Yeah.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:24]** So if you well, she is currently not holding anything because there's a knife in her leg.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:26]** So she's not holding anything at all right now.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** All right, Nico, it is your turn.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** What are you doing?

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:31]** So, John, I have a question for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** As always, please.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:43]** If I do a trick attack and they end up being flat-footed and I go to shoot them the next turn with a gun, they can't incur an attack of opportunity because they're flat-footed, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:48]** If they are flat-footed, I think we ruled that if they're flat-footed, they cannot make an attack for opportunity.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:53]** So that might... You cannot take reactions.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:58]** And I think an attack for opportunity is technically a reaction because you can do it at any point in the round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** So yes.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:03]** It says you can use your reaction to attack.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** But I can't use attack for opportunity because it's only melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:06]** Okay.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:12]** Well, Nico's going to say... He also doesn't have a weapon out right now at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:42]** Niko so she so unless she punched him she couldn't do anything so Niko is going to do a trick attack okay on Algiata he's gonna say hey two-face and he's gonna run up behind her so now now we got flanking here and he's going to do his first melee attack he's going to do a trick attack with his sword okay all right trick attack with sword give me your bluff check

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Oh, yeah!

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:48]** That's an 18 on the dice, plus 8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** 26.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:53]** Yeah, you can see her be surprised by how quickly you move up and behind her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:55]** Now I gotta roll to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:55]** Alright.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** So she is trick attacked.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** So she is flat footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** Oh, shit.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Oh, shit, John.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** What'd you roll?

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Natural.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:08]** 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:13]** Get out of town.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** Ridiculous.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** All right.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:16]** You want to do double?

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Well, it's the double damage.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:20]** You can either do the double damage or the card, right?

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** That's what we decided.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:23]** I'll let the group decide.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:25]** After 27 episodes, I always forget.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:30]** But I'm pretty sure it's you either do what the card says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Double damage.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** No, you do total damage plus the card.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** Oh, yeah, you're right.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:36]** Critical roll.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:39]** Well, because you do whatever your critical is.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Well, you're doing all your critical damages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** Is there critical effects for the weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** Let me double check that.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:45]** I'm not sure.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:48]** For the azimuth laser pistol, it's the burn, I think.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** It's the azimuth laser pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** You did it with the melee weapon, right?

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:51]** I did.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** I did it with the dueling sword.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:58]** I think for the azimuth laser pistol, it has the extra effect.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:01]** That is in addition to your double damage.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:03]** And you roll twice.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:06]** But the cards will replace your critical effects.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:13]** So if you use Hero Lab, it is... Like, the critical effects will be shown on the weapon pop-up.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:21]** But in the Lovely Core rulebook, it is listed on the weapon.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** It's also on the weapons, man.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Not the armory.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:30]** So you just cut this and insert the right book, because I don't know it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** So, um...

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:37]** There are no additional effects.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:39]** It's an analog weapon.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** Okay.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** So you're going to roll twice.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** That's a six on the first roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:43]** Uh-huh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:47]** That's a four on the second roll.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:50]** And now I got to roll a D4 for my trick attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:51]** Yep.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** And then you want to do the critical effect?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** Yep.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:58]** Does the card deck tell you how to use the card deck?

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:02]** So it should tell you if this replaces this or that on the card deck, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:08]** Yeah, you can either apply what the weapon has or what the card has, but not both.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:11]** So that's 13 points of damage.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** 13 points of damage.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:15]** I'm going to flip the deck here and tell me what you want to do.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** Tell me when to stop.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:16]** Ready?

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** 3, 2, 1.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** Stop.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:19]** Stop.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:20]** Okay.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Are we doing both?

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** You can't do both.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:28]** You can either do what the critical weapon already has as a critical effect or what the card has.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** But you get your double damage.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** Regardless.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:32]** And this happens in addition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:35]** And it is a melee weapon.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:37]** Light them up.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:42]** Your allies gain a plus one circumstance bonus to attack rolls against the target for one round.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:44]** Nice.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:47]** Yeah, against Algeata.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:50]** Nicely done.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:53]** So you all have a plus one for this round.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** I'm going to write that down here.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** So we all...

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:56]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:05]** So how I envision this is as he's running, he's going to do a forward somersault and do a reverse grip on the sword, and he's going to slice Algiata's leg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:10]** If you want to do all that, I need to have you make an acrobatics check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:35]** an acrobatics check 100 for the forward roll never mind i take it back yeah i'm just saying you already moved over here did your trick attack then ran you wouldn't need to tell me before if you want to do that totally fine if you do you can yeah but i'm just saying well then all right then this is how i envision it nico nico just kind of fakes like he's gonna shoot as he's running and just slashes across your stomach instead


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:56]** i like it okay 13 points of damage ridiculous impressive impressive impressive yeah she definitely takes a lot of people carrying dueling swords but that's quite impressive that was a good move good job and she is hurt from that for sure you want to do anything else with your turn

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** No, that's it.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:59]** That's a full action there.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** That is your full action.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:01]** Okay.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:07]** Rick, out of the corner of your eye, you see in the part of the room that you would heard a noise.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:15]** You see another female space pirate step out with the same raggedy clothes with some second skin underneath.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:26]** And they are going to take a step, move forward, and they are going to aim at you, Rick, since they didn't see Nico attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:28]** Good luck.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:28]** You look confused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:29]** Me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** I'm just nervous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:35]** Yeah, I am kind of nervous, kind of hoping I hit.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** So they're going to shoot you.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:39]** Oh, that's going to be a 10.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:42]** So that is definitely going to miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:45]** Is that KAC or EAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:48]** That is against KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:49]** That's a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** That is a miss.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:50]** All right.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** They take a shot at you.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:57]** Nico, you hear a shot come from over to your right in the north of the room.

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:00]** Hears, Lozu are both down below.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Hears, it's your turn.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:07]** Hears wants to daze Algiada.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** so that you can't do anything.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:13]** That's a will save and it's a DC of 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:18]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** Will save!

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** Let's see.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** DC what?

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:22]** 15.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** She crushed it.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** 23.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:24]** Come on.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:25]** She crushed it.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:26]** All good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:29]** Just killing it with these rolls.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:32]** Here's what's going to back behind this crate then.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** This is not too much you can do otherwise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:34]** Okay.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:35]** Okay.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:40]** You're going to get some partial cove from behind that crate from anything that's going over.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:40]** Okay.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** Good try.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:42]** Lozu.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** It's your turn.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:45]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:46]** Hmm.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:48]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:55]** Having heard the shots and from, or what just happened?

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** This lady.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:59]** What do you mean, what just happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** This one stepped out and took a shot at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** Yeah, she went out and took a shot.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** You might have seen that.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:08]** Yeah, you heard another shot coming from the corner of the room where you knew no one was.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:14]** So I'm going to be like, let's get them.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:14]** I don't know.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:22]** Anyway, I'm going to switch out to my... Wow, the enthusiasm from Dr. O'Kane is impressive.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:23]** Yes.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** There's more.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** They're over here.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:27]** They're over here.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:37]** And I'm going to pull out my... I'm going to, like, call... This is, like, the first round, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Yeah, this is round one.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:41]** You all have a plus one against Algiata.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** Algiata.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:43]** Okay.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:49]** I'm going to take out my syringe spear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:50]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:51 - 00:48:01]** And I imagine Dr. Archaic sort of, like, he has this sort of monk-like clothing on his, like, robes.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:02]** I love it.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:11]** So he draws out this staff-like spear with an injector property on it that I can quickly manipulate and use.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** Amazing.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:15]** And...

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:21]** He's going to go just for the numbers game.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:26]** I'm going to hit him again with the pharmacological inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Okay.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** Nice.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:28]** I love it.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** I love it.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:32]** The space pirate that's in front of you in the upper corner of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** Okay.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:36]** I'm sorry I didn't catch your name, sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:43]** I actually roll 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:45]** 17.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** Against KAC?

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** Yeah.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:52]** Against KAC, that is a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:59]** And as you hit, they're like, my name is Billy!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** Gosh, this pirate needs help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:08]** Billy, this may hurt a bit, but you'll feel better in the morning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:12]** I'm one day from retirement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:13]** I'm sorry.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:17]** Billy, I rolled a six, which is max damage.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** Eight points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** Eight points of damage?

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:25]** Wow, that really hurt.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** That really hurt, Billy.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** And roll a fort save.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** And roll a fort save.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** Oh, Billy.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:33]** Let's see if the fates have it that you will live.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:35]** It was his last job.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** He said that he was just going to do one more.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:40]** He was unwilling to, but he was like, I'll do it one more.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** That is an 11.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** I think he failed.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** Oh, man.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:46]** What condition does he have?

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** He was already encumbered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:52]** Yeah, so he has the entangled condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:52]** Oh, God.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** He can't even move.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** Wow.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Wow.

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:04]** So Billy just feels his whole body freeze up as this pharmacological inhibitor takes effect in his bloodstream.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:07]** This human space pirate, Billy.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:08]** Wow.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:09]** Impressive.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:11]** I'm loving this dice.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:13]** This dice is treating you well.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** It really is here.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:16]** All right.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:19]** It is the all-powerful Lozu's turn.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:32]** Lozu is going to... Rick, maybe you see briefly you catch Lozu's face as she goes from sympathy to hatred.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:59]** as she pulls out her azimuth laser pistol and she just aims right down the site and she is just going to take the most damnedest shot against algiata whoever this is right now with a plus one thank you a plus one against myself i am officially playing myself does does she have any other bonuses due to flanking on algiata no flanking only affects melee um

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:02]** So that is a 21 against Algiata.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:08]** And that is a hit from Lozu.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Wow.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:09]** Nice.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Wow.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** All right.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:11]** Get it, Lozu.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Come on, Lozu.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:16]** Dude, I am always low-key rooting for Lozu, just in general.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:22]** Just her character arc to go from being unsure to being a boss.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:27]** And she's a boss with two points of damage, chipping away as the shot comes out of nowhere.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:36]** You see the surprise on Algiata's face, first from being hit from behind by Nico, then from the side by Lozu.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** It is Rick's turn.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** Finally.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** Rick, what are you doing?

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** You've been hit and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:52]** Rick is going to shrug the artillery laser off his shoulder and then pull the greataxe from behind his back and just swing it right at her neck.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:54]** Just swing right at her neck.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** No mercy.

**[00:51:55 - 00:52:01]** And as he does it, he looks her in the eye and he says, we've already taken out half your crew.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** You're going down as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:06]** I changed the music for this because this is intense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:13]** So that is a 12 plus 4 plus 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:16]** That is a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** Yeah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:22]** You got some vengeance against her.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** Probably because she surprised you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** Is 7-11 on it?

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** Yeah, this is my D12.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:31]** So my great axe is a tactical style great axe.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** Outrageous.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:37]** It does one D12 plus S, or plus one of S, which is slicing damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** Slashing.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:39]** How much damage is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:43]** That is 10 plus one.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** So 11 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** Wow.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:55]** She looks pretty hurt as you cut into her clavicle and blood stains the already dirty armor that she had.

**[00:52:55 - 00:53:01]** Well done, vitriol and anger ooze from the axe.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:04]** It is round two, I believe.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** What was the thing we had for one round?

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** Five footed from the surprise round?

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:11]** No, that was just during the surprise round.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** Plus one from Algiata.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:14]** So that was from Nico, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:16]** Yeah, but has here's gone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:16]** Yes.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** He tried to daze.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** He tried to daze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Couldn't daze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** It is Billy's turn.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:27]** Billy at the top of round two is now encumbered and entangled.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:32]** But Billy is upset now that you did not

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:36]** help him out, Doctor, okay?

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:38]** You didn't let him go because he was one day away from retirement.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:42]** So Billy is going to slash you again with the long sword.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:44]** Come on, Billy.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:47]** It's a good thing, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:49]** He's pretty pissed because he just rolled a 24.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Yeah.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** Billy don't play.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:58]** There's a reason why Billy is retiring because he's a badass and is like, yo.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:01]** But he only deals five points of damage as he cuts into one of your tentacles.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** Five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:08]** I feel like I have some good armor.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** I mean, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** That Lushinta armor is dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** That Lushinta armor.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:16]** Was that the armor that Jinchiroga had?

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** Is that the one that you have?

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** Yeah.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** Yeah.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** That was some pretty sweet armor.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** All right.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** Oh, this is what I've been waiting for.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:28]** I've been waiting to see what I could do next.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** Okay.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** Do I risk it?

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** Play it safe.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:39]** It's a question.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** It's Algiata's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** She's in a bad spot, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** I know.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:43]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** Does she risk it?

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** Does she risk her biscuit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:50]** I think she just stands there perfectly still for the next five rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** Yeah, weird.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:52]** That's so weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** She's in a daze like Lozu was?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** Except she's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** She is flat-footed.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** Except she is not.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** We did try.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:03]** She is flat-footed, but you know what she's going to do?

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** She's smart.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:10]** She's going to take a guarded step up away from the two of you.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:21]** And she's going to take another guarded step up away from the two of you using two move actions in order to make that happen.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** It is Nico's turn.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** She takes two steps away.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** That was very anticlimactic.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Nico, what are you doing with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** Be careful, Nico.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:29]** There are more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:34]** So, Nico is... They're strong up here.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:40]** This man, he's stronger than me.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** Yeah.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:46]** Dr. Okay's not okay right now.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** That was impressive.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:48]** That was great.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** That was so great.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:55]** Nico's going to, as seeing Algiata, take two kind of guarded steps back.

**[00:55:56 - 00:56:02]** As he finishes his follow-through on his first slash, he's going to point his gun over at her.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:06]** And he's going to look over and...

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** John, I want to see if I can do this.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** Can I roll a deception roll on this?

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:14]** What I want to say is the starfish send their regards.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** The starfishers?

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** Yeah, the starfishers send their regards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** And what are you trying to do here?

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:24]** What's the mechanical outcome that you want to have happen?

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:25]** Deception.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:26]** But what?

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:31]** Like disadvantage or just to deceive her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:32]** Deceive her.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:34]** It would be a bluff, not deception.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:34]** Yeah, bluff.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:35]** Okay, that's fine.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:38]** Yeah, because there's no deception.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:40]** So you just want to bluff her in general.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:41]** Yeah.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** Okay, that's fine.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** I want to bluff.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:47]** One, I want to affect what she's thinking, but two, I also want to do my trick attack as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:50]** So that would just be part of your trick attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:51]** All right, let's do it then.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:54]** So you saying that would be part of your bluff for the trick attack.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** So that's 12 on the die plus 8.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:59]** 20?

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** Yeah.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:05]** She seems unfazed by what you said, and mechanically it means you did not get the trick attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** Okay.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** Okay.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:14]** So that's a four on the die plus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** That's seven.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:15]** Yeah.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:18]** Doesn't hit even with the minus two that she has.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:20]** How long is trick attack for one round?

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** The end of next turn?

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:22]** Yeah.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:22]** Yeah.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** Okay.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** So now it's the end of your turn.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:27]** So now she gets her plus two AC back, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** She's no longer flat-footed.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:29]** Yeah.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** Okay.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:30]** Got it.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:31]** Got it.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** Good attempt, though.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** I like that thinking.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:35]** I like it.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:39]** Just didn't quite work out for you.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** All right.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** It is...

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:55]** The female space pirates turn, and she is going to take some steps forward, and she, having seen the shot that came from the corner, she's going to level a shot at Nico.

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:00]** Let's see if she can hit Nico Orion.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** What's your KAC?

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** KAC.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** KAC will be...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:35]** is it above 23 that's what she rolled no okay you get hit with a tactical semi-auto pistol for six points of damage that as it really just crushes into your leg yeah she shot you with a tactical semi-auto pistol you look surprised i i didn't think you haven't taken damage in a while no i didn't think those can do that much damage i thought they were d4 nope


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:39]** Which one, a tactical semi-auto or is it a 1D6?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:43]** That's what I'm reading here in the book, unless they messed that up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** I have one in my pocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:49]** You have a tactical semi-auto pistol in your pocket?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:50]** Yeah.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:51]** Rick gives it as a backup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:52]** Here's.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** It is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:56]** All right.

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:01]** Here's is going to move up to where this is the actions going on.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** So that's up to here.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:04]** And he's going to try to daze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:07]** One square at a time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** Here we go.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:12]** So here's is moving up from the south where Lozu is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:12]** Correct.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:16]** Towards the north where everybody's clustered around just behind Nico.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:20]** So he's going to try to daze again.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:21]** Daze again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** Make a will save.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:26]** Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** We'll save.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Yeah, that's a 10.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** I think that's a fail.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** Yeah.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:36]** All right, good.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** That is a fail.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** All right.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:39]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:43]** So what is the... Your will has broken me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:45]** So she cannot take action.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:46]** Your will is broken.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** For the next round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** Oh, God.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** God.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:49]** Yeah.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** So she's dazed?

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:53]** She's dazed.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** Okay.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:54]** For the next round.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:56]** Until the end of your next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:58]** It says duration one round.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** Whatever that is, that's what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** Duration one round.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:04]** I would think that that is until the next time.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:09]** Until this time next round three.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:10]** Got it.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:12]** Until the end of your turn, round three.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** Wow, we really just drew that out.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:15]** We talked about that as many ways as possible.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** Well done here.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** She is dazed.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** Dr.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** O.K., what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:23]** Oh, boy.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:29]** Can I see, like, can I do, like, perception check?

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:31]** Just quickly, like, see this guy.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** Can I get a good look at him?

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** Like, how's his condition?

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** He's bloodied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** Which I think we talked about for what that means.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** Yeah.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:40]** It's fairly obvious.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:45]** He is entangled, encumbered, has slime and blood on his last day before retirement.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** He's not doing great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** Suffice it to say.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:52]** He should have cut his losses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:54]** He could have, but whatever.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:57]** You should fall asleep, sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:59]** You should fall asleep.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** Was that your attempt to try and get him to be okay?

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:04]** To be like, just fall asleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** I'll pretend you're dead.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** Yes.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** Exactly.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:08]** Exactly.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** Okay, I like it.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** I like it.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:16]** So I'm going to roll, and I'm just going to try and hit him with a basic inhibitor.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** Basic inhibitor.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** To do what?

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:26]** So, like, I guess, because I do, like, and I wouldn't have any, like, damage resistance or anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:31]** You would need to do a life science to see if there's any of that.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** See about human pirate.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:35]** But you would think no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:36]** I'll just say that in general.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:45]** Okay, so I'll just try to hit him with a basic inhibitor that gives him a minus two penalty to his AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:49]** Wow, as if he didn't already have a lot from being, that from being entangled.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** Yeah.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:51]** 14.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:53]** 14.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:54]** That was already a minus two.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:56]** That is definitely a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:57]** Oh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** Yeah.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:01]** All right.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:03]** How much damage did you do?

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** Seven points of damage.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:06]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** Wow.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:13]** Billy looks on the brink of death.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:37]** he really is almost not having a good time he is almost just standing up because of the entangled like the entanglement the like paralysis in his legs is what is almost holding him up because he can't move he is just barely able to stand that is impressive oh wow okay okay okay okay okay okay okay i like it i like it a lot

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** You want to do anything else with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:50]** I'm going to move and try to get after Algiana or get within sight of Algiana.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:51]** You're just leaving.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:53]** You're just leaving Billy.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:54]** You're like, all right, Billy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:58]** Billy can't take an attack of opportunity, right?

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:59]** He's entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:01]** You're correct about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:02]** I was thinking about sliming.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** Do you think I should?

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** You want to slime Billy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:07]** I think you need to make your own decisions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:21]** I'm just going to, before I leave, for the last time today, I'm going to... Is that a bonus action?

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:22]** Swift action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:23]** Swift?

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:29]** Before I go, just remember to drink plenty of water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:33]** Just remember to drink plenty of water.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:34]** Oh, my goodness.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:35]** All right.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:36]** So then slide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:39]** And I just all over the floor.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:44]** Enjoy your retirement.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:46]** That's funny.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** Congratulations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:51]** Congratulations on retirement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:54]** Amazing.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:55]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:55 - 01:04:00]** I'm going to keep my eye on him, but I hope that he doesn't attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:01]** Okay.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:01]** All right.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:03]** Makes sense.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:05]** Hopefully, Billy will enjoy his retirement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:07]** Billy, rethink your life, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:09]** You want to go home and rethink your life.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:12]** Well done.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:14]** Good turn, Doctor.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** Okay.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:18]** It is Lozu's turn.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:21]** Here's Rick, Nico.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:37]** As you're focused on Algiata being dazed and Doctor Okay talking to Billy soothingly, you hear from behind you this scream in the back of your throat like...

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:44]** And there's this cry from Lozu of just, this is for the captain.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:51]** And Lozu charges forward to bull rush Algiata and shove her into the crates.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:53]** Kevin's like, finally, she's turned.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:54]** Yeah.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:56]** No, dude.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** Wow.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:59]** You shoot her as she's coming towards you.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** No, she is going to run.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:02]** I knew it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:17]** you think she's running towards you and then and then she moves at the last second to run towards algiata and she is going to bull rush algiata nice let's see what she does

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:25]** Oh, she might have a chance to bull rush Algiata.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:27]** Let's see.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:28]** That is going to be that.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:29]** Wow, she got it.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:39]** So you just see her lower her shoulder and charge into Algiata as Algiata flies back and just slams with this loud thud.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:41]** I picture it right as Dr. OK, you came around the corner.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:43]** Algiata, boom.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:49]** just slams into the crate next to you, and you're like, oh, I didn't realize this was going on behind me, but all right, cool.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:52]** That sounds like I'm definitely down for this.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:58]** Yeah, and she is pissed, and it is now going to be Rick's turn.

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:00]** What are you doing, Rick, at the bottom of round two?

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:02]** What's your move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:07]** Rick is going to run up here right next to her.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:07]** Uh-huh.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:13]** And he's going to look her in the eye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:14]** Is she on the ground, you said?

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:19]** No, she's just pinned against the... Well, not pinned, but she is against the crit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:26]** He's going to look at her and say, Give up now, Yox, and then take a swing with the axe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:32]** But I'm going to do non-lethal, which is probably going to screw everything up.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:35]** So non-lethal is a minus four, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:38]** Non-lethal is a minus four, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:41]** And this is a plus four to hit.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:44]** So this is just going to be whatever the dice rolls.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:45]** Actually, no.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:47]** Whatever the dice rolls.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** I don't care if she dies.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:50]** And not because I'm a murder bot.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:52]** Oh, is that not the reason?

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:54]** I know it's the astrozoic.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:55]** Just to make it clear.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:55]** Oh, okay.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:57]** It's not because you're Murderbot.

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:57]** Kelly!

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:01]** That's 11 on KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:03]** Murderbot!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:06]** Murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:07]** Murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:08]** Sorry, Kev, that's a what?

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:09]** 11.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:17]** 11 against her KAC that does not meet that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:23]** So, yeah, Rick threatens her and says, like, he tells, quote, unquote, her, because I don't know.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:23]** Yucks.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:25]** Anyways, yucks.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:26]** Give up now.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:28]** And then swings the axe at her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:30]** Swing your axe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:33]** Swings right over her head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:34]** Lethally, yeah.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:35]** Swings right over her head.

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:41]** Hits the crate, clearly indicating that it was lethal.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:44]** That it would have been lethal if you had wanted it to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:45]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:46]** The top of round three.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:48]** Top of round three.

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:54]** Fighting in the Port Cargo Bay for the relic.

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:55]** What is the relic?

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:56]** Who is Algiata?

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:58]** What is going on?

**[01:07:58 - 01:07:59]** Who knows?

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:01]** But it's the top of round three.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:02]** And Dr.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:06]** O.K., from around the corner, you hear Billy say...

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:10]** I've never given up a day in my life.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:13]** And steps into the slime square.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:16]** So that is difficult terrain, correct?

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:17]** Is.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:18]** Okay.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:25]** They're going to step into the slime square, look down at their mucky boots, and they are going to aim a shot at you.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:31]** I'm so sorry, but your friend was not quite your friend.


## Speaker_0

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:34]** I hate to tell you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:34]** Billy!

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:35]** No!

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:39]** Go home and rethink your life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:43]** So that is an extra 5, 10, 15, 20.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:43]** Okay.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:47]** Yeah, so they're going to step up and they're going to swing again at you with the long sword.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:51]** Which just barely, that's like the end of their movement.

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:54]** That is a 20 to hit.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:55]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:58]** With the encumbered and the entangled condition?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:00]** They can't move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:02]** Through difficult terrain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:03]** Oh, scratch all that.

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:06]** They can't even move because of the entangled condition, right?

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:07]** Entangled.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:09]** Impedes your movement, but it's not entirely preventive.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:11]** You move at half speed.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:16]** So already moving at half speed, which is going to be 15, and then reduced by 10 feet.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:17]** 15 cumbered also.

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:18]** They can't even do that.

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:19]** Yeah.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:21]** So they're going to take a step up.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:45]** here and they have the sword and they are going to so they take a five foot step in that is lit they can literally take five feet of movement sorry about everything else they are going to drop their uh long sword and they're going to pull out their tactical semi-auto pistol and level it at you but they cannot fire right now

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:50]** It would be Algiata's turn, but she can't do anything because she's dazed.

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:52]** That daze spell really gets you.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:53]** Really gets you.

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:54]** Nico, it's your turn.

**[01:09:54 - 01:09:55]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:57]** Nico is going to do...

**[01:09:58 - 01:10:04]** Nico is going to do his quickfire signature forward roll after getting shot.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:07]** Signature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:07 - 01:10:08]** I don't know if you can call it a signature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:11]** I've done it three times.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:12]** I think it's a signature now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:13]** You can't even call yourself quickfire.

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:15]** Give me an acrobatics check, Nick.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:18]** Fast shot does his quick roll.

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:19]** Quick roll.

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:20]** Fast shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:22]** 18 on the roll.

**[01:10:22 - 01:10:25]** Plus my modifier.

**[01:10:25 - 01:10:25]** I think I succeed.

**[01:10:25 - 01:10:26]** Yeah.

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:27]** Yeah.

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:28]** You succeed.

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:29]** So you're going to roll over.

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:31]** Uh-huh.

**[01:10:31 - 01:10:34]** And he's going to do a trick attack on Algiata.

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:37]** And he's going to be like...

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:39]** They hired me to take you out.

**[01:10:39 - 01:10:42]** And that's his bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:43]** What?

**[01:10:43 - 01:10:44]** It's a bluff.

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:44]** Oh, it's a bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:46]** That's your trick attack bluff?


## Speaker_0

**[01:10:47 - 01:10:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:47 - 01:10:48]** I was like, dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:50]** Nico's actually an assassin.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:51]** Nico, surprise.

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:53]** Nico is the assassin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:55]** It was him the whole time.

**[01:10:55 - 01:10:57]** All that murder bot talk is just projected as Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:57 - 01:10:58]** Who would have expected?

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:00]** Who would have expected it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:02]** That sense motive in like episode two.

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:03]** What the fuck?

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:06]** We drank together and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:08]** For all listeners at home, this is a joke.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:09]** Nico is not the assassin.

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:11]** There's no way Nico would be an assassin.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:12]** He'd be the worst assassin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:13]** He's not very good at what he does.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:15]** 16 on the dice.


## Speaker_0

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:15]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:16]** Okay.

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:18]** Plus eight, 24 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:19]** Yeah.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:24]** Do we know that this is an obvious bluff, but we're hoping that she doesn't?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:25]** Yeah.

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:25]** Well, she's dazed.

**[01:11:26 - 01:11:28]** So you definitely get the trick attack.

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:30]** She definitely is flat footed now.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:33]** And does she believe you?

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:33]** I don't know.

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:34]** Did the words process?

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:35]** I don't know.

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:36]** Make your attack roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:42]** Plus three to a 17 gets me 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:42 - 01:11:43]** Wow.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:43]** Impressive.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:44]** Yes.

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:45]** Yes.

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:47]** So excited about that.

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:47]** 78 gets me 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:48]** Give me your roll.

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:49]** Give me your roll.

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:51]** I said three on the first.

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:54]** Oh, hold on.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:54]** Dirty die.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:55]** Let me roll again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:59]** That's a four on the second.

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:02]** Three on the first, four on the second, and the extra D4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:07]** That was the extra.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:08 - 01:12:10]** Okay, so seven points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:12]** This is a lethal attack, right?

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:13]** Seven points of damage.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:14]** She's going to die.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:16]** We went long two episodes ago.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:17]** Do you guys want to go?

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:19]** Do you want to see if we can finish this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:20]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:21]** Yeah.

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:22]** You want to finish it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:23]** Let's take him out.

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:24]** You want to finish it?

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:24]** Let's do it.

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:25]** Let's do it.

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:26]** Just make them all give up now.

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:27]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:29]** That is technically in the rule book, just so you know.

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:30]** I found this out.

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:31]** You can do that.

**[01:12:31 - 01:12:34]** You can technically just be like... Attention all Will Save listeners.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:40]** Once a certain point is reached, it kind of says if you just want to wrap up the fight, you can wrap up the fight.

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:46]** But that's not what's going to happen because that's not what we do here on Will Save and we don't walk away from challenges like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:48]** Attention Will Save listeners.

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:51]** You're getting a special episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:54]** Taking it into overtime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:57]** Nico, taking it into overtime.

**[01:12:57 - 01:12:58]** Taking it into overtime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:12:58 - 01:13:00]** Hashtag Buffalo Wild Wings is giving you extra wings now.

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:00]** Oh, man.

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:03]** It's like the bonus fry at McDonald's fries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:05]** It's going to be great.

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:08]** It'll be fucking balls great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:09]** Fucking sweet.

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:11]** Let's finish this out with some energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:13]** Nico.

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:14]** Nico.

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:15]** Well done.

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:16]** Good trick attack.

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:17]** Good bluff-a-roo.

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:28]** It is, as soon as my roll 20 loads, it is the space pirate's turn who is next to up here in the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:30]** Can we get a bleed condition on Algiata?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:32]** No, there's no bleed.

**[01:13:32 - 01:13:33]** There's nothing mechanically that would do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:35]** No, no, no.

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:35]** That's not what I meant.

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:37]** I think you misunderstand.

**[01:13:37 - 01:13:38]** How is she?

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:39]** What's her condition?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:40]** You can do a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:42]** Oh, I'll just tell you.

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:42]** She's bloody.

**[01:13:43 - 01:13:44]** She's very bloody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:44 - 01:13:45]** Okay.

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:46]** Yeah.

**[01:13:47 - 01:13:49]** So it is the space pirate's turn.

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:52]** She's going to walk up.

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:54]** She is not flat footed at all.

**[01:13:54 - 01:13:57]** And she is going to walk up next to Algiata.

**[01:13:57 - 01:14:01]** And she is going to look at Algiata and see all of you there.

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:04]** And she is going to point her gun at Hears.

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:07]** And she is going to fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:09]** I thought that might happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:09 - 01:14:10]** Yeah.

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:10]** Oh yeah.

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:11]** You knew that was going to happen.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:12]** Let's see.

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:16]** Oh, 16 against KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:17]** Yeah.

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:20]** My regular KAC, which is not the modified one is 13.

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:20]** So that does hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:21]** Yeah.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:22]** I figured it did.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:27]** That is going to be seven points of damage from an expert marksman shot.

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:28]** She's killing it.

**[01:14:29 - 01:14:30]** Uh, seven points of damage to you.

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:31]** Here's here's what are you at?

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:33]** I mean, now I had that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:34]** Don't tell him secrets.

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:36]** Oh yeah.

**[01:14:36 - 01:14:36]** That's a fair point.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:37]** Yeah.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:37]** All right.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:38]** You know what?

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:39]** Roll perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:42]** All right, I'm just going to roll Perception on Hero Lab.

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:42]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:48]** So, well done, human space pirate number two.

**[01:14:49 - 01:14:49]** What is her name?

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:50]** You may never know.

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:52]** You've never asked.

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:53]** Here's, it's your turn.

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:54]** What are you doing?

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:55]** You've just been shot.

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:57]** You're across the room.

**[01:14:57 - 01:14:58]** You got a magic missile on you, buddy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:14:59 - 01:15:03]** Yeah, I wish, except I haven't slept in 20 years, basically, at this point.

**[01:15:04 - 01:15:05]** Y'all are at the end of your ropes.

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:06]** True.

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:08]** I will try to daze her.

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:12]** You're going to try and daze her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:12 - 01:15:13]** You have no offensive cantrips?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:17]** That is my offensive cantrip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:20]** She got a natural 20 for 23.

**[01:15:20 - 01:15:20]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:26]** Dude, she is... Do you have any cantrips that will do damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:26 - 01:15:26]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:29]** No, I don't.

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:30]** Well done, Hears.

**[01:15:30 - 01:15:31]** You want to do anything else with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:37]** You know... Hears is going to...

**[01:15:37 - 01:15:38]** Oh, geez.

**[01:15:38 - 01:15:47]** All right, here's just going to try to take the offensive advantage away, I guess, or the range advantage and kind of move up.

**[01:15:47 - 01:15:48]** Okay.

**[01:15:48 - 01:15:49]** I don't know if this is a good idea.

**[01:15:49 - 01:15:50]** Maybe I'm going to go.

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:51]** Can I go in this crate?

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:52]** Yeah.

**[01:15:52 - 01:15:52]** The one to your right?

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:55]** Yeah, I want to see if that... Yeah, the big crate?

**[01:15:55 - 01:15:56]** Yeah, the big crate.

**[01:15:56 - 01:16:00]** I'm going to try to go in there and hide behind the relic.

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:03]** The magical item that you're looking for?

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:04]** Correct.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:05]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:07]** I'm not going to steal it and run away.

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:09]** Of course Dr. O.K.

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:11]** would think that I'm just going to peace out, but I'm not.

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:13]** Because we're talking about Dr. Okay here.

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:17]** Because Dr. Okay peaces out, so of course he assumes people will peace out.

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:18]** Exactly.

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:19]** We all remember that.

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:22]** What I want to do is I want to check out this relic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:23]** Maybe it can be of use to us.

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:24]** Episode four.

**[01:16:25 - 01:16:29]** It's in the box though with the biometrics on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:33]** For the listeners at home, let's describe this crate.

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:36]** The room has a large crate in the middle of it.

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:37]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:40]** From various checks.

**[01:16:40 - 01:16:47]** And there's the door on the outside has been, the computerized locks have been destroyed and the physical latches were bent off.

**[01:16:47 - 01:16:52]** The door is on its side and whatever debris was in there is littered in front of the crate.

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:56]** But inside the crate, it is spotless except here as you step in.

**[01:16:56 - 01:17:00]** In the corner, there appears to be a small book bag.

**[01:17:00 - 01:17:04]** And I think it hasn't quite been a minute since this really started.

**[01:17:05 - 01:17:06]** We're kind of at the end of your detect magic.

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:09]** You can tell that the magic is coming from the book bag.

**[01:17:11 - 01:17:16]** But you do walk past the center pedestal, which has this small silvery box on it.

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:19]** And on one side, there is a biometric scanner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:17:19 - 01:17:22]** And by large crate, we mean like it's a 20 by 20 foot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:22 - 01:17:23]** It's a huge crate.

**[01:17:23 - 01:17:26]** And it is clearly the dominating thing in this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:27]** All right.

**[01:17:27 - 01:17:28]** But there's not a hug bot in it.

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:29]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:29 - 01:17:29]** So we're okay.

**[01:17:29 - 01:17:30]** Or a Vesk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:32]** Well done.

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:33]** Or a murder bot.

**[01:17:33 - 01:17:34]** So, okay, got it.

**[01:17:34 - 01:17:35]** I can't do anything else.

**[01:17:35 - 01:17:37]** I can't hack or anything at this time.

**[01:17:37 - 01:17:38]** It takes a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:38 - 01:17:39]** Yeah, you're right.

**[01:17:39 - 01:17:43]** Yeah, it would be a move action to look through.

**[01:17:44 - 01:17:45]** Manipulate an item.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:17:45 - 01:17:46]** With a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:46 - 01:17:47]** Yeah, it would have to be a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:48]** So on your next turn, you can do whatever you want.

**[01:17:48 - 01:17:49]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:49 - 01:17:51]** And at the end of your turn...

**[01:17:51 - 01:17:58]** Rick and Lozu and Nico, you see Algiata kind of blink and snap out of it as she comes out of the daze.

**[01:17:59 - 01:18:00]** And she looks pissed.

**[01:18:01 - 01:18:02]** Pissed.

**[01:18:02 - 01:18:03]** Dr. O'Kane's return.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:06 - 01:18:07]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:18:07 - 01:18:08]** Stop calling her Algiata.

**[01:18:08 - 01:18:09]** Billy.

**[01:18:09 - 01:18:10]** Its name is Yox.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:10 - 01:18:16]** I am sorry for your distress, young man.

**[01:18:18 - 01:18:24]** Enjoy your evening and afternoon as best you can.

**[01:18:25 - 01:18:26]** And you're just, what do you do?

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:35]** Uh, I'm going to sort of deftly pick up or equip my, uh, costa jet.

**[01:18:36 - 01:18:36]** Yeah.

**[01:18:58 - 01:19:03]** Places the costa jet in my hand, and I just pull the trigger.

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:04]** Nice.

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:05]** At Billy.

**[01:19:06 - 01:19:15]** At Billy with the... I think it's my last trick.

**[01:19:15 - 01:19:16]** Okay.

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:19]** Which is... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:20 - 01:19:43]** a just a regular minor inhibitor okay that would be i haven't been asking you how long these last but i assume not for long okay so each one is for the inhibitors seven rounds okay oh my god ridiculous damn okay hit that minor inhibitor give me your roll

**[01:20:08 - 01:20:11]** Let's see.

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:14]** Three plus five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:20]** The slime, as he holds up the pistol, the slime covers his arm.

**[01:20:20 - 01:20:24]** It hits his chest, and he collapses and falls to his knees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:20:25 - 01:20:31]** He dies, and he says, You can have my starfisher pension.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:54 - 01:20:55]** Well done, Dr. Okay.

**[01:20:55 - 01:20:55]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:55 - 01:20:58]** I mean, it was an ambush, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:58 - 01:21:00]** It was an ambush, and you ambushed him, to be fair.

**[01:21:01 - 01:21:01]** You took him out.

**[01:21:03 - 01:21:04]** Well done.

**[01:21:05 - 01:21:08]** It is Lozu's turn.

**[01:21:09 - 01:21:10]** What does she do?

**[01:21:10 - 01:21:11]** Pissed at the captain.

**[01:21:12 - 01:21:23]** Ready to take charge, she aims her pistol at Algiata and says, You're dead.

**[01:21:23 - 01:21:24]** Just not like that.

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:30]** That is going to be a 18 on the die.

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:32]** Kill shot.

**[01:21:32 - 01:21:33]** And that is a 22.

**[01:21:33 - 01:21:38]** Thank you, Lozu, for not making Rick a murder bot.

**[01:21:38 - 01:21:40]** Well, let's see how much damage she does.

**[01:21:40 - 01:21:42]** Four points of damage.

**[01:21:42 - 01:21:54]** And Algiata looks like she is on her last legs as she hits the back of the crate and clutches at where Lozu shot.

**[01:21:54 - 01:21:57]** She is very close to death.

**[01:21:57 - 01:21:59]** Lozu did a surprising damage there.

**[01:22:00 - 01:22:02]** Rick, it is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:22:03 - 01:22:07]** This could be your moment when you embrace the murder bot side.

**[01:22:07 - 01:22:08]** Murder, murder, murder, murder.

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:09]** Do you do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:22:10 - 01:22:12]** No, I'm going to take a minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:22:12 - 01:22:13]** You're going to take a minus four.

**[01:22:13 - 01:22:15]** You're going to swing again.

**[01:22:15 - 01:22:19]** You pull the axe right off of the crate, and you swing again.

**[01:22:19 - 01:22:20]** That's a five.

**[01:22:21 - 01:22:22]** Yeah, that's not going to hit.

**[01:22:23 - 01:22:26]** When she got shot, you were already swinging, and it just missed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:22:27 - 01:22:32]** But I'm going to roll and intimidate to make her give up.

**[01:22:32 - 01:22:33]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:22:33 - 01:22:34]** What are you going to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:22:34 - 01:22:38]** I tell her, Yox, your crew is almost completely gone.

**[01:22:38 - 01:22:40]** Give up now, and you may live.

**[01:22:44 - 01:22:44]** 11.

**[01:22:44 - 01:22:46]** I think that's a plus three, though.

**[01:22:46 - 01:22:50]** So 11 plus intimidation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:22:50 - 01:22:51]** Intimidation.

**[01:22:51 - 01:22:51]** 14.

**[01:22:51 - 01:22:52]** 14.

**[01:22:52 - 01:22:53]** Okay.

**[01:22:53 - 01:22:58]** Her eyes widen as you say the words yachts, and she looks at you in surprise.

**[01:22:58 - 01:23:01]** You'll find out what she does in a minute.

**[01:23:01 - 01:23:03]** It is the top of round four.

**[01:23:03 - 01:23:07]** It would be Billy's turn, but he is dead.

**[01:23:07 - 01:23:07]** Departed.

**[01:23:08 - 01:23:09]** Departed.

**[01:23:09 - 01:23:10]** You know whose turn it is.

**[01:23:10 - 01:23:11]** Algiata.

**[01:23:11 - 01:23:12]** Retired.

**[01:23:12 - 01:23:12]** Officially retired.

**[01:23:12 - 01:23:13]** Officially retired.

**[01:23:13 - 01:23:15]** Billy is officially retired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:23:16 - 01:23:18]** Algiata.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:23:18 - 01:23:19]** I can picture it.

**[01:23:19 - 01:23:23]** She, like... The axe has come, like, right in front of her face.

**[01:23:23 - 01:23:24]** And then you say that.

**[01:23:26 - 01:23:30]** And she just peers over and looks at you with surprise.

**[01:23:31 - 01:23:33]** Clutching at where Lozu just shot her.

**[01:23:34 - 01:23:35]** And says...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:23:36 - 01:23:38]** Kill the android.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:23:38 - 01:23:43]** And then takes a guarded step back around the corner.

**[01:23:44 - 01:23:46]** Around the corner of the crate.

**[01:23:47 - 01:23:56]** And she used the get him move action for her ally.

**[01:23:56 - 01:23:58]** So she's an operative is what you're telling us?

**[01:23:59 - 01:24:01]** Yeah, I'm just going to make sure that there's not a roll for the get him.

**[01:24:01 - 01:24:02]** I think I can just do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:24:04 - 01:24:06]** You can just do it, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:24:06 - 01:24:06]** Yep.

**[01:24:07 - 01:24:09]** And she used get him against you.

**[01:24:10 - 01:24:13]** So her allies have a plus one bonus against you.

**[01:24:14 - 01:24:16]** Specifically because you said that.

**[01:24:17 - 01:24:18]** Nico, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:24:19 - 01:24:23]** Nico's going to start charging after and say, I don't think so.

**[01:24:23 - 01:24:26]** And he's going to charge this guy right here.

**[01:24:28 - 01:24:31]** And he's going to charge move.

**[01:24:31 - 01:24:34]** It's a bluff check.

**[01:24:34 - 01:24:35]** It's a trick attack.

**[01:24:35 - 01:24:37]** Because he's got a sword, too.

**[01:24:38 - 01:24:40]** Because charge is an actual... Yeah, charge is a thing.

**[01:24:41 - 01:24:42]** No, I'm not charging.

**[01:24:42 - 01:24:46]** Like, I'm just... It's looking like I'm charging, but I'm not charging.

**[01:24:47 - 01:24:48]** Okay.

**[01:24:48 - 01:24:50]** All right, and he's going to slash with the sword.

**[01:24:50 - 01:24:51]** Going to run up.

**[01:24:52 - 01:24:53]** Can you trick attack with a melee weapon?

**[01:24:53 - 01:24:55]** Yeah, that's the operative thing.

**[01:24:55 - 01:24:55]** Okay.

**[01:24:58 - 01:25:04]** So, my trick attack fails, but we'll see about the actual attack.


## Speaker_0

**[01:25:04 - 01:25:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:25:05 - 01:25:05]** Okay.

**[01:25:06 - 01:25:07]** It says melee or small arm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:25:08 - 01:25:09]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[01:25:09 - 01:25:10]** Yeah, that was totally my bad.

**[01:25:10 - 01:25:11]** Melee or small arm.

**[01:25:11 - 01:25:12]** What did you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:25:12 - 01:25:16]** That's a 15 on the sword attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:25:17 - 01:25:18]** That is a hit.

**[01:25:19 - 01:25:19]** Well done.

**[01:25:20 - 01:25:21]** Nice.

**[01:25:21 - 01:25:22]** Dueling sword hit.

**[01:25:22 - 01:25:23]** How much damage?

**[01:25:23 - 01:25:24]** Runner through.

**[01:25:24 - 01:25:27]** Seven points of damage.

**[01:25:27 - 01:25:28]** Get him as an envoy.

**[01:25:29 - 01:25:30]** Seven points of damage.

**[01:25:30 - 01:25:31]** Nicely done.

**[01:25:31 - 01:25:31]** Good hit.

**[01:25:32 - 01:25:33]** Good hit, sir.

**[01:25:34 - 01:25:35]** Well done.

**[01:25:36 - 01:25:37]** It is her turn.

**[01:25:38 - 01:25:42]** She has a pistol.

**[01:25:43 - 01:25:44]** Oh, how does she do this?

**[01:25:44 - 01:25:46]** How does she want to do this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:25:47 - 01:25:50]** I think she is loyal.

**[01:25:51 - 01:25:54]** She can't attack without a broken attack opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:25:54 - 01:25:56]** I think she's going to take the AOL.

**[01:25:56 - 01:25:57]** She's going to risk it.

**[01:25:57 - 01:25:58]** She don't care.

**[01:25:58 - 01:26:03]** She wants to take out Rick because Algiata was like, you need to take out Rick.

**[01:26:03 - 01:26:05]** So she's going to shoot at Rick.

**[01:26:05 - 01:26:09]** I think you get the AOL before I roll the attack.

**[01:26:09 - 01:26:10]** So give me your AOL, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:26:11 - 01:26:11]** Okay, okay.

**[01:26:16 - 01:26:17]** John's not going to like this.

**[01:26:17 - 01:26:20]** Did you get a one?

**[01:26:20 - 01:26:21]** No, I got a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:26:21 - 01:26:23]** Yeah, that is a hit.

**[01:26:23 - 01:26:24]** That is definitely a hit.

**[01:26:25 - 01:26:25]** That is a hit.

**[01:26:26 - 01:26:27]** How much damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:26:28 - 01:26:29]** She knew the risk going in.

**[01:26:30 - 01:26:33]** And get him as an envoy trick, not an operative.

**[01:26:33 - 01:26:35]** I always get operative and envoys mixed up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:26:35 - 01:26:37]** John, max damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:26:37 - 01:27:04]** eight points of damage nice wow oh she is bloody she was not expecting that she wasn't even looking die is just killing it for me tonight dude well done okay she's still alive but she but she doesn't even like flinch she doesn't even pay attention to you she just looks and points at rick and then gets hit rick how does a 27 do you why do you even ask

## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:27:06 - 01:27:08]** How are you rolling this high with these characters?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:27:08 - 01:27:14]** She rolled an 18, she gets a 19, and then she has plus 8, which is... Fake.

**[01:27:14 - 01:27:14]** 27.

**[01:27:14 - 01:27:16]** It's all not true.

**[01:27:16 - 01:27:16]** All right, Rick.

**[01:27:17 - 01:27:19]** Where are you at, hit points, stamina points-wise?

**[01:27:19 - 01:27:20]** You going to tell me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:27:20 - 01:27:21]** I'm fine.

**[01:27:21 - 01:27:22]** Okay.

**[01:27:22 - 01:27:23]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:27:23 - 01:27:23]** Cool.

**[01:27:23 - 01:27:24]** Well, you just took four more points of damage.

**[01:27:25 - 01:27:28]** So, from a shot, I don't know where you're at.

**[01:27:28 - 01:27:31]** My stamina is kind of, I think my stamina is getting a little low-ish.

**[01:27:31 - 01:27:31]** What is a little low?

**[01:27:32 - 01:27:33]** Are you bloodied, stamina-wise?

**[01:27:33 - 01:27:37]** Well, stamina wouldn't be bloodied, right?

**[01:27:37 - 01:27:39]** Are you below half health from stamina?

**[01:27:40 - 01:27:42]** I am below half my stamina.

**[01:27:42 - 01:27:42]** Got it.

**[01:27:42 - 01:27:42]** Yes.

**[01:27:43 - 01:27:43]** Okay.

**[01:27:44 - 01:27:44]** Good talk.

**[01:27:45 - 01:27:47]** Yeah, she wants to take you out.

**[01:27:48 - 01:27:50]** She wants to take you out.

**[01:27:50 - 01:27:51]** Here's what he's doing.

**[01:27:51 - 01:27:52]** It might happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:27:54 - 01:27:56]** Here's picks up the bag and looks inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:27:57 - 01:27:57]** Okay.

**[01:27:58 - 01:27:58]** All righty.

**[01:27:59 - 01:28:01]** So you pick up the bag.

**[01:28:01 - 01:28:05]** I will tell you immediately that you recognize the bag.

**[01:28:05 - 01:28:06]** Maybe you do.

**[01:28:06 - 01:28:07]** Maybe you don't.

**[01:28:07 - 01:28:12]** It's a Starfinder backpack, which is a specific type of backpack.

**[01:28:13 - 01:28:15]** You open it, and inside you find three things.

**[01:28:17 - 01:28:18]** An efficient bandolier.

**[01:28:19 - 01:28:21]** I'll put this all in the chat later.

**[01:28:21 - 01:28:21]** Hell yeah.

**[01:28:21 - 01:28:25]** An obsidian electrovore figurine of wondrous power.

**[01:28:26 - 01:28:28]** And a proximity helmet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:28:30 - 01:28:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:28:30 - 01:28:30]** Whoa.

**[01:28:32 - 01:28:51]** got interesting and i'm just telling that to you because it's like i don't want you to have to praise or wonder and it's like you just see what it is but i but i will say this the box that's the silvery smooth metal box so shiny doesn't look like it's been opened that's good

**[01:28:52 - 01:28:54]** Um, that's what you find.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:28:54 - 01:28:56]** Could you explain the second thing?

**[01:28:57 - 01:29:00]** I want to like understand what they are more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:29:00 - 01:29:04]** Uh, the obsidian electrophore figurine of wondrous power.

**[01:29:04 - 01:29:07]** It's a, it's a little figurines, a few inches tall.

**[01:29:08 - 01:29:14]** Basically when you throw it or use it, it becomes an electrophore, which is a type of creature that,

**[01:29:14 - 01:29:16]** It's a summoning device.

**[01:29:16 - 01:29:17]** That's awesome.

**[01:29:17 - 01:29:18]** It's pretty cool.

**[01:29:18 - 01:29:19]** I'm not going to lie.

**[01:29:20 - 01:29:28]** In general, part of the reason why I wanted to make sure that we talked about the ion tape and the zip stick is because there's some cool loot that you guys get.

**[01:29:28 - 01:29:33]** And I want to make sure that you get all of it because you have ion tape and you have this figurine.

**[01:29:33 - 01:29:33]** It's pretty dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:29:34 - 01:29:39]** We just have to be really careful because, like, you say these things and they just go right over our heads because we don't realize how cool these things are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:29:39 - 01:29:48]** I know, but that's why we talk about it off air, and then all the listeners can ask their GMs, or if they are a GM, they'll ask it for it in their game.

**[01:29:48 - 01:29:48]** It'll be great.

**[01:29:49 - 01:29:51]** Here, so what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:29:51 - 01:29:52]** Is that a one-time use thing?

**[01:29:54 - 01:29:54]** No.

**[01:29:56 - 01:29:57]** Can it be used forever?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:29:57 - 01:29:59]** I do not believe so.

**[01:30:00 - 01:30:05]** Each figurine can become a creature for up to one minute per day, though it doesn't need to be used continuously.


## Speaker_0

**[01:30:05 - 01:30:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:30:06 - 01:30:07]** but can I reuse it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:30:07 - 01:30:16]** oh I can reuse it over and over every 24 hours it's like once per day for up to a minute but you can like divvy up that minute


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:30:16 - 01:30:17]** That's ten rounds.

**[01:30:18 - 01:30:19]** You could divvy up that minute?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:30:19 - 01:30:20]** What do you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:30:20 - 01:30:27]** You could throw it out for two rounds, use a move action, dismiss it, and then you have another eight rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:30:27 - 01:30:28]** Six seconds at a time.

**[01:30:29 - 01:30:31]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:30:32 - 01:30:32]** That's pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:30:32 - 01:30:34]** Use it right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:30:34 - 01:30:34]** I know.

**[01:30:34 - 01:30:35]** That's what I'm doing.

**[01:30:36 - 01:30:46]** Here's just going to throw it out right next to, I suppose, this little crate area right next to Algiata and the other female pirate.

**[01:30:46 - 01:30:47]** Can you throw that far?

**[01:30:48 - 01:30:51]** Here we'll walk as far as he needs to, but I'm guessing here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:30:52 - 01:30:55]** No, because your move action, you can do technically two move actions.

**[01:30:55 - 01:30:57]** One move action is picking up and digging through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:30:58 - 01:30:59]** You might have to wait, man.

**[01:30:59 - 01:31:01]** You might have to wait, which is fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:31:01 - 01:31:02]** No, you can throw it.

**[01:31:02 - 01:31:06]** You just have to do the throw technique of 20 feet or whatever we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:31:06 - 01:31:08]** Yeah, and you just got to make sure that you are 20 feet.

**[01:31:09 - 01:31:10]** Where is 20 feet from where you are?

**[01:31:11 - 01:31:13]** That's like right behind Lozu and Nico.

**[01:31:13 - 01:31:14]** So I don't know that you want to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:31:14 - 01:31:15]** Yeah, perfect.

**[01:31:15 - 01:31:17]** Well, it's a creature that would fight for us.

**[01:31:17 - 01:31:17]** That's true.

**[01:31:17 - 01:31:18]** I'm assuming.

**[01:31:18 - 01:31:19]** And it could move around and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:31:19 - 01:31:20]** Oh, totally do it.

**[01:31:20 - 01:31:21]** This is going to be awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:31:21 - 01:31:22]** You want to do it?

**[01:31:22 - 01:31:24]** I'm just going to do it, yeah.

**[01:31:24 - 01:31:26]** You're going to throw it right behind Nico.

**[01:31:26 - 01:31:26]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:31:26 - 01:31:27]** Yeah, let's do that.

**[01:31:27 - 01:31:27]** Okay.

**[01:31:27 - 01:31:28]** This is an open spot, too.

**[01:31:28 - 01:31:30]** He just does that and says, heads up, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:31:31 - 01:31:31]** Get out of the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:31:35 - 01:31:36]** Okay.

**[01:31:36 - 01:31:36]** I love it.

**[01:31:37 - 01:31:38]** This is so dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:31:39 - 01:31:40]** Run in towards the slide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:31:41 - 01:31:45]** Oh, man, if you could throw it here and then I can flank, it would be fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:31:45 - 01:31:50]** So to throw an improvised weapon like that, because I think that's what you need to do, right?

**[01:31:53 - 01:31:53]** Is that what it is?

**[01:31:54 - 01:31:58]** I think to just roll to make sure that you get in that area.

**[01:31:58 - 01:32:00]** It's like AC5 to hit that square that you want to hit.

**[01:32:01 - 01:32:01]** That's what I'm thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:32:02 - 01:32:04]** And if you don't, then it just goes off in another direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:32:04 - 01:32:07]** Yeah, then we would randomly roll to see where it goes off in another direction.

**[01:32:08 - 01:32:09]** What am I rolling?

**[01:32:09 - 01:32:11]** You're rolling a...

**[01:32:11 - 01:32:16]** Yeah, you're rolling a ranged.

**[01:32:16 - 01:32:17]** Use your ranged attack bonus.

**[01:32:18 - 01:32:21]** You're basically just rolling to make sure that you don't get below a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:32:22 - 01:32:23]** I don't really know where that is.

**[01:32:23 - 01:32:25]** Oh, range attack bonus.

**[01:32:25 - 01:32:26]** Range attack is plus one.

**[01:32:26 - 01:32:26]** Okay, I'll roll that.

**[01:32:26 - 01:32:27]** Got it.

**[01:32:27 - 01:32:27]** See it.

**[01:32:28 - 01:32:29]** It's a three.

**[01:32:29 - 01:32:31]** You rolled a three?

**[01:32:32 - 01:32:32]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:32:32 - 01:32:33]** You missed.

**[01:32:33 - 01:32:36]** You did not do that.

**[01:32:36 - 01:32:36]** All right.

**[01:32:36 - 01:32:40]** I think this is, I'm pretty sure how that works.

**[01:32:40 - 01:32:42]** When you miss with a ranged weapon.

**[01:32:42 - 01:32:43]** Wow.

**[01:32:43 - 01:32:44]** This is going to be great.

**[01:32:44 - 01:32:46]** I am so excited this happened.

**[01:32:47 - 01:32:47]** Jeez.

**[01:32:48 - 01:32:48]** Yeah, you are.

**[01:32:48 - 01:32:49]** Missing with a throw.

**[01:32:50 - 01:32:50]** Yeah, I know.

**[01:32:50 - 01:32:53]** Roll a D8 because we're going to determine the initial misdirection.

**[01:32:54 - 01:32:56]** Determines where it rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:32:57 - 01:32:57]** I rolled a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:32:58 - 01:32:59]** You rolled a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:32:59 - 01:33:00]** Rolls to Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:33:00 - 01:33:05]** No, it rolls to the square right between them.

**[01:33:05 - 01:33:05]** Actually, closer.

**[01:33:05 - 01:33:06]** Right here.

**[01:33:06 - 01:33:08]** Oh, well, that's exactly where I want it to go.

**[01:33:09 - 01:33:11]** So it goes a little bit further.

**[01:33:11 - 01:33:12]** Amazing.

**[01:33:12 - 01:33:14]** You threw it and it went a little bit further right through them.

**[01:33:14 - 01:33:16]** And this small figurine...

**[01:33:18 - 01:33:24]** And this Electrovor electric creature spins out that I've just put in as a lightning ball right now on Roll20.

**[01:33:25 - 01:33:33]** And this creature spins out and the hair on Nico's arm stands up from the static.

**[01:33:33 - 01:33:40]** And Rick, maybe you feel a little jittery, Rick, as an android with all the static coming by.

**[01:33:40 - 01:33:41]** You're like, oh, this is a little weird.

**[01:33:42 - 01:33:42]** Well done.

**[01:33:43 - 01:33:44]** That was super cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:33:44 - 01:33:52]** And I'm going to just be like, can I do a life science check and, like, figure out what the fuck am I looking at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:33:52 - 01:33:53]** On your turn, yeah.

**[01:33:54 - 01:33:58]** Let's do it on your turn, which is right now, so that's fine.

**[01:33:59 - 01:33:59]** Yeah.

**[01:34:00 - 01:34:01]** I choose you.

**[01:34:01 - 01:34:01]** Yeah.

**[01:34:01 - 01:34:04]** You want to do a life science check, Dr. Okay?

**[01:34:04 - 01:34:04]** Is it his turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:34:04 - 01:34:05]** Yeah, identify a creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:34:06 - 01:34:06]** Yeah.

**[01:34:06 - 01:34:07]** I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:34:07 - 01:34:13]** Because I wouldn't have seen or heard or known anything about this beforehand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:34:13 - 01:34:14]** That is true.

**[01:34:15 - 01:34:18]** I'm looking up Electrovor right now.

**[01:34:19 - 01:34:22]** Dr. K, what did you get on your life science roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:34:22 - 01:34:25]** Sorry, I dropped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:34:25 - 01:34:26]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:34:26 - 01:34:27]** 15.

**[01:34:28 - 01:34:29]** I think that meets it.

**[01:34:29 - 01:34:30]** Let's see.

**[01:34:31 - 01:34:32]** That doesn't meet it.

**[01:34:32 - 01:34:34]** So you technically don't know what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:34:34 - 01:34:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:34:38 - 01:34:38]** I'm sorry.

**[01:34:38 - 01:34:39]** What value were you looking for?

**[01:34:40 - 01:34:40]** The CR.

**[01:34:42 - 01:34:43]** We're looking for the CR.

**[01:34:43 - 01:34:44]** It's two.

**[01:34:44 - 01:34:45]** CR two.

**[01:34:45 - 01:34:49]** Yeah, so I was thinking 15 plus one and a half times I could get your CR, so you didn't quite meet it.

**[01:34:49 - 01:34:51]** You were close, but not it.

**[01:34:52 - 01:34:53]** What are you doing, Dr. Okay?

**[01:34:53 - 01:34:56]** This weird electric creature pops up next to you.

**[01:34:56 - 01:34:56]** It's going to go on.

**[01:34:57 - 01:34:57]** Here's his next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:34:58 - 01:35:12]** So I'm going to move away as fast as possible from this thing and also try to cut off El Giotto's escape


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:35:12 - 01:35:12]** Okay.

**[01:35:13 - 01:35:16]** Yeah, you saw her move behind the crate in the northwest corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:35:17 - 01:35:22]** So I'm going to charge through my slime as fast as I can or as far as I can.

**[01:35:22 - 01:35:23]** Okay.

**[01:35:24 - 01:35:30]** Which I think will require me to... So this is 15.

**[01:35:30 - 01:35:31]** 15 to get to where?

**[01:35:31 - 01:35:36]** And then this is... Do I have to... Can I... I have to go around the corner, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:35:37 - 01:35:37]** Yeah.

**[01:35:37 - 01:35:37]** Yeah.

**[01:35:38 - 01:35:40]** So it's 15 up.

**[01:35:40 - 01:35:42]** If you hold Q, you can do a path and roll 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:35:44 - 01:35:44]** Oh, fancy.

**[01:35:44 - 01:35:45]** I didn't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:35:45 - 01:35:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:35:46 - 01:35:46]** Okay.

**[01:35:47 - 01:35:50]** And one of the squares is difficult terrain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:35:50 - 01:35:51]** Oh, wow.

**[01:35:51 - 01:35:51]** That is so cool.

**[01:35:51 - 01:35:52]** What happens if you want to do it twice?

**[01:35:52 - 01:35:53]** Oh, you just hit it over and over again.

**[01:35:54 - 01:35:54]** I love this.

**[01:35:54 - 01:35:55]** Yeah, look at that.

**[01:35:55 - 01:35:56]** What hockey is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:35:56 - 01:35:57]** It looks amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:35:57 - 01:36:02]** If you hit, just tap Q. If you drag, it hit Q, and then it drops a, like, waypoint.

**[01:36:02 - 01:36:03]** And then, yeah.

**[01:36:03 - 01:36:04]** That's awesome.

**[01:36:04 - 01:36:05]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:36:05 - 01:36:06]** How do you...

**[01:36:06 - 01:36:07]** Yeah.

**[01:36:07 - 01:36:09]** So I want to move there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:36:09 - 01:36:09]** Can you guys see mine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:36:10 - 01:36:13]** Yeah, that's kind of crazy, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:36:13 - 01:36:13]** All right, Kev.

**[01:36:13 - 01:36:14]** Chill out, Kev.

**[01:36:14 - 01:36:15]** You're doing a lot of things in here.

**[01:36:16 - 01:36:17]** All right, Dr. K. So where are you?

**[01:36:18 - 01:36:19]** Kelly, I just sent you a Slack message.

**[01:36:19 - 01:36:20]** Dr. K, where are you going?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:36:21 - 01:36:21]** Fuck.

**[01:36:21 - 01:36:24]** I'm trying to get to here, roughly.

**[01:36:25 - 01:36:25]** Okay.

**[01:36:25 - 01:36:28]** Yeah, I think that's fine.

**[01:36:28 - 01:36:30]** This is difficult terrain, though, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:36:31 - 01:36:33]** But I thought that you could move through it.

**[01:36:34 - 01:36:34]** You're fine?

**[01:36:34 - 01:36:34]** No?

**[01:36:35 - 01:36:35]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:36:36 - 01:36:37]** I feel like it's your slot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:36:37 - 01:36:38]** Yeah, it's your slot.

**[01:36:38 - 01:36:39]** I feel like you'd be fine moving through it.

**[01:36:39 - 01:36:40]** I'm just going to rule that you're fine moving through it.

**[01:36:41 - 01:36:41]** So where do you go?

**[01:36:42 - 01:36:42]** Dope.

**[01:36:42 - 01:36:43]** Yeah, dope.

**[01:36:43 - 01:36:44]** It makes sense.

**[01:36:44 - 01:36:45]** It's like your own slot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:36:45 - 01:36:47]** I just glide over it.

**[01:36:47 - 01:36:48]** Sorry.

**[01:36:48 - 01:36:49]** Excuse me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:36:50 - 01:36:50]** Okay.

**[01:36:52 - 01:36:52]** Yeah.

**[01:36:52 - 01:36:55]** I have my... Oh, I suppose I could shoot.

**[01:36:55 - 01:36:56]** You're going to... Yeah.

**[01:36:56 - 01:36:59]** You're going to move and then shoot at Algiato.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:37:01 - 01:37:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:37:01 - 01:37:02]** If you have your weapon out, yeah.

**[01:37:03 - 01:37:05]** If you had your caustic jet out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:37:07 - 01:37:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:37:07 - 01:37:11]** That is 15 on the die.

**[01:37:11 - 01:37:12]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:37:13 - 01:37:15]** 15 on the die.

**[01:37:15 - 01:37:17]** Impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:37:17 - 01:37:18]** Press 3 to hit to 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:37:19 - 01:37:20]** Yeah, that is a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:37:21 - 01:37:22]** All right.

**[01:37:22 - 01:37:23]** Die, Altina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:37:23 - 01:37:25]** Die, Yox.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:37:26 - 01:37:26]** Yox.

**[01:37:28 - 01:37:29]** Four total damage.

**[01:37:30 - 01:37:36]** With just a regular acid burn damage from the cost of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:37:36 - 01:37:38]** Regular acid burn damage.

**[01:37:39 - 01:37:40]** Okay.

**[01:37:41 - 01:37:43]** You shoot and you hit.

**[01:37:44 - 01:37:50]** And, Nico, you notice from behind the space pirate in front of you a look of surprise on Algie's face.

**[01:37:50 - 01:37:54]** As the bullet just hits her in the back.

**[01:37:55 - 01:38:00]** And then you see her fall to her knees as she dies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:38:00 - 01:38:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:38:02 - 01:38:04]** Well done.

**[01:38:04 - 01:38:05]** Nice.

**[01:38:05 - 01:38:07]** Well done.

**[01:38:08 - 01:38:08]** Wow.

**[01:38:09 - 01:38:12]** That is awesome.

**[01:38:12 - 01:38:13]** She is dead.

**[01:38:13 - 01:38:14]** There's one space pirate left.

**[01:38:14 - 01:38:21]** She looks back, sees her dead, and a look of fear comes across her face briefly.

**[01:38:21 - 01:38:24]** Well done, Dr. Okay.

**[01:38:24 - 01:38:27]** It is Lozu's turn.

**[01:38:28 - 01:38:37]** And Lozu is going to step mouth agape looking at this Electrovor that is just suddenly right in front of her.

**[01:38:38 - 01:38:44]** She is going to step over and she is going to shout at the pirate and say...

**[01:38:44 - 01:38:47]** You can still put down your gun if you want.

**[01:38:48 - 01:38:52]** And then she's going to level her gun at the pirate and not shoot.

**[01:38:52 - 01:38:53]** Rick, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:38:53 - 01:38:55]** What are you doing?

**[01:38:55 - 01:38:56]** Yep.

**[01:38:56 - 01:39:05]** Rick is going to step forward and hold his axe up and do the same thing.

**[01:39:05 - 01:39:08]** He's going to say, you are the last one standing from your crew.

**[01:39:09 - 01:39:12]** Stand down and live.

**[01:39:12 - 01:39:14]** and he's going to hold an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:39:14 - 01:39:14]** Okay.

**[01:39:15 - 01:39:15]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:39:16 - 01:39:17]** Well done.

**[01:39:18 - 01:39:20]** It is the top of round five.

**[01:39:20 - 01:39:21]** Nico, it's your turn.

**[01:39:21 - 01:39:24]** Both Billy and Algiata are dead.

**[01:39:25 - 01:39:26]** What are you doing, Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:39:26 - 01:39:28]** Nico's going to talk to the rest of the group.

**[01:39:28 - 01:39:31]** He's going to be like, oh, you guys are spoiled sports.

**[01:39:31 - 01:39:32]** All right.

**[01:39:32 - 01:39:34]** If you guys want him alive, well, I'm alive.

**[01:39:34 - 01:39:38]** But he looks at the pirate and says, but just so you know, I'd rather kill you right now.

**[01:39:38 - 01:39:40]** You attack me, you attack my friends.

**[01:39:40 - 01:39:43]** As far as I'm concerned, rules of engagement say I can kill you.

**[01:39:45 - 01:39:48]** And he's going to roll intimidation on that.

**[01:39:48 - 01:39:49]** Okay.

**[01:39:50 - 01:39:51]** Whose rules of engagement?

**[01:39:52 - 01:39:55]** So that's a 14 plus...

**[01:39:55 - 01:39:57]** 14 plus 8, 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:39:57 - 01:40:01]** 14 plus 8, 22.

**[01:40:01 - 01:40:03]** Real tough.

**[01:40:03 - 01:40:08]** 22.

**[01:40:10 - 01:40:13]** She looks back at...

**[01:40:14 - 01:40:15]** Looks at Rick.

**[01:40:15 - 01:40:16]** Looks at Lozu.

**[01:40:16 - 01:40:16]** Looks at Nico.

**[01:40:16 - 01:40:23]** Looks at this Electrovor that is just like... The static is coming out of its face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:40:24 - 01:40:29]** Looks like I would imagine some sort of like a dog-like creature made of electricity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:40:30 - 01:40:31]** Yeah, 100%.

**[01:40:31 - 01:40:31]** Yeah.

**[01:40:32 - 01:40:33]** Cackling.

**[01:40:33 - 01:40:39]** And the pirate drops her pistol and puts her hands behind her head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:40:39 - 01:40:42]** And she gives up.

**[01:40:43 - 01:40:45]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:40:46 - 01:40:59]** Nico and Rick, she gets down on her knees, puts her hands behind her head, and you see behind her the figure of Algiata has already begun to shift into what you know as an astrozoan.

**[01:41:00 - 01:41:05]** Here's, what do you do with the electrovore?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:41:06 - 01:41:06]** Yeah.

**[01:41:06 - 01:41:08]** Here's doesn't know how to do it, how to use it yet.

**[01:41:08 - 01:41:10]** So he'll just recall it for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:41:10 - 01:41:10]** Okay.

**[01:41:10 - 01:41:12]** So you dismiss it.

**[01:41:13 - 01:41:13]** Billy is dead.

**[01:41:14 - 01:41:25]** Space pirate is, it's given up Algiata or rather the astrozoan likely yaks is dead.

**[01:41:26 - 01:41:32]** Lozu walks over and bends down and just reaches out and touches Algiata's armor.

**[01:41:34 - 01:41:38]** You can tell she's sad at the loss of two of her crew.

**[01:41:40 - 01:41:41]** She doesn't know yet that Song is dead.

**[01:41:41 - 01:41:42]** I don't think you've told her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:41:44 - 01:41:45]** What do you guys do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:41:46 - 01:41:49]** Rick is going to cuff the pirate with his binders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:41:49 - 01:41:50]** Okay, you cuff the pirate.

**[01:41:50 - 01:41:51]** She doesn't say anything.

**[01:41:51 - 01:41:52]** She's quiet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:41:53 - 01:41:55]** Nico's going to sheathe his sword and put away his blaster.

**[01:41:56 - 01:41:57]** Okay.

**[01:41:58 - 01:42:10]** He's going to start walking around the room and just kind of an amazement that he survived another combat as thin as he is, as kind of tight as he is on his own personal resources and resolve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:42:10 - 01:42:10]** Yeah.

**[01:42:11 - 01:42:14]** Now that the combat's over, do you guys just want to quickly say how close to death you were?

**[01:42:15 - 01:42:17]** Because I don't think it was made clear.

**[01:42:17 - 01:42:22]** And I kept asking you, but for the listeners, it's not a small amount.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:42:22 - 01:42:23]** It's actually fine.

**[01:42:23 - 01:42:28]** My stamina was down five out of 16, but my hit points were never touched.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:42:28 - 01:42:29]** What about you, Nico?

**[01:42:30 - 01:42:34]** I had zero stamina, four points of health, and one resolve point.

**[01:42:35 - 01:42:35]** Whoa.

**[01:42:35 - 01:42:36]** Oh, my God.

**[01:42:37 - 01:42:38]** And I was playing reckless, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:42:38 - 01:42:40]** Four points of stamina and one resolve?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:42:42 - 01:42:49]** At the start of the battle, I had four points of resolve and eight points of health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:42:49 - 01:42:51]** Do you have a backup character ready?

**[01:42:51 - 01:42:52]** Because you're going to need it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:42:54 - 01:42:59]** No, now I have six points of health and zero stamina and one resolve point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:43:00 - 01:43:00]** That's crazy.

**[01:43:01 - 01:43:02]** That's close.

**[01:43:02 - 01:43:03]** That is crazy.

**[01:43:04 - 01:43:11]** Here's has a 5 out of 12 stamina, 14 out of 16 hit points, and 2 out of 5 resolve.

**[01:43:11 - 01:43:12]** So he's okay.

**[01:43:12 - 01:43:15]** 2 out of 5 resolve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:43:15 - 01:43:16]** Okay.

**[01:43:16 - 01:43:16]** Okay.

**[01:43:16 - 01:43:16]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:43:16 - 01:43:17]** Dr. Okay?

**[01:43:17 - 01:43:24]** Dr. Okay's 7 out of 12 stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:43:25 - 01:43:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:43:25 - 01:43:27]** Full hit points, full resolve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:43:27 - 01:43:27]** Wow.

**[01:43:27 - 01:43:27]** Okay.

**[01:43:27 - 01:43:29]** So maybe not as bad as I thought.

**[01:43:29 - 01:43:30]** But Nico for sure.

**[01:43:31 - 01:43:32]** Could have been worse.

**[01:43:32 - 01:43:33]** You all played it smart.

**[01:43:34 - 01:43:35]** They tried to play it smart, but you guys played it smarter.

**[01:43:35 - 01:43:36]** It's all good.

**[01:43:37 - 01:43:38]** So here's walking around the room.

**[01:43:40 - 01:43:41]** Rick, Dr.

**[01:43:41 - 01:43:43]** O.K., what are you all doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:43:44 - 01:43:49]** Well, besides looting the place, Rick definitely wants to check the airlocks.

**[01:43:49 - 01:43:51]** Check the what?

**[01:43:51 - 01:43:52]** Do a perception check.

**[01:43:52 - 01:43:52]** The silver box?

**[01:43:52 - 01:43:52]** The airlock.

**[01:43:53 - 01:43:55]** Oh, the airlock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:43:55 - 01:43:59]** The airlock, the silver box, Algeata...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:43:59 - 01:44:00]** Well, let's take this one at a time.

**[01:44:01 - 01:44:02]** Let's not just gloss all over it.

**[01:44:03 - 01:44:06]** So, you guys are just going through all of it, right?

**[01:44:08 - 01:44:08]** Yeah.

**[01:44:08 - 01:44:25]** So, you quickly realize that other than the trinkets and the mass-produced goods that are there, you realize that here's all the important things were in that Starfinder book bag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:44:25 - 01:44:27]** Is there like any identification on the bag?

**[01:44:28 - 01:44:28]** Like,

**[01:44:28 - 01:44:31]** It's a Starfinder bag, but is there a name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:44:31 - 01:44:35]** No, it is a literal Starfinder book bag.

**[01:44:36 - 01:44:43]** Um, it has something where when you put stuff in it and wear it, you get a plus or a bonus to like your encumbrance.

**[01:44:43 - 01:44:46]** It makes things a lot easier to carry that are not as heavy.

**[01:44:46 - 01:44:46]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:44:46 - 01:44:47]** That's my question though.

**[01:44:47 - 01:44:49]** Like it's, it's a Starfinders book bag.

**[01:44:49 - 01:44:50]** Yes.

**[01:44:50 - 01:44:52]** It's not like you just buy a book bag that says Starfinder.

**[01:44:52 - 01:44:53]** No, it's a Starfinders book bag.

**[01:44:54 - 01:44:57]** So is, is there like, is there a name associated with this?

**[01:44:57 - 01:45:00]** Like, do we know what Starfinder, like, is there a dead Starfinder somewhere?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:45:00 - 01:45:02]** No, it's just a Starfinder book bag.

**[01:45:02 - 01:45:04]** Just has the Starfinder sign on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:45:04 - 01:45:07]** Well, I'll take the book bag if that's the case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:45:08 - 01:45:10]** I would also enjoy that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:45:11 - 01:45:12]** Let's roll off on it in a bit.

**[01:45:13 - 01:45:19]** So you realize that all the goods were what Hears found that were in that book bag.

**[01:45:19 - 01:45:25]** And when you think about it with the amount of time that you guys took going through...

**[01:45:25 - 01:45:50]** yaks algiata definitely had time to go through and look through everything clearly that's what they were doing with all the goods that are spilled out across the room right who is going to look at the silvery box oh by the way you go into the airlock you look over it just looks like a normal airlock you don't see anything in there okay um with with the silver box i think uh we should take it back to dr benjamin


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:45:51 - 01:45:54]** Is it connected to anything or can we carry it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:45:54 - 01:45:55]** Isn't it huge as hell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:45:56 - 01:45:57]** No, it's not that huge.

**[01:45:57 - 01:45:59]** It's kind of small.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:46:00 - 01:46:01]** It's got astrolytes in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:46:02 - 01:46:03]** It doesn't have astrolytes in it.

**[01:46:04 - 01:46:06]** So no one's going to try and open it?

**[01:46:07 - 01:46:08]** Well, it's got biometrics on it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:46:08 - 01:46:11]** I'm assuming that those biometrics are Dr. Benjamin's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:46:11 - 01:46:12]** Yeah, but you could break in if you want.

**[01:46:14 - 01:46:14]** Oh.

**[01:46:15 - 01:46:17]** Well, it's a lock just like anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:46:18 - 01:46:19]** I think we should be cautious.

**[01:46:20 - 01:46:22]** I don't want some other weird thing popping out of it.

**[01:46:23 - 01:46:24]** We're all kind of weathered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:46:24 - 01:46:26]** I don't think we should leave it here.

**[01:46:26 - 01:46:27]** No, we're going to take it.

**[01:46:27 - 01:46:27]** I think we should take it with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:46:27 - 01:46:30]** And then we can ask him about it and then open it, I think.

**[01:46:31 - 01:46:31]** Yes, I agree.

**[01:46:31 - 01:46:34]** If he doesn't, yeah.

**[01:46:34 - 01:46:35]** We won't give it to him.

**[01:46:35 - 01:46:37]** We'll keep it, but we'll ask him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:46:37 - 01:46:42]** Do we need to get control of the ship or ascertain where these pirates came from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:46:42 - 01:46:43]** Well, I'll say this.

**[01:46:43 - 01:46:53]** Here's as you were near it and you're starting to grab the book bag and walking over to the silvery box and everything.

**[01:46:55 - 01:46:59]** Something catches your eye and you take a few steps forward.

**[01:46:59 - 01:47:03]** Something catches your eye and you take a few steps back and then there's nothing.

**[01:47:04 - 01:47:07]** And then you walk forward again, and you see it, and you realize what it is.

**[01:47:07 - 01:47:14]** And you look down, and you didn't... Maybe in the heat of combat, you just didn't notice it.

**[01:47:14 - 01:47:15]** It was weird.

**[01:47:16 - 01:47:19]** But the closer that you get to the box...

**[01:47:21 - 01:47:32]** The blue object that was given to you by Rolu in episode one grows brighter and brighter the closer that you get to the box.

**[01:47:32 - 01:47:32]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:47:35 - 01:47:35]** What?

**[01:47:35 - 01:47:40]** This could be it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:47:40 - 01:47:40]** Excited.

**[01:47:40 - 01:47:41]** How?

**[01:47:42 - 01:47:42]** What?

**[01:47:43 - 01:47:44]** Redemption will come to hears.


## Speaker_0

**[01:47:45 - 01:47:45]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:48:11 - 01:48:12]** Station.
