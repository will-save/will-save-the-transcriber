## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:09]** Last time, on We'll Save, our band of adventurers began a search for clues regarding the strange happenings onboard the Chimera.

**[00:00:10 - 00:00:19]** While Hears and Nico inspected the remains of the incapacitator droid, Rick19 and Dr. OK began questioning Trost's neck.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:25]** Trostenek did his best to answer the duo's questions, however, Rick-19 remained unconvinced.

**[00:00:26 - 00:00:32]** Rick-19 incarcerated Trostenek and contacted first mate Lozu for further instructions.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:35]** Lozu told the group to stay put and wait for her.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:42]** The group waited and waited, but she never came, and the group found her in the hallway staring off into space.

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:45]** Why are you so lost in space, Lozu?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:39]** Hey, everyone.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:41]** It's just me, John Swan.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:50]** And I just wanted to tell you personally that we want to thank you so much for making our launch and the first 10 episodes so awesome.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:54]** And what better way to thank you than with a sweepstakes?

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:59]** So after the episode, check out my outro to find out more.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:01]** Until then, let's play.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:08]** You know what's a crucial component of RPGs?

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:14]** Like, the most crucial, the only way...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:38]** the roll the dice story be damned it's the choices choices i don't think that's what role play stands for you know yeah i was like the role like r-o-l-e i don't think john is asking about like the anagram i think he's asking what makes a role-playing game a role-playing game


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** No, he's talking about dice.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** I'm talking about dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Just for our listeners.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:45]** That's a tabletop RPG requirement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:48]** John RGM is a dice goblin.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** If you don't know what that is, I'm afraid to tell you to Google it.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** It might show up bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** Do you want to see all my dice?

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:56]** Can you see this?

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:59 - 00:02:59]** It's a lot.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** Google Dice Goblin.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** You'll know exactly what we're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** You'll see exactly what we're talking about.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:10]** But most importantly, for those who might not have played Starfinder yet, and if you haven't, what are you waiting for?

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:10]** Play it.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** It's so fun.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:15]** But if this is your introduction, we're happy to be your introduction.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:20]** And if not, and if you're thinking about playing it, if you've played it before, you'll know what this is all about.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:20]** The D20.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:24]** The 20-sided die.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:27]** The staple of the TTRPG.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:34]** I just have to say that in tabletop games, you have good dice and you have bad dice.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** And the Threefold Conspiracy dice.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** Who makes these dice, Kev?

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** The Adventure Path dice?

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:41]** Q Workshop.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:42]** Q Workshop.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** These dice are phenomenal.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:48]** This D20 has been the crit giver, which is beautiful.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** It's been great.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:51]** It's been a wonderful time.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:54]** And I only hope that your D20s never do that.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** That's what I absolutely hope for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** Dr. OK likes to unleash the Kraken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** Oh, yeah, because you have Kraken die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** Cue Liam Neeson.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** Cue Liam Neeson.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:10]** In a world where Liam Neeson saves the world from a Kraken.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** What was that movie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:11]** Clash of Titans.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:13]** The Titans, yeah.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** The remake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Don't even watch that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** Don't watch it.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** Yeah, so let's get back to the matter at hand.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Q Workshop, Kraken Dice.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** What are some other ones that we love or that we have?

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:26]** Norse Foundry.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:27]** It's great.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** Raven and Riddle.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** There are a lot of great dice makers out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** Well, you're the dice goblin, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:37]** I know a lot, but I want to know what you guys are working with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** I've got, like, three sets of dice.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** I stick to what I... You're crazy.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** I'll be honest.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:49]** I just Googled, like, dice on Amazon and bought, like, the five different sets for, like, six bucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** For, like, $20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** No, like, even less than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:54]** That's great, though.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:54]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** Just generic dice.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:59]** I'm surprised they had all the numbers on them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:04]** John's always sending me links to unfinished dice, limited quantity.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:06]** The raw dice are great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:08]** Solid gold dice that cost $600.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** I would not do that.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** I do have that big pounder from Kraken.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** It's a pound D20.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:16]** Nick, what kind of dice are you rolling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:17]** Let's see here.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:21]** Looks like blue, gray, and splotches.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:25]** And it is absolutely interesting to watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** Is that your only set?

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** Oh, no, you have two, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** I have three sets, technically.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:31]** I have the blue and green ones.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:36]** Both, by the way, were bought at this really cool...

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** Was it Relics and Rarities, that one we went to live?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:44]** Yeah, it wasn't the show live, but it was the same GM, Debra Ann Wall, who's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:48]** By the way, that place is just down the street from where I work, like literally within walking distance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** Oh, cool.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** Oh, the Alex Theater, the Alexander Theater?

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:52]** Yeah.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** That's a great theater.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** It's an awesome, yeah.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:57]** And then I have the Orange Dice from Malcolm's Game.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:58]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:00]** From Gentleman Game Master.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** Shout out to Malcolm.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** Shout out.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** He is phenomenal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** Find his Instagram.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** He puts his stories up.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** What's his handle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** I'll get to you on that.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** You can play in his game.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** He's a great friend of the pod.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:12]** Good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** What's his handle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** Gentleman underscore Game Master.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** Master GM DM.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** Plays a lot of cool games.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:23]** Kelly, I called you out and then we kept talking.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:23]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:23]** It's fine.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** I cut you off.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:51]** i use virtual device dice and always have when we haven't met in person however i do have an unopened set of very basic uh dice which i probably will get into at some point a gift from a friend but i use a hero lab is it like here's a question this is how you know like like good quote unquote good dice versus like like other dice is whether or not they come in a box or like a container or if they're just in a plastic bag sealed in a plastic bag okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:54]** Hey, you know, that could be the award-winning D20.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:57]** Dice Goblin's got an opinion on this.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** Hey, you know, it could be good.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:01]** It could be good.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:02]** All dice are good.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:03]** I swear.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:04]** Well, okay.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:11]** So let's just lay it out for folks who have never had the pleasure of rolling a D20 or dice like this.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** So there's a 20-sided die.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** There's a 10-sided die.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:17]** There's another 10-sided die that's part of what's called the D100.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:20]** We'll get into that in a minute because I think Will's got some thoughts on that.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:27]** And then there's an 8-sided die, a 6-sided die, like you're used to seeing, and a 4-sided die that looks like a pyramid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** There's also a D3.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** They exist.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:29]** There's a D3.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** They exist.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:39]** Yeah, but see, the thing is that when you're rolling D100s, you have to roll two D10s, and the way that you do it, we'll get into it sometime when we're playing, but it's pretty unique.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:41]** There are also D100s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** Yeah, and I think Will really wants one.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** He told me earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** They are so ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:47]** I do want one, but I also want...

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:56]** I don't want to detract too much from star finder because there, there are other games that roll a D 100 more often.

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:02]** And so I just think that the D 100 needs to, you know, have some like shine.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:02]** Right.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:11]** Cause like the, the D 20 is like the one that, you know, like these giant cracking ones, it's like the feature die.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:11]** Yeah.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:15]** There's no feature D 100 out there that you can purchase.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** So dice makers get on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:26]** The D100s that are out, there are so many faces because there's 100 faces on it that they're practically just like a circle.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** Yeah.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:34]** If you want to get mathematical about it, a circle is just a polygon with infinite number of sides.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:41]** I'm not suggesting that we necessarily have to have D100s just as one die be shined up.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:43]** I just mean like...

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:45]** I want a D10 that looks awesome, okay?

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** And that's like a mountain to hold in my hand.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** That's what I want.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** It breaks the table when you roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** I do have one other die set that my cousin gave me.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** That was my first ever die set.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** Thank you very much, Matthew.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** Shout out to Matthew.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** An Elven, Glow in the Dark Elven one.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:04]** Also from, I believe, Q Workshop.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:07]** Q Workshop's got some phenomenal looking dice.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:10]** 100%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:19]** All right, is there anything else you guys want to throw out about DICE before we jump into the rather uneventful scene that happened, that unfolded last week?

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:19]** Are you kidding me?

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:21]** Nothing happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:23]** Are we going to discuss the scene?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** That's the question at the hour.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** Top of the hour here.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:33]** Last time after you were attacked by an incapacitator robot...

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:42]** Then revived questioned the owner of the robot, deemed them suspicious and a suspect, and then detained them.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:45]** You talk to the incapacitated robot.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Shout out to Nico.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** Trying to see what you can get from it.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** You took the control module.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** Here's Nico.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** You guys were doing that.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:58]** Then you call to the bridge asking for someone to come down.

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:01]** First mate responds, she's going to come down.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** You wait a little bit.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** She doesn't show up.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** You call back.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** They're like, yeah, she left.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** She should be on her way.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** You walk out.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:12]** And in the emergency lighting, you see a figure at the other end of the hall.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** And you kind of look.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** You can make it out.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:21]** You're like, oh, that's Lozu.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:30]** But there's just something off because she is staring at the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** This feels like a, what's that movie, Us?

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:39]** The movie Us, where like, I don't know if you watched it, but towards the end of the movie, they're like in the basement area or whatever.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:45]** And like, it just feels like that, like shining red lights, dark, weird things going on.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:48]** Like this is going to get out of hand real fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:51]** A very cool movie about Jungian ideas, by the way.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** It's really cool.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:53]** In a certain sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** She's staring at the wall, unflinching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** What do you all do?

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:09]** So Lozu is staring at the wall where we are, like ahead, dead ahead, at the end of the hall.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:09]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** No, like down here.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** You can see her on the screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** Right, right.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** Where is she looking?

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** At the wall.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** She must be looking here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:21]** Is she looking towards us or is she looking at a wall?

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:21]** Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** No, she's like kind of 45 degrees looking at the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:27]** This way or this way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:30]** Draw an arrow of which way she's facing, Jon.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** So we can better describe it to our listeners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** So she's looking like...

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:39]** 45 degrees towards the wall.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** The hell?

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:40]** Here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:49]** So, like, she turned down, because there's, okay, so it's a long corridor, and then there's a 45 degree hallway that connects to another hallway.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:55]** So she was walking in that hallway and then stops at the end of that 45 degree and then is staring straight ahead?

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:56]** Yes.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:57]** Okay.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** But not straight ahead towards you.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:02]** No, no, like straight from the 45 degree hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** Yes, at the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:08]** Uh, so Rick, Rick puts his hand up to kind of like halt everybody.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** He puts like his fist up.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:13]** He's going to look back and like caution them and wave his hand forward.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:16]** And then he's going to step forward with his gun up and ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:25]** Is going to ready his tactical syringe thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:47]** nico's gonna pull put one gun in back in his holster and he's gonna sneak up and he's gonna put a hand on rick's shoulder back shoulder and he's gonna say hold on we might yet have something to learn here and he looks back at dr okay and he says dr okay you got a sedative back there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:51]** Uh, no, technically.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:58]** But, uh, I can inhibit many of the creature's defenses.

**[00:12:59 - 00:12:59]** Kiers, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** This creature is the lieutenant.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** I'm more concerned about her.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** I don't think she's a suspect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** I could also boost her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:11]** It's not, it's, I want to see what's going on with her, if she's even responsive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:18]** I haven't ruled anyone out of anything, except you three, since I've been with you most of the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** So, all right.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** I still think these two are suspicious.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:24]** I'm going to go up there.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** I'm going to try and talk to her.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** If you guys see anything suspicious.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** Rick is moving forward.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** Yeah, let's all go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:34]** Well, Rick is going to stop around this door unless you're going to charge past him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** Nico's going to go all the way up.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:40]** He's just going to go up stealthily a little bit.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** So I'll roll stealth.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** Stealthily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:47]** Here's going to roll stealth to look around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:47 - 00:14:10]** rick rick just stops yeah i was gonna call out to her but nick is just charging ahead so okay so nico you start to walk up what was your stealth roll that's a 16 on the die plus six that's a 22 uh i rolled 17 stealth 22 stealth 17 from here's to peek around the corner right to like dr okay rolled a two

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:16]** I didn't know that you were rolling a stealth check, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:18]** My stealth check was a three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** Rick has stopped by this door.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:22]** I rolled a, sorry, I got to do short math.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:24]** What's 17 plus four?

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:24]** 21.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:28]** I got a 21 for perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** Okay.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:31]** She seems perfectly still.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:41]** Nico, as you walk past, Rick, maybe you don't even notice that Nico, just in the lighting, you were like trying to look, you were looking around the hall.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:45]** And then you look and see Nico is standing right up next to Lozu.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:53]** And Nico, as you step up, she kind of blinks her eyes, stabs you in the throat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** Hey.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:54]** Wow, Kev.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:55]** That was unnecessary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** Oh, hey.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Hey.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Hey, Nico.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** Hey.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** How are you doing?

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** I don't know what happened there.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** Just kind of dozed off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** Kind of blanked off for a minute.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** Nico's going to look back at her.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:13]** He's going to be like, are you sure you're all right?

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:17]** You were staring off into the void for what seemed like forever.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:23]** I was just getting ready to wave a hand in front of your face just to see if, well, Absalom to...

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Absalom the first mate here.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:26]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:31]** So as they're doing that, Rick starts approaching, and he's going to basically clear that hallway.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** He's just turning, like, gun ready, right behind.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** Nothing else in the hallway.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:37]** Just in case something happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:44]** Yeah, you guys were on a more zoomed in map, but when we kind of jumped to the larger map, there's nothing else in the hallway that you can see.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:46]** I think I'm fine.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:50]** I think I just kind of blanked off for a moment there.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** Is everything okay?

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** You've got your gun out.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:58]** Actually, Rick, you've got your gun out too.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** Is everything okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** No, Lieutenant Loza.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:03]** I informed you of this earlier.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:06]** There is a major issue going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Oh, okay.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:11]** Sorry, you're carrying weapons in the hallway.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** For passengers, it's just a little alarming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:23]** It's a little alarming to be without power in a ship where people are being attacked, wouldn't you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:25]** I absolutely understand.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** Again, I have apologized.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** Keeve is working.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:34]** They are doing their best to work, to restore power, to fix things.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:38]** Look, I do need to talk to you.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:44]** I think before maybe, Rick, you were asking me some questions.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:48]** I think maybe you had asked me about Trostenec, perhaps.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** Look, I...

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** I'm concerned.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:51]** I'm very busy.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:56]** I'm trying to figure this out and keep the ship running and check the systems and help out.

**[00:16:56 - 00:17:04]** But I didn't expect all of you to go attack people and detain them.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** Correction.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** We were attacked.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** We were only defending ourselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:08]** Yes.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** Okay.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** I was defending myself.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:18]** Sorry, you'd be picking up my slug body from the ground if it weren't for my actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:21]** Look, I am happy that you all are okay.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** Don't misunderstand that.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:31]** But I do recall that you all were going to go and you've detained a fellow passenger.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:34]** Look, I'm sure that you had your reasons.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:34]** That's okay.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:35]** I understand.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:39]** I'm glad that you're okay, but...

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:42]** I did just ask you to tell me if you knew anything about Algeata.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:53]** I appreciate you pointing me to somebody that may be a suspect, but I... Lieutenant Lozu, where is the security officer currently?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:56]** I don't know where she is.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:56]** Exactly.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** That is our issue.

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:59]** There is something going on.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:02]** I have tried to inform you of this on several occasions now.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:08]** We were attacked by that incapacitated robot, and there is now a suspect contained inside a box inside.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:15]** Before you start giving me any kind of lip about that, there is something going on in this ship, and we are going to investigate it, if only for our own safety.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:17]** Rick, Rick, Rick, hold on a second.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:18]** Hold on.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:23]** And Nico's just going to wave out to everybody just to kind of calm down, calm down.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** And he's going to say, First Mate Lozu.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** Yes.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:44]** If we could help you provide additional security in a time of ambiguous secureness, wouldn't that behoove every single passenger here and yourself to comply?

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:46]** Wouldn't you do that?

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:50]** And I'll roll a diplomacy check.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** Okay, good.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** On my diplomacy, that's going to be a 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** 24.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:14]** Look, I'm concerned about my fellow crewmate, and I am concerned about you all, and I absolutely don't want to see you get hurt.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:25]** I can't imagine any reason why someone may want to hurt her, and I appreciate your opportunity to help.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:32]** But if you are going to help, I will be honest, between me and the four of you, I

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** I'm busy.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** Keeve is busy.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** The captain is busy.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:39]** We're all busy.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** And now we're also trying to make sure that you're okay.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** And it's just a lot of pressure.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:47]** And I am trying to be the best first mate that I can.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:59]** And if you all are going to help, just please try and use your discretion in attacking passengers there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:19]** just correction defending ourselves okay i if you continue to insist that we are reckless attackers in this i'm going to have a serious problem with you hold on hold on hold on she's giving us permission guys let's just hold on she's accusing us

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:25]** I was just accused of carrying out nefarious acts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:25]** I want to say this.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** Let me correct my language.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:30]** I was the one that informed you of the situation.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:33]** Believe me, if we were being malicious, we would not have let you know.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:36]** I am informing you because you are the authority on this ship.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:41]** If you refuse to accept my answers, then I will go off on my own and figure this out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:54]** Nico, Nico is going to look over at Rick and he's going to roll a diplomacy check, but he's going to say he's going to be saying to Rick, Rick, we might just be going to investigate our own anyway.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** Accusations may not matter.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:58]** Hold on.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** Let's hear what she has to say.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:02]** And I'll roll diplomacy on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** Here's is going to roll sense motive as well.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** On Lozu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** Rick has no sense motive, so he'll try it.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** Oh, natural 20.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** I got a 19 on sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** Okay.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** I got a nine.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** So that's going to be what?

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** 17, six.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** That's going to be a 23 for me.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** You got a what, Here's?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** I just got a nine, so go with theirs.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:27]** Okay.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:32]** So you all are rolling sense motive on Lozu?

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:34]** Yes.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** On Lozu.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:35]** Yes.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:37]** Okay.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** She seems nervous.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:41]** Not because she's trying to hide anything.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:42]** Yeah.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:49]** She seems nervous because it seems like she is under a lot of pressure.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:56]** Look, I am really, like, the more she talks, the more her language, this, like, stutter starts to build up.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:01]** Look, what I'm trying to just say is that you have to understand that there are protocols on the ship.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:04]** I'm happy, and I appreciate you letting me know.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:06]** I am happy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:15]** Just please... Tell us about the protocols that allow the droid to attack us and space lies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** And some giant lice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:19]** There's no protocol for any of that.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** I apologize.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:24]** But you have to understand that just thank you for looping me in.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:31]** Thank you for letting me know about, about, about, about, about, about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** First mate, I think we have an understanding.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** About Trostenec.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** We understand where you're coming from.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:48]** We're going to go about our business, and we will assume full liability for our actions in both defending ourselves and making sure the rest of the passengers on this ship are safe.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:51]** We will chime in if there is something suspicions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:55]** Including those that are locked in crates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:58]** And Nico's going to look back over his shoulder at Dr.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:00]** O.K., just like, yo, cool it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:02]** Look, I appreciate it.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** Just why don't we do this?

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** If you can help, please, please, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:11]** Would you like us to escort you to the detained person and have this conversation with him?

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:14]** We did not detain him just for any reasons.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** We detained him because he was suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:18]** Please, just let me finish.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** I'm trying to finish here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:25]** I think you should be locked in his quarters if you're going to insist on taking him out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:29]** Please, just let me finish.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:33]** She's like nervous, but now like a little flustered.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** You guys are really talking at her.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:41]** I am going to handle it and take him to his corners.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** All right, say what you want to say.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** What exactly?

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** She pulls a gun and shoots all of you.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** She shoots all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:58]** Nika at this point just shakes his head and he is literally just going to take a couple steps back behind here.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** He's done.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** He's fucking done.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:02]** He's done everything he can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** Why don't we do this?

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** If you would like to help...

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:13]** Why don't I tell you what I think might be helpful?

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:19]** I believe it was you, Nico, who had suggested how you might be a best help.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:28]** Why don't we move forward and I will give you some suggestions for what would be helpful for me and for the ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:34]** Nico turns back around and Nico said, here would be my suggestions.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:35]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:40]** Let me tell you my suggestions for what I think would be helpful.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:42]** If you insist.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:49]** I will handle making sure that Trostenec is taken to his quarters.

**[00:24:49 - 00:25:11]** and likely detained I would appreciate it if you could either go help Keeve see what they need with helping with the engines and if you really want to be helpful as well I

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:13]** And she kind of has this fatigued look.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:20]** You could go tell me what you see in Algiada's room.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** And she hands you.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** A key card.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Nico.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:30]** So, Nico, I'm entrusting you with this key.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:39]** Look, the four of you, you have to try to understand from my position, I appreciate your help.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:42]** I don't want you to feel like I'm trying to tell you not.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:46]** Just please know that it is a lot to have passengers...

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:56]** detaining other passengers, just please try and make sure that you are very sure when you make those kind of calls.

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:00]** Is that something that you all can respect?

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:07]** And you can tell she's like, she half believes in herself and she's half just like faking it until you make it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:12]** And Nico will look back at the first mate and say,

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** You can trust us.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:17]** And he gives her a little bit of a wink with a smile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** Roll diplomacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** Thank you.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:26]** Here, I'll let Keeve know I will handle Trostenec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** That's a 19 on that diplomacy check, by the way.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** I actually did one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:36]** Yeah, she definitely feels like, Nico, you're the friendliest of the bunch.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** So she pulls out her recorder.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:42]** She starts to kind of walk a little bit towards the door more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:49]** Rick tells her before she goes, like, are you sure you want to go in there alone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:54]** I, I think I'll, I think I'm, I'm, I'm fine to deal with it.

**[00:26:54 - 00:27:00]** And you can tell, even though she was a little nervous before she's like, she's kind of just like, all right, I made my decision.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** I'm just going to go do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:07]** I wanted to ask her if there's any reason for that.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:10]** She might know for algae out to disappear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:14]** Um, here, one sec.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:19]** Let me just tell Keith that, that, that, do you mind if I tell them that, that, that they can expect your help?

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** You can tell, you can tell them whatever you like.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:27]** We may drop by her quarters beforehand, but.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:27]** That's fine.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:29]** Again, this stays between us.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:32]** I'm, I'm enlisting your help and I appreciate it.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:37]** So she brings it up and, you know, it's like, and then you hear Keith's voice.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Oh, hi, Lozu, honey.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:39]** Hi.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:39]** Hi.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** How are you?

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:44]** And then she quickly is like, yes, so I'm here with the passengers.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:48]** I think Rick and here's a doctor.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:48]** OK.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:53]** And Nico and they have volunteered to come help you out with some of the repairs.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** Oh, oh, yeah.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:55]** OK.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:56]** Thanks.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** Thank you.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:57]** Yes.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:57]** Yes.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** Thank you all.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** Thank you.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** Says like very loudly.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** Thank you all.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:01]** Yes.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** Thank you.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:02]** All right.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:02]** All right.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:03]** All right.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** And she says goodbye.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:10]** Sorry, Dr. O'Keefe, I think you had a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:35]** Yes, I was wondering if you might have any ideas as to the meeting or anyone who might benefit or possibly even a reason for our security officer's disappearance at this juncture in the same time as an engineering malfunction.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:40]** Does anyone have anything?

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:47]** Is there part of the crew or anything that we should maybe be aware of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** Well, um,

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** You can tell she's like a little nervous.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** She flushes a little bit.

**[00:28:53 - 00:29:08]** You don't know if it's Nico being helpful or the fact that you guys have agreed and she feels like there's a little bit of a weight listed off of her shoulder because you've helped to, you've, you know, you've agreed to help Keeve and help look for Algiata, figure out what happened.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:12]** She says, well, I, um, okay.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:20]** Again, I'm, I'm, I'm telling you this because it is, I'm enlisting your help, um, song and, and Algiata.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:24]** Um, they've gotten into a few shouting matches.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:27]** Algiata could be rough around the edges.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:37]** Um, Algiata and, and, and, and, and, and graph, they, they used to be close, but for some reason they, they stopped talking.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:38]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:47]** But look, you know how it can be on these long voyages, cooped up, sane people, day after day.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:51]** I don't know.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:54]** That's the best of my knowledge.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Well, thank you so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:56 - 00:30:01]** We'll be sure to be helpful and we'll let you know if we find anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Yes.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:02]** All right.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:06]** Thank you for your candor, Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** Thank you.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** I'm moving you guys over to the map.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:11]** I put your pawns in the same place, I think.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:15]** Thank you for helping out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** Look, thank you for respecting.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:20]** Is she being genuine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Sure.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** I think she is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** I got a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** Yeah, she seems genuine.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:44]** She really seems like she is trying to overcome whatever sense of self-doubt in order to make decisions, be active, handle things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:51]** No, but I mean, in her response, like about what was other people.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:51]** Yeah.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** Was she hiding anything?

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** That's what I wanted to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** Oh, I'll say this.

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:02]** You recall that Keeve, when they picked up the phone, they said, oh, hi, Lozu, honey.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** And then she quickly cut it off.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:09]** And that's probably, other than that, she seems unsure about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** Who picked up the phone?

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:10]** Keeve.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** Keeve.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:13]** So her and Keeve are together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Are close.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:17]** That's, you're 22, you're sense motive.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:22]** I'm kind of treating that a little bit as like a wisdom, like remembering, kind of putting things together.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:25]** You like asked about it and you're like, I don't.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:46]** you know and so i think it's important to know that she has you think she's told you everything that she knows she's not like trying to keep like she's not hiding any like like she doesn't know any of the crews like up to no good or whatever i mean she told you that there were some people who didn't have the best relationship to algiata okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:53]** Rick tells Lozu, he looks at her, this is like a final statement from him, is like, Lieutenant Lozu, thank you for your assistance.

**[00:31:53 - 00:32:02]** I apologize if I came off brash, but I need to inform you that I believe Algiata and possibly this Vesk may not have good intentions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:04]** Okay.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:06]** Thank you.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:09]** I will handle Chostenek.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:19]** I will let you guys know that I will be taking Chostenek to his quarters and I will be detaining him as I think that's probably the safest place.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:24]** I'm taking you on your word that he is somebody of danger.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:27]** So again, I'm glad that you're okay.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:29]** Thank you for telling me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:38]** And Nico's going to look over at Rick, and he's going to say, let's trust the first mate for now.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** I think she's got a good handle on it.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** And he's going to wink over at Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:45]** He likes to wink a lot.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Is that your silver bullet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:47]** Yeah.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** It's your silver bullet.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** He's got a natural charm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:52]** Does he?

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:56]** Here's really wants to find the relic at this point.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** Don't know if he wants to help out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** Nico's kind of bitching on that as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:10]** Yeah, this had better not turn into another Butterskull Ranch where we never really get to do that thing because we do like a bunch of side quests, even if they are important quests.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:13]** Damn!

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Well, okay.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** That's not a John thing.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** That's like everyone decided to do different stuff.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:18]** And it's cool.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:19]** But I do want to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:21]** That's what I was going to say.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** You all were like, all right, it's not going to do that.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:28]** But I'm just going to say, I mean, every road here will turn up something.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:30]** Each road leads somewhere.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:32]** Yeah, which one leads to the relic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:35]** Just not back to the Butterskull Ranch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** The one that leads to Butterskull Ranch.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** We'll get there someday.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:41]** I swear to God, it better be the best payoff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** Okay, for...

**[00:33:43 - 00:34:07]** for the listeners we have another role-playing game we'll leave it unnamed that we are all playing together it's right pop and butter school ranch is a destination for kelly's character that we have been avoiding yeah good things inside jokes play really well um they play really well it's okay butters it's okay it's okay butters all right so what do you guys want to do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:29]** what do you think here's really wants to wants to check out these other rooms this is is this the gym you do recall that being the gym i'm gonna just peek in here real quick okay so you guys start walking as i am unveiling this tell me what you all are thinking about where you want to go


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:33]** So Nico wants to walk up alongside Rick.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:39]** And what he's going to say is this is like, look, I don't trust anybody so long.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** Anybody so far.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:45]** She anybody and anybody could be doing anything for any reason.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:54]** To be honest, I kind of think we should go back and peek on her first without her knowledge or where and see what she does with the vest.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** Then afterwards.

**[00:34:55 - 00:35:02]** I say we go find what's in that relic, and let's see who's the most interested in it after that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:07]** Okay, I second that, but definitely the relic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:11]** Rick says, like, I would like to escort her back, but she did not seem to want that.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:15]** My concern is for her safety, not the other way around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:18]** Well, let us go-

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:49]** cover me for a moment i'm gonna try and sneak and just observe see what she does i'll i'll peep back the moment the moment things seem fine if someone wants to come along with just tell them i dropped a syringe and you're looking for it for me okay so you all are going to uh i'm gonna search well let's let's deal with one thing at a time here so uh

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:52]** You, Hears, and Nico.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** What is going on?

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** I'm sneaking.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:56]** Hears, are you sneaking?

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** I will do that.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:58]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Okay.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** Ooh!

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** 17 on the die plus six.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** Mama, I'm 23!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** I will say this.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:13]** There are two closed doors, and you can't see her, so...

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:17]** Yeah, for all intents and purposes, no one's going to hear you through that wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:24]** No, what I'm trying to do, that stealth roll is for him sneaking up there and opening the door without anybody noticing.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:25]** Same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** Oh, okay.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** I got a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:30]** You sneakily push the button to open the door and the door goes off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** I will say this.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:31]** Yeah.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** I will say this.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:35]** You all did say I'm going to sneak.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:39]** And then later when I called you on it, you're like, you're like, all right.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:41]** Like it's also for the door.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:43]** So I'm just letting it go because it's a minor thing.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** But make sure you say I'm going to go do the door.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** All right.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** Yeah.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:58]** So you go, the door opens and the door makes the same sound, but

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:02]** Because of your sneak rolls, here's, what was your sneak roll?

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:02]** 16.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** 16.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:12]** Because of your sneak roll, there's just like, just by luck, it seems like she doesn't turn around.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:20]** And so you see her, let me reveal this, what you guys can see.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:39]** you see her walking up to the crate seems like she she had been kind of walking around and then she walks back to this one here and she knocks on it and then you from where you are you can hear like a muffled voice and you hear her say like

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:43]** Trostenek, is that you in there?

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** You hear more muffles.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:52]** And then you just see her starting to kind of look and figure out how to best take the door off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** Nico's just going to stay there and just continue to observe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** Where are you at in this room?

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:02]** Did you go into the room or are you just at the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:05]** Before you go into the room, if you're going to go into the room.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** We're not going into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:06]** Okay.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** We're not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:13]** So Rick, Rick is standing by the door, the other door with his gun up and he's just like watching the other two.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Okay.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:18]** He's concerned that, that trust Nick is going to break out of this box and do something crazy.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** So, and he knows that the other two would act on that.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** So if anything goes wrong, he's kicking this door open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Okay.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:29]** And I'm seeing, I'm watching Rick with these doors open with our heads, just poking around the corner.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:31]** Eventually she'll notice this, right?

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** Shouldn't we go in and hide behind a crate or something?

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** This is pretty suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:41]** I will say that I have started to roll to see whether she just happens to turn around and see the door open and two heads standing there.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:46]** So know that I am actively doing that every little bit of time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:50]** So here's like elbows nickel, Nico.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** And it's like, all right, come on.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Let's get a better place.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** Nicole.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** And it's like, let's find a better place to hide.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** Okay.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** Make another stealth check.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** And he goes behind.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** Make another stealth check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:03]** Yeah.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:06]** And Nico's going to follow him as well.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** And I'll roll another stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** Oh, damn.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** Come on.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** I'm just so damn good.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** 19 plus 6.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** Son of a bitch.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:17]** 18 for Kelly for years.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:17]** Okay.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:21]** You guys, you do move in.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:29]** Right as you move in, what you don't see is her look back because she heard the door shut and she was like, huh.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:32]** And then just goes back to try to...

**[00:39:32 - 00:40:02]** open it and you guys are peeking over the crate you feel pretty confident she doesn't see you and you see her be like alright well look just be patient I'm trying to find the best way to open this crate and then you hear more like okay seems like she's getting directions for how to open it and after a minute maybe you're there for another minute or so

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:29]** just rolling um she does manage to get the door to kind of like come off a bit right and she does allow for it to open and lets it kind of fall down and trust the neck is still just sitting there and trust the neck bound thank you thank you i uh i don't know what happened

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** And she seems a little guarded.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:36]** She's got one hand kind of like behind her back, like turned, but like on her weapon.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:40]** And she says, well, I think it's best that you follow me.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:45]** I'm sorry to hear that something might have...

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:52]** Happen and transpire, but I do have to say that I think it's best if you follow me and we're going to go to your quarters.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:59]** And Trostenec is the reason why I'm kind of being material.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:01]** And then you can't really hear what he says.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:04]** And she's like, please, just come with me.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** I would appreciate if you just come with me.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:09]** We can talk about it on the way.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:19]** But I think for the safety of everyone else and for you, best that you remain in your quarters.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:27]** And draws the neck, sighs, closes his eyes, and all right, all right.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:30]** Seeming to see this body language of he's going to nod.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:34]** She turns around, starts to walk out the door.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:41]** Give me another stealth check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** Uh, 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** That's a 15 for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** 15?

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:45]** Yeah.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Kelly?

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** 10.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** 10?

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:49]** Yeah.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:52]** Why?

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:55]** So as she starts to...

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** So sorry, I didn't reveal Trostnack on the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** So you trip over the robot that's still there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:01]** Yeah.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:07]** So as they start to walk out, you maybe here's your, you're trying to look over, follow them.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:26]** And you like hit one of the, the, the ropes that's holding the boxes and it makes like a, and they both look over and with your 10, you kind of duck and Lozu turns to Trostnack and says, is, is, is, is there anyone else in here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:53]** is is this this is i'm gonna roll and see what she does nico is cut nina's cut nico's kind of elbowing here's like i'm just kind of wildly gesticulating over here's to kind of be quiet rick is nervous at this point and because you guys have been in there for a long time and so he's gonna walk like midway through this hallway and so he's between both doors lozu starts to walk


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** Trostenec is still bound.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** She starts to walk a little bit up.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:10]** And right when it seems like she might come around the corner, you hear like, First mate, can you please report to the bridge?

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** Sure, sure.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:12]** She stops.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:14]** Turns around.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** Come, come, come, Trostenec.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:21]** I'll take you to your room.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** Almost found you out.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:50]** she leaves and nico nico's gonna nico's gonna exhale like quietly to here's how's close and as she walks out uh she looks oh oh rick hi um i i rolled a an eight for self uh stuff yeah yeah she sees you immediately hi rick uh hi hi our our is it is everything okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** Everything is fine, Lieutenant.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** I was just making sure that you were okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** I'm fine.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** I'm fine.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:10]** I'm just taking Trostenek to his room, and Trostenek turns, looks at Lozu, and then turns back to you, Rick, and goes...

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** It's Keeve!

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:14]** It's Keeve!

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:17]** Trostenec, please, come on.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** It's Keeve!

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:22]** And she has to start to pull Trostenec away.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:25]** But then Trostenec stops and kind of starts to walk away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** Rick just nods at him.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** He accepts it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:28]** Okay.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** And then they walk around the corner.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** Doctor, okay, I see that you stepped inside the gym.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:33]** I'm assuming that you closed the doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:37]** Are they, like, electric doors?

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** Like...

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** Are they Star Trek doors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** They're not going to open.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:44]** They're not going to open from people walking by.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:48]** They're going to open if you just kind of walk over and try to go in.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:53]** So unless you want to do anything, you hear footsteps and they just walk on by.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** Can I crack open?

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** Can I listen?

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** No.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** You can listen, but you just hear footsteps.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Okay.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:00]** Yep.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** And then they walk the site.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** So Dr. Okay, Rick, here's Nico.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** What are you guys doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:09]** So are they already outside the hallway now?

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** They walked away.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** They walked away.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:17]** Nico's going to look over at here's and he's going to be like, all right, show's over.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Let's get out of here.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** Didn't sound like she was in on it.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** No, didn't.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** You see anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** Do you guys come down the hallway towards me?

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:31]** And he's going to be like, trust a neck.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:35]** He looked at me and he said, it's Keeve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** My rat guy?

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** I heard it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** Did you walk back towards us, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** You would know that Keeve is the Marakoi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:49]** Graf is the... Yeah, Keeve is the one in the engine room that she told us to go help.

**[00:45:49 - 00:46:05]** And Rick's senses are going off because if Keeve is the one, and he's telling you guys this, if Keeve is the suspect, that means that Lieutenant Lozu might be involved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** Dr.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** O.K., were you looking at all in the gym or did you just duck in?

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:11]** Yeah, I wanted to look around.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** You said before you wanted to look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:23]** I want to look in every room that I visit for any evidence of a crime or... Give me a perception check as you were kind of standing there.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** Uh... 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:29]** Six incapacitator robots walking towards you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:29]** Yeah.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:33]** The ship goes on lockdown.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:34]** Uh...

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:43]** No, you think maybe it's just the way that the water was flowing and the lighting in the room.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:49]** You thought there was something on the floor over near some of the exercise equipment in the back corner.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:53]** But then you're like, eh, it's just a thing.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** You were like, is that?

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** And then you're like, no, that's just part of the equipment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** With a 19?

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:02]** I would take 20 then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:07]** If you want to take 20, then that's fine.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:09]** But what are they doing while you're taking 20?

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:15]** So yeah, by the time that's happened, I've explained to them that Trostnik said it was Keeve.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:19]** And then we walked down knowing that he... Because Rick saw him go into the gym.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:23]** So he would tell the other guys, like, let's go check him out.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** And so they would go to the gym.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:28]** So I will stop at the gym door and let you decide how to handle it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** Okay.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:33]** I mean, you could assume that I was taking 20 while...

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:36]** But it didn't take 20 minutes while that was happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:40]** So I'm just saying if you want to do that, other things will happen, right?

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:44]** Again, this is this idea that everything that you do, right?

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** Because I'll say this.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:46]** It's important.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:50]** Before we jump into that, it's important to note what time has passed.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** You guys got on.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** The lice happened.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** It was like yesterday, right?

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** You all went to sleep.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** That was yesterday.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** This is day two.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** You woke up.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:06]** There was the issue with the hobgoblin and the goblins trying to get in and song.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:09]** Then Lozu came up saying, where's Algiata?

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** The ship's power goes down.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:13]** Then you guys are like, all right.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** So then you go.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** You talk to Professor Benjamin.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:17]** He talks about he asked you to help out.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:19]** He mentions what he's worried about.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** You will go check it out.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** There's a fight.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:25]** It's probably, I would say, getting close to noon at this point.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:29]** How long is the trip to Epsilon Station?

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** I don't actually know.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:33]** I mean, what is the ETA?

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** Is it supposed to be a six-day trip?

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:36]** Is it a 30-day trip?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** No, it's not a 30-day trip.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** It's like within a week.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** Depends on... Okay, so seven days, we'll say.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** Yeah, it depends on how fast you're going.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:44]** The...

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:48]** The ship's engines are, you know, there's something happening with the ship.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** Yeah, so we're stranded.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** That's going to add on some time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** Okay, here's another, this is another just like Starfinder question.

**[00:48:53 - 00:49:04]** So the drift, I don't know how many people are listening to understand what the drift is, but the drift is almost like a jet stream that travels across the galaxies in Starfinder.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:08]** And you can enter the drift and exit.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:12]** My question is, what happens if you're in the drift and then you lose your engines?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:14]** I mean, you stay in the drift.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** You're just not moving in the drift.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** Right.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:27]** So the drift was created as like another like the triune god of three different gods essentially like gave the universe the gift of the drift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:32]** And so it's almost like it's it's like a not time travel, but it's like a it's like a wormhole type thing.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:33]** In a way.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:34]** Yeah.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:38]** So it's not like light speed where like you're going a certain speed.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:45]** As soon as you come out of that, you are no longer – you're actually going into a physical existence.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:50]** Just, Kev, if you just Lorenz it, then it's fine.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:52]** Then, you know, it's all right.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** About to join us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:37]** uh yeah i don't know about how long it would take us to get to the door and okay and we would just enter the room you would just go in as well yeah is there a window on the the gym or no or the door uh there's like a little thing so i mean rick would glance in there first and see and see dr okay and then he would hit the button to go in yeah unless there was something crazy going on in there because then he

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** No, it's fine.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:42]** I'm waiting for something to jump out of this pool or whatever.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** Oh, man.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:46]** Wouldn't that be awesome?

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** You see something on the pool water.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** It's going to be pool ice.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** That's my John impersonation.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** It's going to be pool ice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:53]** You see something on the water.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** Is that how I talk?

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:54]** Is that how I talk, Kuv?

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** Yeah, that's how I hear you.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** Rude.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:01]** I edit my voice so it sounds mellifluous on this podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:04]** The audience doesn't know, but you actually have a really high-pitched voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** I do, actually.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** I do.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** Which, nothing wrong with high-pitched voices.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Totally all good.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** So here's the thing.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:13]** Dr.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:19]** O.K., you walk over, and you're looking.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:28]** This room, you know, it's mirrored, just like gyms are.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:32]** You walk past the sparring mats.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:34]** They're a little frayed, a little old.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** Some of the machine models of the workout stuff.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:40]** Older.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:46]** It's right about here that you in the center.

**[00:51:48 - 00:52:14]** where there seems to be like a glint of kind of coppery metal under one of the exercise machines and as you reach down because i'm assuming what was your take 20 you took 20 what's your bonus uh plus for what perception yeah for perception three okay perfect

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:20]** You see a glint of coppery metal.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:33]** And then as you reach down, it's this wide ornate metal ring among a bunch of dust bunnies.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Give me a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:42]** Culture check, all right.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** 23.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** Wow, nice.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:49]** My culture is like stacked by the way, plus seven.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** Stacked?

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** I'm very cultured.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:59]** Interestingly, you notice that it's a piece of jewelry.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** I'm gonna show it here on the screen.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:03]** Little shift Z, roll 20 action.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:03]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:09]** It is a piece of jewelry with all these engraved lines and jewels.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:18]** And you recognize it as a traditional Yosuke tail ring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:22]** What?

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:22]** Oh, God.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** What happened to Rat Guy?

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:24]** Is somebody dead?

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:26]** Did he get pulled in the water?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:30]** Well, the Yosuke is Grath, and Grath is the one that... Oh, my God.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:32]** And Mozu told us that... Grath is our friend.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** We like Grath.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** Yeah.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:38]** Algiata has something against Grath, and Grath is the Yosuke.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:38]** Oh, my God.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:38]** Oh, my God.
