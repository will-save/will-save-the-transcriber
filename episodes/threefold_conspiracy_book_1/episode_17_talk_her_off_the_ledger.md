**[00:00:00 - 00:00:09]** Last time on We'll Save, the group encounters Gingeroga on the bridge in the midst of her hostile mutiny.

**[00:00:10 - 00:00:20]** Unlike how she appeared last time to the group, Gingeroga has shapeshifted into the werewolf, revealing her membership to the bar guest species.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:30]** After a brief conversation, our adventures are goaded into a firefight when Gingeroga takes a bite out of the captain and throws him to the ground.

**[00:00:31 - 00:00:42]** With the captain lying motionless on the floor, first mate Lozu can only watch in horror as Gingeroga charges Nico Ryan, eager to take a bite out of her next victim.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:45]** Is this the end for Nico?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:48]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:45]** I can't tell you how excited I am to just crush all of you.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** Because after next... False.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:51]** After last week's episode, I'm about to crush Nico.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:54]** And Nico will be the first pawn to fall.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:56]** But... Wow.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:56]** Okay.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:56]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:58]** I may regret these words, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:59 - 00:01:59]** You probably will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** But bring it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** That's fine.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** I will happily... Let me just write down in my notes.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** Please bring it.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:09]** Okay.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** All right.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:10]** Written down.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Here is the thing.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:21]** I want to ask you guys this, because it's always good to take a step back for just a second and think about how far we've come.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:25]** This is episode 17, and I just... I want to ask...

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:34]** What, if any, thoughts do you have that you think should have should have changed that should have done something different there?

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** Maybe it's like a character choice.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Maybe it's a decision.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:41]** Maybe it's I wish I had done this.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** Should have taken this feat.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:49]** Shouldn't have taken the delay action, Kev, because I didn't know about the change in the initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:49 - 00:03:18]** bullshit rules hey whoa whoa this is a family podcast sorry I'm still bitter I'm really bitter about the like the change in initiative order so I'll start I'll start I took the improved initiative feat but I got to change it because it's worthless there's no reason to have improved initiative if you don't if you're trying to like talk your way out of a fight because then you have to delay and that changes your initiative order so there's no point having the initiative in the first place


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** That is a fair... My only regret.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** That is a fair... That's your only regret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** Others.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** You want me to talk about other ones?

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** Do you want to talk about other ones?

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:33]** I'm a very insecure person, so I have tons of regrets.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:33]** Whoa, whoa.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** No, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:35]** It's all good.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** I mean, it's your time, Kevin.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:37]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** We are here.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:41]** We and the listeners are here to hear that.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** You know, we're talking about it.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** Look, I'm just saying, you can talk about any thoughts that you have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:48]** There was one time in third grade... No, um...

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:51]** I'm not here to be your therapist, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** That one's a brutal one.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:56]** Not to be insensitive, but do you really want to talk about anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** No, I'm good.

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:04]** Game-wise, though, I had this conversation off... I tried to have this conversation with John off-air.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:08]** But my thought as that door was opening and I'm like, man, we're about to die.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:12]** I was like, man, what if there's another way into this room?

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:20]** Like we could have gone, you know, a back door or like through the ventilation system and gotten like a jump on on the bad guy.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** That was my thought.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:27]** It was like, that's my regret was not taking a second to think like, should we just charge in or should we like go around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:31]** And all that I said when you asked me that, and I'll say it again here.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:31]** Answer that.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** I can't answer it.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** Well, I... Yes.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** Oh, I couldn't answer it.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:34]** I'm not allowed to.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** Yeah, that's part of the GM code.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** I signed a contract.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:42]** It was total NDA about the details of the story.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** Weak.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:47]** But what I did say was I will always present you with opportunities.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:50]** I'm never going to, like, shut down...

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:57]** or railroad you in order to come to some certain place per se, I'm just going to give you a lot of opportunities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** Keep that in mind next time.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** You always have opportunities.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** I'm going to support them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** Anybody else?

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:05]** I have a regret.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** Okay.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:07]** Regret.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:15]** I originally thought I was going to regret the other thing because I realized I was standing in the door at the beginning of the last episode.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:15]** Yeah.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:18]** And now kind of hindsight, it's always 2020.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:19]** I get that.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:29]** But knowing how it played out now, that ginger Roga was going to bite that guy anyway, unless I did something.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:34]** And I was all queued up and ready to go with the ultimate Obi-Wan Kenobi like moment.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:38]** The doors open to Nico Ryan with two guns pointed at the guy.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** All he could have said was Kenobi uses guns.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:45]** He's got him pointed at Gingeroga.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:49]** All he could have said, all Niko needed to say was, hello there.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** And then shot.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** That is a missed opportunity.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** Absolutely.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** That's absolutely the case.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** I'll say this.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** That was my first instinct.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** I should have listened to it.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:03]** I didn't do it because I was like, crap, I'm just going to pull the rest of the party in immediately.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** But hindsight.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:07]** Like I said, I'm always going to give you opportunities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:09]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** Decisions have consequences, though.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** And Gingeroga is about to kill Niko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** Yeah.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:20]** But before we get to that, because I do want to get to that, it'll be really satisfying.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** But does anyone else have any thoughts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:26]** Will, Kelly?

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** I don't really have any regrets, I have to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:33]** It's very early to have for my character, I feel.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:37]** However, I may have regretted something this episode.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** Oh, last episode?

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** What's that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:40]** It started.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** Yeah, wait, this episode already?


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:46]** I like just the things that are going to, you know, happen.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:51]** I just get that suspicion that I should have maybe boosted some of their abilities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:54]** Maybe I should have said a proper goodbye to Nico.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:58]** That's probably the biggest thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** That's fair.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** That's fair.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** Wow.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** No, Niko.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** No, Kelly.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:06]** This is going to be the long farewell here.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:08]** Okay, sorry.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** That was kind of dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** No, it's fine.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:12]** Actually, I don't get that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:18]** I think it's a good transition to what's about to happen.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:23]** I don't know about you all, but I'm ready to see what happens.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** I'm going to move you all over to the map.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:29]** You're on our little landing page, one of several.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:31]** And now you're back on the map.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:33]** And here we are again.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:37]** Another week, another hour aboard the Chimera.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:40]** Plus or minus some other time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:50]** Just to update the listeners, last week we opened up the doors and this giant werewolf bat thing was trying to take over the bridge.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:54]** Since then, two of us, Piers and Rick, have run into the room and taken cover.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:58]** And then the other three characters had stayed in the hall.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:04]** And now the giant weird bat thing has charged at Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:13]** And it's good because, you know, Nick in his like preview saying at the top of the episode saying what happened is like high level.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:17]** And then this was a good detailed thing of like specifically what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:19]** Like layout-wise.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:19]** No, it's important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:25]** And Captain Rameem is lying on the floor in the center of this octagonal bridge.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** Octagonal.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** Octagonal.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:36]** And I believe last time we ended on a roll to see how quickly Nico will die.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:37]** Nico.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** John, here's my question.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:39]** Yes.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** Here's my question.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:40]** Hold on.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** Wait.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:43]** Let me refer to my note where I said, please bring it.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** Okay.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** Referred.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:49]** Am I or am I not wearing red?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** Good stuff.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:54]** Good stuff.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** You know what I'm a counter with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** Does a 24 hit?

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:02]** Yes, it does.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** Yep.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:05]** It hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** That hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:08]** That is exactly what I thought.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** How do criticals work in this?

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** If you roll, is that it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** It was not a critical.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:13]** I will tell you that much.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** But she did claw you.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:20]** And this is going to be intense.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:25]** because using the die that Kev gave me, Kev, you have, this is your fault.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:35]** Nico is going to take 10 points of damage as this claw just comes and cuts into your side.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:47]** Maybe you tried to move out of the way and her reach was just enough and she just totally scratches you on your side for 10 points of damage.

**[00:09:47 - 00:10:14]** oh man this is good stuff hey john yeah at the risk of incurring the wrath of the dean of the dean here i still have stamina points hey bring it dude come on hey sorry let me just bold and capitalize bring it and then we're good all right rick 19 title this episode not rick 18 what are you going to do so rick is still staggered okay um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:19]** means I can either move or attack, and I can only do one or the other, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** Yes, as staggered.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** You have a clearer shot now, baby.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** You do have a good shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** If I move, I have an okay shot.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** It looks like there's still some partial coverage.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** No, I'll say that.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** You think it's clear?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** Yeah.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** I'll say that there's no cover.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:35]** Clear shot.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** The door is open, so you got a clear shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Probably going to regret that.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:44]** So we're going to have to add up all these bonuses then to see what we got.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** So let me just, I'm going to start with my roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:47]** Okay.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** Let's start with your roll.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** Just raw dice roll.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** Roll big.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** Roll big.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** I picture the wheel of fortune.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:00]** And it teeters between two and 18.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** And what'd you get?

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:02]** Two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:06]** No!

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:06]** Nice.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** How dare you.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** Very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** Rick raises his gun.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** I don't even think we have to add the bonuses.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** Plus two from a herring fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:18]** And minus two because Jinchiroga, I believe, is what was the?

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:20]** Minus two to the AC.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** Flat-footed.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** She's minus two from Nico's trick attack.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** But that hits for this whole round.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:28]** But, yeah, that hits for sure.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:33]** So you fire an ice carbine actually at the enemy, not at Lozu this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Slow down.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:35]** All right.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** I mean, it's like super slow motion.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:40]** Rick, you know, he's staggered.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:53]** So he's like kind of soft on his feet, but he raises his gun and it's just shaking with energy because last round here's reached out and supercharged my ice carbine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** Have you considered Dr. Scholl's?

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:57]** He said you were soft on your feet.

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:00]** That got Nick.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** Hashtag Dr. Soul.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:05]** Just trying to get sponsorships wherever we can.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** Keep our little podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:11]** We've already sold our soul, ladies and gentlemen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:13]** What is your overcharged weapon damage?

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** Overcharged?

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** 4d6?

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:18]** 4d6, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Supercharged?

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:23]** 4d6.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:26]** Does somebody want to record this for me so I don't have to remember?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** Supercharged.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** Just say them out loud and we'll all do the math together.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:29]** Four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:30]** Four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** Five.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:33]** Five.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:33]** That's nine.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:36]** Three.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** That's 12.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Five.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:38]** Five.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** That's 17.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:40]** Nice.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** Plus what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:45]** Plus my roll of a D6.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:46]** No, sorry, D8.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** For the ice carbine?

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** Yeah.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** For the ice carbine.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** And that is a six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:53]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** So that is 23.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:54]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:58]** Ridiculous.

**[00:12:59 - 00:12:59]** That's great.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:06]** Gun is just like, it's so supercharged, but it's a cryo weapon, so it's just like that fog of just cryogenic...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:09]** Direct hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:11]** Yeah, that is awesome.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:12]** Wow.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:13]** Wow.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:14]** Wow.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** Fires.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:26]** Nico, you get hit, but then Jinchuroga stumbles in front of you as you see this massive ice blue beam just hit Jinchuroga in the back.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** Not expecting at all.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:35]** Jinchuroga is a little off her feet, but she is still standing, rearing to go.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** Good move, Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** Yikes.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Thank you.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:41]** Hears, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** What are you doing?

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:48]** Hears' hand was just on his shoulder, and he was just looking excitedly the whole time, like right behind Rick.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** He's giggling.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:50]** Yeah.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:58]** He's pretty stoked about the result, so Hears is going to slap another supercharged weapon on that gun there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** Nice.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:00]** Okay.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:02]** Let's end this.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:02]** Impressive.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** Impressive.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:05]** Impressive.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:08]** And Rick, you're keeping track of how many charges you have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:12]** Hold on, let me look.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:16]** I have two more shots from this gun before it's empty.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:22]** I was looking, though, because I thought the battery thing was specific to your... I have extra batteries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** So you could reload.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** So I could reload, yeah.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:26]** Okay.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** I think that takes a round.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** Yeah, I think that's a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Doctor, okay, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:33]** What are you doing?

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:41]** Seeing that giant blast in front of me, I think.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:48]** Can I do a life science to see what... Or I guess like a medicine check, I guess?

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** To see what she's at?

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** Or...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:56]** I won't tell you if what her number is, but I'll tell you whether she's like close to death or not.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** If you want to do a medicine check.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:59]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** Although I feel like, yeah, it's probably medicine since you're trained.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** It could be perception too.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** What'd you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** Medicine.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** I got a 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:09]** Yeah, she is not close to death.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Hurt, but not close to death.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Thank God.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** This is a tank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** Yep.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:19]** I am going to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:20]** Okay.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** This is the attack.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:24]** You don't have the plus two from Lozu's Harrying Fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** No.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** No.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:35]** And I can, quote, drop a weapon and just pick a melee up and still attack with it, I think, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Yeah, I think you could.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:40]** Although now you have a plus one attack bonus, so you can switch weapons, right?

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:44]** Pretty sure that your attack bonus is now plus one second level, so you could switch weapons.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** And then you're going to step up and attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:47 - 00:16:10]** yeah okay yeah yeah oh yeah i'm going to take my syringe spear with the i'm gonna give him i'm gonna give him a minor inhibitor okay i'm gonna tell you this are you uh is your syringe spear five feet like what's the reach on that it's a melee okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** Well, but you have to be next, right?

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** So you step up?

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:14]** Yeah.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:15]** Okay.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** Guarded step.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:24]** You don't need to make a guarded step per se, but when you step up, you do realize that you get a flanking bonus because Grath is on the other side.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:29]** So if you can picture it, listeners, Jin Chiroga is standing right outside the door.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** Nico is directly below.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:31]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** is directly to the left.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** Grath is directly to the right.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:37]** She is totally surrounded.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** So you get plus two to your attack, Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** All right.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:43]** Here goes nothing.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** Here goes nothing.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:48]** 17.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** 17 against what?

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:50]** Against KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:51]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:54]** Yeah, that is a hit because of the minus two.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** So well done.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:57]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:23]** from being flat-footed for this round so uh imagine if you will dr okay lunging forward with a giant spears you know that sort of like appeared from from behind and he rolls four that's critical damage so that's eight points of damage wow okay wow wow and then what is a result of the uh

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:43]** the minor booster or the inhibitor yeah yeah so for seven rounds you take a minus one penalty to attack rolls okay um yeah okay minus one penalty to attack rolls nice wow good stuff


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:46]** I think you all will be dead within seven rounds, but that's fine.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** We'll see what happens.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Good move.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** Good move.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** You know who's turn it is?

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** What?

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** That wasn't enough?

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:54]** I guess not.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:56]** No, that was definitely not enough.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:58]** So it's Grath's turn.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** Good move, Dr. Okay.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:05]** I'm not sure if Grath... I think Grath would probably step back.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:10]** and not incur an attack of opportunity against Jinchuroga by attacking.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:16]** Because if you make a ranged attack within melee range, that incurs an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** Do a guarded step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** He could.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:20]** He could.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** I think that's what he would probably do.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:28]** So he's going to take a five-foot step back, and he's going to shoot at Jinchuroga.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:29]** And eyeball.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:31]** Right in the eyeball.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** Let's see what you got, Yasuki.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:35]** That is...

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:35]** What is it?

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** Minus two, right?

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** So that's a 17.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** That is a hit from grass.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** Part of me is happy.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** Part of me is not.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** Let's see.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** Playing myself here.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:53]** That is going to be three points of damage.

**[00:18:52 - 00:19:10]** from grass as a azimuth laser bolt fires and hits jinn chiroga who looks dr okay like she is getting down she's starting to seem pretty hurt and nico it is your turn what are you doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:13]** I got a question, actually.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:13]** Yeah.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:15]** I can't find this in the rulebook.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:18]** I've seen it commented a couple places.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:18]** Okay.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** On some of the blogs.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:25]** But can I do a full round attack and do a guarded step at the same time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** No, I don't think so.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:29]** That's a blue action and a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:29]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:30]** Full attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:35]** So if I do a full attack, will I invoke a cap?

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** Attack of opportunity?

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** Range weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:38]** Yes.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** If you're shooting within melee range, yes.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** definitely worth it.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:48]** Considering that you leveled up to level two, there's not a guarantee that you're going to hit.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** Or, sorry, that she's going to hit you.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** But it is worth two attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** I don't think it is worth two attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** Okay, it's not worth two attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:07]** I think Nico... You were the one who said bring it, so... If you step back, you lose the flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:10]** Because Graf has now stepped back, Dr. Okay loses flanking.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:12]** Nico does not have flanking on an attack now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:21]** I thought it's in a threatened square for at least one... Graf is no longer within the... Graf has stepped back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** There's five feet between them.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** They are not... Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** is still within five feet.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** Yeah, for Graf.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:31]** So Graf might be able to have flanking, but Dr. O.K.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:35]** does not have flanking because it's not... What about the opposite of you?

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** Yeah, they have to be opposite.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** It says opposite.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** Directly opposite?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:39]** Where do you see that?

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** Uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:46]** It makes sense because that's how you get flanked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** Opposite corner or opposite corner?

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** I agree.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:53]** Opposite corner meaning if you're on like a... You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:53]** All right.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** All right.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:54]** Just saying.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** Wow.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:55]** Cool.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:59]** I mean... Not only are you guys attacking my creature, you're attacking me.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** So I see how this is going.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** Everyone surround and hug it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** Just hug it out, Jinchiroga.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:07]** He's got that hug bot back up and running.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:07]** Yeah.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** Yeah.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:08]** There's a hug bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** Hug bot.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:11]** Nico, what do you want to do?

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:16]** So Nico's going to take a guarded step back and he's going to do another trick attack.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:17]** The eyeball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** Shoot.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** He's going to say...

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** You look ugly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:39]** If this trick attack succeeds because you said you look ugly, I don't know what is going on here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:43]** I feel like that would get you inspiration in another game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** Your brother was a hamster.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:50]** He's going to look at this thing and say, you look ugly.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:54]** And then he's going to follow it up with saying, is this barrel too big?

**[00:21:54 - 00:22:00]** And he's going to roll another bluff check.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** He's going to roll another bluff for his trick attack.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:05]** It's a plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:05]** What's your roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:09]** Oh, that's a 14 on the dice plus eight.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:09]** 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** That's a 22.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** Does not succeed.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** So Nico's just going to shoot as is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** So you just shoot.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:23]** Jinchuruga seems unfazed by your insult.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** That's a plus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** So that's a 19.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** No, that's a 22 to hit.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:32]** That is a hit.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:34]** How am I doing this on this four-sided dice?

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** That is a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:41]** Four points of damage from another azimuth laser pistol.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:45]** Little hit by little hit.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** And you did your guarded step.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:52]** And it is now the top of round three.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:56]** I believe Nico is now not shaken.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** Lozu is now not shaken.

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:01]** And Jinchiroga now at their turn, right?

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** They won't be.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:05]** She will not be flat footed.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:07]** And it is Lozu's turn.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** And here's Rick.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:11]** You hear Lozu swear behind you.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Damn.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:16]** And then Lozu starts to move.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:21]** One, two, three, four, five.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:32]** And Lozu is going to stand next to the captain, look down at the captain, and then crouch and shoot again at Jin Chiroga doing another harrying fire.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:36]** That is a success.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:45]** So the next person who shoots Jinchuroga or attacks gets plus two from her harrying fire as she shoots.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:52]** And you can see Jinchuroga seem to be a little disconcerted because Grath hit with a laser pistol.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** Nico hit with a laser pistol.

**[00:23:54 - 00:24:00]** And then there's another laser pistol that flies past Jinchuroga and seems to hit the wall past Jinchuroga.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** Jinjiroga.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:08]** I'm going to say Jinjiroga again because it is her turn.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** And she is going to keep attacking Nick.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:14]** She's going to take a step forward and attack Nico again.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** Are you ready for this, Nico?

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:16]** Are you ready?

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:17]** Let's do it.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:18]** You ready?

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** You ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** I'm going to regret this.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:20]** You ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** So wait a second.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** Wait a second.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:24]** Wait a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:27]** That is... I have a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:36]** If my calculations are correct before your question, with her bite, that is a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:40]** Yeah, of course it hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** Against KSC.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:41]** Yes!

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:49]** In going after Nico, does Jintoroga incur an attack of opportunity?

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:53]** Ah, because she steps forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** Oh, that is a good... Into a threatened square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:03]** Still in one of your threatened squares, so it does not... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:08]** She would have to step out of a threatened square into another square that's not threatened.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:09]** Right?

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** Attack of opportunity.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** I'm looking right now.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:23]** When you threaten a space and the opponent moves out of that space in any way other than a guarded step or a withdraw action, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against the opponent.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:27]** I mean, I think she would take a guarded step and attack at Niko.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Okay.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:28]** Is that on?

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** I'm just looking online real quick.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** Cheater.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:34]** Okay.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** But good ask.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** So she takes a guarded step.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Yeah.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** But good ask.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** Nico.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:39]** Wow.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:43]** That is 14 points of damage to Nico.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:44]** Yeah.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** I'm unconscious now.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:45]** Woo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:47]** Great.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:47]** Wow.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** Okay.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** So you are down.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:53]** You went through your stamina points and your hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:55]** 14 points of damage, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:55]** Okay.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** Okay.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:58]** So you're now in resolve point territory.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** We're going to see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:04]** Can I use a resolve point right now to stabilize?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** It would have to be on your turn.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** Yep.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** And it is not your turn next.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** It is Rick19's turn.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** What are you going to do, Rick?

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** I don't know if you saw Nico go down.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:19]** Nico has moved now beyond your sight.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:19]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:26]** Rick is going to strafe across, and as he does so, he does see Niko's on the ground.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:26]** Yeah.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** Line up just straight.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:44]** He's not going to say anything because he's focused, but he's going to lift up his line, and he's going to roll to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:49]** Going to take another supercharged shot, right?

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** Bonuses are going on here.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:55]** You have a plus two from Harrying Fire from Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Plus nine.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:58]** Goodness.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** Seven of my basic bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:02]** That's insane.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** Classic Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** Insane bonuses.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:10]** Roll the 19!


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:11]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** That's what I'm talking about.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:19]** That definitely hits, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:22]** Yes, that absolutely hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:25]** Do this again.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** Let's do it again.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:33]** Since I have it supercharged, all that cryogenic fog coming off this gun just shakes with energy.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:37]** That's a 1 to start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:38]** That's a 6.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:39]** 7.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** That's another 1.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:41]** 8.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:43]** And a 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:45]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** And I roll my d8.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:47]** 8.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** Okay.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** For two points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:52]** Is that 15?

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:54]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:55]** Wow.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** Yeah.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:13]** I picture Nico falling on the ground, and Nico, as your eyes are starting to gloss over, as you're starting to fall unconscious, you see Jinchiroga lean over you and just start to snarl.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:27]** And you can see that Jinchiroga is hungry, and at that moment, you hear, and Jinchiroga falls onto you, dead.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** Yeah!

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:31]** Wow.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:32]** Yes.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:33]** Wow.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:43]** But we will stay in initiative order because Nico is down and unstable and potentially Captain Rameem as well.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:51]** So you siege and Chiroga go down after taking down Nico with literally two attacks.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** Imagine if you hadn't done those supercharged attacks.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** Imagine what would have happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** Good job, Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** Yeah, Hears.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** That was smart.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Yeah, Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:59 - 00:28:59]** That was smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:01]** That was all you're shooting, buddy.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:01]** All you're shooting.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Good job.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** Can we give Here's inspiration?

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** There's no inspiration.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** There's only punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** Use my punishment.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** I'm glad I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** Someone could DM me a pun, and then I could say it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** DM you a pun.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:13]** Yes.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** Here's, it's your turn.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:16]** What are you doing on your turn?

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Nico is down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:43]** presumably captain rameem is down here's can't do much about that okay unfortunately but he uh he just pulls out a rubik's cube i'm out yeah i'm out he he goes up to lozu um and starts to kind of interview her and says like what did that creature want tell me everything you know okay so you start talking to lozu who is looking out seeing this all go on


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Dr. K, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** Nico's down.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:56]** Can I assess in one turn the health of both Rameem and Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:56]** No.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** You could do one or the other.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:06]** You could move to, like I said before, you can move and you would probably need to be closer to Captain Rameem to see what Captain Rameem's at.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:11]** From here, you could probably see within 10 feet what Nico is at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Can I see what Nico's at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:15]** Describe.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:18]** That's not my, like, full action, is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** Yeah.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Nico, how were you hit?

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** He was bitten, wasn't he?

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** What happened to Nico?

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** Nico was bit.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** Bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** So I got bit in the chest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:27]** Damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** I got bit in the chest.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:32]** He tried to do the same thing that he did to Captain Rameem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:32]** Rameem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:34]** Yes.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** Rameem, yeah.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** Okay.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:40]** So you see bite marks kind of like in my chest slash shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:44]** Can I see if Rameem is conscious?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** You can't tell from this distance.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:48]** You need to move in and see.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:52]** I mean, look, you can tell that Nico is down unconscious.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** Like, this is a given.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:59]** You can tell that Captain Rameem, you're not quite sure.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:01]** Possibly, but you need to move in and see.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** From here, you can just tell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:03]** He's like a vampire bat.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:07]** It's going to, like, Ramin's going to pop back up and try to kill us all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** That'd be creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:08]** Really?

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:12]** Well, the way, like, there's only one bad guy in the room.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** That's suspicious.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:14]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:16]** Okay.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Well.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** What do you want to do on your turn?

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:29]** I'll move over and I guess give a... Are you stable?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Nico is not stable.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** No, I'm not.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** I am not stable.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** You can do first aid.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** I'm not stable at any speed.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:35]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** I'll do first aid.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Okay.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Give me a medicine check.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** Okay.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:46]** Medicine check, no big deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** Not a big deal.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** Does the 19 do it?

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:51]** A 19 does meet the DC 15.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:51]** Yes.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** So Nico is now stable.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** Good move.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** Nico, you're good.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** You are stable.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:00]** You are not going to possibly die.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Thank you.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:02]** Dr.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** O.K., you want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** I don't know.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** Okay.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:06]** All right.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** No worries.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:14]** Uh, graph is going to run up, look at Jen Schroeder for a second, and then look at Nico and look at you, Dr. Okay.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:16]** And say, is he okay?

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:20]** I think, I, I think there's some, uh, there's some serums in there here.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:21]** Hold on one sec.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** And then, so he moved five feet.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** He's going to move another five feet.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** That's 15.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:32]** He's going to start to run in and try and, uh, see if he can find something to give to Nico.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** Nico, it's your turn.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:37]** Whatever you were going to stick back in, wait, because it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:42]** Okay, so Nico is just going to... Am I awake or am I just stable?

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** You're just stable.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:46]** You need one hit point to be awake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Okay.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** Yeah, Niko's just lying on the ground.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:55]** Any particularly awesome thoughts or dreams that you're having as you're unconscious but stable?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:00]** He's having this weird dream with the sound in the back of his head going like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:04]** There's a lady who's sure...

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:07]** All that glitters is gold.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:13]** And she's buying us their way to heaven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Okay.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:15]** Fair.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** Love it.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Love it.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:20]** It is the top of what would be round four.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Nico is stable.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:30]** And Lozu looks at you here and says, please, I need to help the captain.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:30]** Can you help?

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** Please, just one sec.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:43]** And then pulls out a healing serum and turns to the captain and stabs the captain in the neck and injects the captain with a healing serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:43 - 00:34:03]** serum and i believe that brings us out of turn order as both rameem and nico are stable what do you all want to do stand up and because he's kind of crouched down behind the wall and he stands up and he looks around he says are are we all clear are there any more hostiles


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** We're all clear.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:09]** I think it was only Jinchiroga who came in.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:13]** Grath starts to run up towards Lozu.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:17]** And here, as you can hear, Grath being like, Lozu, can I get one of those?

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Can I get one of those?

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:24]** And she hands Grath one of the, what do you call it, Mark I healing serums.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** Grath starts to walk away towards Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:36]** Has his rifle out and he walks over to Gingeroga and he just kind of steps onto her shoulder and keeps his gun trained on her.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:39]** Interesting.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** Grath.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:43]** Runs over while we're waiting.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** Steps past Dr. O.K.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** Bends down.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:51]** Shoves the Mark I healing serum into Nico's neck.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:56]** Nico, you get 1d8 hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** Get a d8 and see how many points I get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** Well, I'll roll it.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** It's a 4.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** You get 4.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** You get 4 hit points.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** Dr.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** O.K.,

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** Can I say anything as I'm revived or no?

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:10]** Yes, but give me one sec.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** This is important.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** Dr.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:15]** O.K., you're probably the closest to Nico.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:32]** As Nico gets stabbed and as Grath pulls out this Mark I healing serum, you kind of start to see that for some reason...

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:56]** there's something about the healing serum that seems familiar and you look and written in big letters on the side of the injector is the word diorama give me a wisdom check doctor okay what was like what kind of just roll a d20 and add your wisdom


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:59 - 00:35:59]** That's a 20.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** Nice.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** 19 on the die.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:08]** You see that font, and you see that name, and you're like, I have seen that name somewhere before.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** Diorama, diorama.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:26]** And in your head, you realize that on some of the boxes, when you were on the planet with Dr. Brustakis, some of the boxes had the word, same font, diorama on them.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:32]** And then you kind of snap out of it, and Nico is waking up.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:35]** Nico, what do you say as you wake up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:35]** I look over there.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:41]** I look over at Graf and Dr. Okay, and I'm like, why is everybody staring over at me?

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:45]** Again, it kind of felt back a little bit, but what happened?

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:48]** I just saw some lady going on a stairway.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** It didn't make much sense to me.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:53]** You do realize what happened, right, Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** I'm sorry.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:57]** You went down.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:02]** I mean, Jin Chiroga went down right after you, but you went down.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:05]** It seemed like you were close to death.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:08]** saved you, and I just managed to get you the serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Wow.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** I owe you a drink.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** I owe you a good scotch.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** How about both of you guys a good scotch?

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:15]** Can I roll a sense motive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** On who?

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:16]** Graf?

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** Graf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:20]** Always.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:26]** That is 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:31]** Yeah, Grath seems like he's happy that he was able to wake Nico up.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** He seems happy, relieved.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** Seems like he keeps his cool in combat.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:40]** It's probably not his first time with a conflict like this.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:45]** Certainly not as shaken as Lozu was, as Rick could see before.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:48]** But yeah, seems pretty altruistic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:49]** Yeah, go ahead, Nick.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:53]** John, can I roll a diplomacy check so that Grath might...

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** So I guess what I'm trying to do is this.

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:05]** I'm trying to roll a diplomacy check to add a degree of sincerity to Nico's words so that Graf feels that he's appreciated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** I'll say that you get it already.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:12]** Graf is actually concerned in making sure that you're okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:13]** Okay.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:13]** Okay.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** Where is Song during all of this?

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** Is he still around?

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:20]** If I recall... Are they still around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** They are back on the quarters before.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** They were cleaning up from what the goblins did before.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:26]** And if I recall, Dr. O.K.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:28]** had insulted Song and then was like, yeah, peace out.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** That's right.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:29]** I forgot.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:42]** So Lozu, I don't know, Rick, exactly what you're doing right now, but here is Lozu gives Captain Rameem, and you see Captain Rameem kind of...

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:50]** eyes so closed start to kind of roll around and Lozu stands up and turns to you here and says

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:54]** Thank you so much.

**[00:38:56 - 00:39:02]** Seeing you all at the door there, I think we would have died if you hadn't come to help.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** Thank you.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:06]** Do you need any healing?

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:12]** And she pulls in and she has two other healing serums.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:16]** And she hands them and says, do you or does anyone else need anything?

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:20]** I think the captain's okay now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:27]** Well, if she could restore my actual HP, because that's what I need instead of stamina, then yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:29]** Yeah, here, just stop off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:37]** I want to see, seeing graph, I want to see what Lozu is giving out.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:40]** Can I just sort of walk up just to hear?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:43]** Yeah, sure, that's fine.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:49]** Nico is also going to raise his hand over to Lozu as well for a healing potion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** You probably didn't hear that, Nico.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:53]** Probably not.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:54]** Dr.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** O.K., you might have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:57]** I'm super suspicious of Lozu.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:03]** So he's going to do just a quick medicine check on the Chinjaroga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** To make sure it's actually dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** Here's you.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:12]** You got six hit points back from that.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** Why, thank you.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:14]** Sure.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Yeah.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Thank you.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:18]** I can't tell you how much.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** Yeah, I thought I was going to die.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** I thought I was going to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** Thanks a lot.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:28]** The rest of the crew, the rest of my guys could probably use some help too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:34]** John, I'm wondering if I see the diorama on the same healing serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** You do.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:38]** Before we get to that, Rick, you said you were doing a medicine check.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** You're trained in medicine or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** I am now.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** Hey, level two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** That's what happens when you get level two.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** You can be trained in anything you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:53]** So I rolled a nine for medicine and I just want to see if it's still alive or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** She is dead.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:59]** The rest of her body has continued to transform.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:04]** During that time, by the time that she had charged Nico, she was mostly transformed.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:15]** But you can see just the fur, the tail, just this huge canine hulking creature that was also a hobgoblin and is now in its true form as a bar guest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:20]** Nico is kind of, as Nico sees us, Nico's kind of hitting himself on the head.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:24]** He's just like, Lozu didn't send us to that room.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** The bark has sent us there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** Not convinced that is the case.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:34]** Well, plenty of things suspicious about Lozu.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** She is not to be trusted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:46]** I'm not saying she's one to be trusted, but seeing as though we saw Gingeroga in that kind of weird state, she could have just finished transforming.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:56]** into Lozu after seeing her once and sent us into a trap, not expecting us to come back and overcharging the frozen artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:00]** This creature has ability to shapeshift or just into this creature and back?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:03]** Somebody give me another life science check on this.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:06]** I thought you said they could shapeshift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** I don't have life science.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** Who am I doing life science on?

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:09]** Lozu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:10]** Jin Chiroga.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** I think.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** Non-life science.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:18]** Because it's dead.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** Opposite of life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** Okay.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** Dead science.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:26]** I rolled a 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:26]** Yeah.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** So you know that... Yes.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** Here's what I'll tell you that you know, and then we'll get to what happens.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** You know that Jinchiroga is a bar guest.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:40]** They are extraplanar evil shape changers, but they can only change.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** They have two forms.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:46]** They have one specific goblinoid form and one specific wolf form.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:50]** You rolled so well that you know that these creatures are the masters of deception.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:54]** They can change at will between either of them.

**[00:42:54 - 00:43:05]** They use these forms to stay beneath notice, travel incognito, and they are all about trying to deceive in order to gain power.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:12]** Both figuratively and physically, you realize that given the creature's…

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:32]** jaw configuration the bone structure looking at the stomach looking at the way that the creature and you kind of think about how does this creature metabolize do you realize this creature can devour corpses at a full round action and metabolize corpses and literally grow stronger

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** Maybe you've heard about this before.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:42]** You've heard of Barkas who are double the size of this one because they have literally devoured enemies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** I have to fight more of these things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:47]** So I will relay this information to the group.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:50]** But what I want to know is what I...

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:59]** Be able to perform like a life science check on somebody that I'm within melee range or grasping range.

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** Sure.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** To see if like they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:06]** I mean, you can't take their blood, but you would essentially be doing like a knowledge life science.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:09]** To try and identify or see what they are.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:14]** Lozu at that point comes up to you and says, Dr. Kate, are you okay?

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** Do you need any healing?

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** And she holds out one of the diorama serums.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** Yes, may I borrow this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:22]** Yeah, please, please, here.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** And then hands it to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** Knows that this thing is dead.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:33]** He's going to strap this other gun to the same strap as his artillery laser rifle.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:35]** Since he's encumbered anyways, he's going to walk slow.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:38]** But he's going to walk up to Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:51]** He's, he's not very good at this, but he's going to look at her and just like as non-aggressively as possible, even though he's furious or with trust a neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:55]** I put him in his room.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:58]** He should still be in his room.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** Is Algiada?

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** I don't know.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** Have you found anything out?

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:08]** Thank you for coming to save us.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** Sorry, there's a lot going on right now.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** I don't know where Algiada is.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:16]** That's part of why I asked you to help.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Sorry.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** Do you need healing?

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:21]** By the way, I just gave something to Dr. Okay.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** But yeah, I don't know where Algiata is.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:27]** Did you find anything in her room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:29]** Since motive...

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** 13 minus 1 for 12.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** On what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** She seems like she's really flustered.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:45]** Like she's trying to take everything in, center herself, answer all of your questions, hoping the captain is okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:53]** He pulls back his trench coat and shows the cryo pistol, or the cryo rifle strapped next to the artillery cannon.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:56]** It says, we found this rigged as a trap.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** It actually hit our friend here.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** And points back at Nico.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:01]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:04]** Nico, are you okay?

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** You were hit by this?

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** This hit me.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:09]** I don't think it was your fault.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:12]** I hope it wasn't your fault, Rick.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:16]** And she kind of reaches back and gingerly touches the area where she was hit by it.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:19]** Nico, are you okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** I'm all right.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:23]** I'm a little bit better.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:28]** Saw some lady in a stairway for a couple minutes, but I'm back amongst living.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:32]** I could use a health potion if you got anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** I gave one to Dr.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** O.K., and she kind of looks around.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** She sees Dr. O.K.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** walking over to Captain Rameem.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** Dr.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:45]** O.K., real quick, Captain Rameem has kind of started to sit himself up and lean a little bit against the back of the captain's chair there.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:52]** Um, Grath walks over to Nico and just kind of taps Nico on the leg and just says, you'll be, you'll be all right.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:56]** That was close, but, uh, we're not in the business of letting people down here.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:59]** So you'll be okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:03]** I really wouldn't say that, but, uh, you did all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:26]** here's you you hear this from like 20 feet away graph guy at least you didn't say rat guy this time i hope that's even though it's been funny i feel like this is appropriate and respectful to him graph didn't hear that because he's like 20 feet away so he just didn't oh okay well i telepathically throw it at him i thought he was talking to me


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:28]** No, he's over here.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Grath came over to talk to Nico.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:32]** He was talking to Nico and said, you're going to be okay.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:32]** Yeah.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:32]** Okay.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:36]** So right now, Captain Vermeem is still slumped against the center of the room.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** Dr. O'Kay sitting next to him.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:43]** Here's close by Lozu, Rick, Grath, Nico, all standing close to the door talking.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** Who is doing what?

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** Nico's going to walk in.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** I shouldn't have said it like that.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** Let's go one by one.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** Who is going to go?

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:58]** Let's start with... Nico and I are going to do the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:58]** Okay.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** We're going to both approach.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:07]** Rick kind of just looks at Lozu, like half shakes his head, and then walks past her towards Captain Rumi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:08]** Okay.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:13]** Grath starts to walk in behind, and Lozu and Grath start to talk a little bit.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** And you all are walking up to the captain?

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** Correct.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:18]** Okay.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:23]** What do you say as you walk up to the captain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** What did he want?

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** What did she want?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:32]** He kind of starts to rub his head, blink.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** I'm so sorry.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** I'm so sorry.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:43]** That was the most intense action that I've seen in a while.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:46]** I don't know.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** Sorry.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:54]** And you can see that some of the blood has stopped because of the booster from Dr. O.K.

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:08]** I think that with Algiata's disappearance, that creature probably saw her chance to take our ship and our cargo away.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** He kind of starts to rub his temples.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** You know why?

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:21]** I took a big risk allowing those goblinoids on my ship, but they're credits.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:28]** They spend like anyone else's, so I've never had issues like this in the past.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:37]** It may not seem like it, but I don't believe the hobgoblin and the goblins are the biggest concern currently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:44]** So you think that there's something more going on?

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:47]** I think... Sorry, I thought I had heard something...

**[00:49:47 - 00:50:17]** about um about lozu had asked you all for some help in in finding algiata so you're saying from what you found that that this is not the biggest concern somebody something trying to take our bridge pad that has the information oh the reveal that um yeah that's here okay dr okay um

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:48]** does yeah can i like you want to roll sense of all this do i sense yeah yeah sure go ahead uh 17 seems like he's flustered telling the truth uh okay yeah he's just trying to get his whereabouts doesn't seem you know before he was like hey how are you welcome to camera and now he is very much like very low-key trying to recover how are you feeling captain or me

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:49]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:57]** I'm, you know, I'm, well, this is not my first time coming close to death, but thank you.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** Thank you.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:01]** I think with Lozu's help here, I was able to get a serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:04]** I might need to rest a little.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:07]** Quite a great serum you've got here.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** I've taken a look at it.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:10]** Thank you.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:19]** Where would a doctor such as myself find such a fabulous serum to purchase, perhaps?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:23]** Oh, this seems to be pretty standard.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** I don't make these purchases.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** Who stocks this ship?

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:34]** It's part of the restocking that we get, I think, you know, typically Lozu or Algiata.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:35]** I'm sorry.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** I'm happy to talk about this more.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:43]** But, Rick, you were saying something about a threat to the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:51]** A cryptic message that suggested something was going to happen to this ship and yourself by the time we return back to the Pact Worlds.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:51]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:55]** Relationship with security officer Al Jetta.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:59]** I mean, I trust her.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** I've trusted her for a long time.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** Sorry.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:07]** You're saying that the ship is in danger or I am in danger?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** I rolled a 14 on a sense motive there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:09]** Yeah.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:12]** He, once again, seems like he's trying to wrap his head around what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:16]** He's going to look over at Hears and kind of put his hand out.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Hears is listening to this, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** Yeah.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:23]** He'll say, like, do you have the data pad?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** Oh, I got it right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** And just kind of pants it to him.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** So you've got the data pad.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** Good chuckles.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:34]** I also put the map in all of your journals by the way you should have those.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Have on the data pad or that's separate?

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** No, it's separate.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:37]** The pillowcase map.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** I was going to wait.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** The pillowcase map looks interesting.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:43]** And there's a couple of spots right outside this room that we should look into.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** For sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** But let's get to that in a second.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:48]** So you show the data pad to Captain Romain.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:50]** Okay.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** Was that a question?

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** That was a question.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** Yeah.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** It sounded like a statement.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:54]** No, no, no.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:54]** No.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** Okay.

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:03]** My, my, uh, this is, uh, I, I can't imagine why Algiata would do this.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:07]** You're showing the, the thread of communication, like the emails, right?

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:14]** As, you know, whatever, from... Uncle R, the contact from Maro.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** Okay.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:19]** Yeah, he's like, this is troubling.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:23]** I've trusted Algiada, and I don't know why she would do this.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** I...

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:28]** I assure you, I had no idea about this.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:32]** I wouldn't keep her on the roster if I did.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:39]** Tough customer or not, no matter what's going on, I would not keep someone like that on board.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** There is more.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** What more?

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:46]** Do you know the professor that is on board?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:49]** The Professor.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:50]** Yes.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Benjam, yes.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:57]** And Trostenec, I think you're saying, correct?

**[00:53:58 - 00:53:58]** Yeah.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:06]** You know, before I think you came in, Ginger Ogre mentioned something about the Professor, but I can't remember what.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:14]** You think that they are a bigger threat here than Ginger Ogre was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** There is something going on.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** I'm not quite sure what that is, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:20]** What happened with Jincharoga's goblins?

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** It wasn't just her, right?

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:27]** There were more people that had booked passage than just her, the hobgoblin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:36]** Nico's going to kind of chuckle and kind of do a smart comment behind the back of...

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:43]** Rick, Tahir's, and he's going to say, clean up on aisle 12 for the goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:49]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** I'm going to need to rest soon.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** We're taken care of.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** Okay.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:54]** All right.

**[00:54:54 - 00:55:01]** So there's no present danger, although it sounds like there was something when we return, it seems like.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:06]** There's danger when we get into Absalom, there's going to be some danger, correct?

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:15]** The Truskeneck and Algiada did in some way.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** We overheard them speaking of some plan.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:20]** Huh.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:23]** Some plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:28]** I am not certain if Algiada's disappearance is of her own doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** Perhaps there are more of these.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** What are they called again?

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:34]** Bar-keeks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:37]** Bar-kests?

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** Bar-keeps?

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:41]** Bar-backs?

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:44]** Hey, do you need some more goose?

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:45]** Wild turkey?

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:47]** Okay.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** Shape changers, right?

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** Shape changers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:52]** Okay.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:56]** There may also be a connection between Algiata and the Professor.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:01]** Okay, it seems like there's a lot.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:03]** I'm sorry, this is a lot.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:05]** I'm going to need to rest soon here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** Rick, if I may here, can I cut in?

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:11]** Captain, I know this is all very overwhelming for you.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:14]** maybe we could just learn a little bit more about the ship here.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Can you tell me how you came in?

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:19]** Can you tell us a little bit how you came into possession of the ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:29]** Uh, the ship, I've had this ship for a while, you know, uh, I think it's a while, uh, at least 10 years.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:31]** I've been making runs for a while.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:38]** Nico wants to do a sense motive on just about anything he's saying in this.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:41]** He wants to know whether or not he's going to be lying about anything in this story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:44]** It's not a lie detector test, but I'll tell you what you see.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** It's a 22.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:49]** 22.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:53]** He seems like he's trying to – he's like a little taken back by this line of questioning.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:57]** It's like a little like, okay, like we're really going back now.

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:01]** But he's happy to answer, yeah.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:06]** About 10 years ago, I saved up from some previous work that I was doing and I had an idea.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:10]** I wanted to start business myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:12]** I'm sorry.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:16]** Did you ever do any modifications to the ship, such as the hulls or the hull plating?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** No, I did not.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:25]** I mean, this is... Just been trying to keep her up, you know, with people like Keeve and... Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:26]** And...

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:32]** Our previous knowledge of this ship based on the name that we saw.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** The Star Dream 2?

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** Yeah.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:39]** That was longer than, say, 10 years, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Presumably, yeah.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:43]** That name recalls a ship that was longer than 10 years ago.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:46]** Yeah, I've had this ship for about 10 years.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** I'm sorry.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:49]** Is there a point to this?

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:58]** I am mostly concerned about myself, my crew, you all, and I'm going to need to step away for a second.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** I understand, Captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** Rick... I understand, Captain.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:06]** It's probably nothing.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** I'm just following up on everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** Sure.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:08]** No, no.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:09]** I...

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:15]** Like I said, Lozu has said that you all have been tasked to help out.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:17]** I trust her and I trust you.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:22]** I'm going to need to start to take a breather here.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:24]** And he starts to try and stand up.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** And then Lozu and Grath rush over.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** They're trying to help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:29]** Rick will reach down and help him.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** Okay.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:42]** So he starts to stand up and then he basically looks over and says, look, it sounds like there could be some danger, Rick, when we get back.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:46]** For now, you mentioned Trostenec, you mentioned the professor.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:50]** I think Lozu had said something about Trostenec.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Lozu, what was that?

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:54]** Yeah, he's in his quarters.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:58]** He's going to be in his quarters until we get to Absalom.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** All right.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:01]** Rick, one second.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:03]** I just have to say real quick.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:07]** I think the best thing to do, talk to the professor, find out this connection.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** Sounds like Trostenec will be safe.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:12]** Sounds like you all might need a breather.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:14]** I think we all need a breather.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:16]** So...

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:18]** I think we'll be all right.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** Lozu, I'm going to leave you in charge here.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:22]** Grath, do you mind helping me to my room?

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:26]** And then thank you all again.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** I can't tell you.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** Thank you so much.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:35]** Everyone give me a perception check.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:35]** 17.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:35]** 18.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** 18.

**[00:59:38 - 01:00:02]** 15 15 that's a 14 14 okay um you can tell that graph is like a little shocked that he that captain ramim is asking him to go um but he then he kind of quickly is like okay and lozu looks a little nervous because he says lozu you you just watch the ship for a few graph will be back momentarily just uh

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:37]** So thank you for helping.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** I think we're all a little safer.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** Thanks to you all.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:40]** Appreciate it.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** And they leave.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** Peace.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:47]** Anybody right now.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:50]** And Lozu is on board.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:52]** Thank you all.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:54]** I think, Rick, you wanted to talk to me.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:58]** You said something.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:16]** trust him Nick call out Keeve what do you know about that man person about Keeve well Keeve and I are friends you can tell she's a little nervous

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:17]** We're friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** Natural 20.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** So that's a 19 for sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:26]** Yeah, she seems like she's hesitant to share her relationship with Keeve.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:32]** Yeah, we're close.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:35]** But they're great.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:37]** They're really great.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:39]** They're a really special person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:43]** Nico's going to follow up and he's like, do I sense a romance here?

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:46]** And he's going to roll a sense motive on her answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** And she kind of sighs.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:49]** What's your sense of motive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:55]** I've got side theories floating around in my head about what's going on.

**[01:01:56 - 01:02:01]** And my newest thought is that Keeve isn't what we think they are.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:06]** And that Lozu is actually a genuine person.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:09]** And that Keeve has been manipulating Lozu.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:12]** It's theory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** Thoughts?

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:15]** Interesting.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:17]** Interesting theory.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** We'll see where the story leads.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:24]** I'm more inclined to think that there's something to do with the Star Dreamer or Star Princess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:27]** The Star Dreamer is still in play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:27]** Star Dream 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:40]** What I'm saying is Lozu's not a part of it, that Lozu's being played, and that makes sense that she was walking out in the hallway very strangely if Keeve sent her off or has some kind of sway over her


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** Do you think it's magical in nature?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:46]** That's what I'm saying.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:53]** I think we're going to run into Keeve and he's going to, or they're going to turn into Hobgoblin something or other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:54]** I don't know, man.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** I just don't know.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:57]** Nico, what was your sense motive on her answer?

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:00]** Uh, 16 plus four, 20.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:03]** Look, I, and she kind of puts her heads in her hand.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:06]** I, this is all new to me.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:17]** Um, they've, they've been really wonderful and I, I am very happy that they're bored and yeah, we might, we might be more than friends.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:19]** Please keep this to yourself.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:21]** I don't think the captain knows.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:22]** I don't think it would be good.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:25]** I'm trying to be the best first mate that I can.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:31]** And you can tell she's letting her guard down a little bit because of the fact that you all semi-saved her life.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:34]** Because she really thought that she was going to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:37]** Nico's going to look back and say, no worries.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** Secret's safe for me.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:45]** It's not really something that even needs to be a secret, but I understand someone in your position wanting to keep that on the down low.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:46]** So we'll go ahead.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** We'll keep that a secret.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** Thank you.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:49]** That being said,

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:52]** There's some strange things going on here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** Yeah.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:57]** Have you all found out anything about Algiata?

**[01:03:57 - 01:04:01]** I mean, now we have to deal with this Barkest or thing, body.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:04]** That was John saying Barkest, not Lozu.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:06]** This body.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:10]** Have you found out anything about Algiata from her room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:16]** Well, Lozu, it's kind of interesting you bring that up because we went to the room.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:21]** And there was a trap that was rigged to shoot me.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** Yeah.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:22]** I'm so sorry.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:24]** And he's rolling a sense motive.

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:26]** He's going to roll a sense motive on her response to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:28]** Here's Dr. Okay.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:30]** Rick, what are you all thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** I want to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:34]** It's a 23.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:56]** lose you if i may if i could ask her a couple questions okay we'll respond to nico and then we'll go to dr okay i i hear um one sec here's i i i nico you asked about the trap that is horrifying there's never been a trap like that before i don't even know how someone would do that uh

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** And she seems very genuine.

**[01:04:57 - 01:05:02]** She's like blown away that there was a trap and that it was going to rig.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:04]** I could have opened the door.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:07]** I guess I could have been the one to get hit.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** I'm sorry that it was you.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:10]** It should have been me.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:11]** I'm the crew.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:12]** This is my responsibility.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:18]** And I feel like I failed you because now I've put you all in harm's way, not once, but twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:25]** This is like the 27th apology of a crew member of this ship.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:27]** about things going wrong as they constantly are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:29]** So, Dr.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:32]** O.K., you were going to ask something, then Hears were going to ask something, and then Lozu was going to say something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:41]** Yeah, I wanted to ask, see, Lozu, I wondered if you could tell me more about these serums.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:47]** The diorama, yeah, they're fantastic.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:49]** We always get them whenever we come into any port.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:50]** They always seem to come in.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:54]** They're just the healing serums that we have standard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:58]** Where was this particular one issued, I suppose?

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:00]** Did you get it on the station?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:06]** Yeah, the last time that we stocked up was probably Legacy Station, so it's probably there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:08]** I see.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:12]** And who's in charge of that purchase?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:14]** Sometimes it's me, sometimes it's Algiata.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:18]** I think this time it was Algiata.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:28]** And she kind of, like, turns the captain's chair and, like, sits on the handle a little bit and kind of, like, makes sure she doesn't hit any buttons and cause, like, the entertainment screen to come down or something, you know?

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:32]** She's like, oh, yeah, I think it was Algiata this past time.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:36]** Not to bring it back, but is everyone okay?

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** I think...

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:41]** I have to stay on duty, but I want to make sure that you guys are okay.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:43]** I think Hears you had a question, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:53]** Hears doesn't have a question for Lozu, but just telepathically tells the team, like, don't mention anything about the map.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:56]** That's for us only.

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:58]** Because he thought someone might have mentioned it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:58 - 01:06:59]** How does your telepathy work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:01]** By the way, I'm telepathic.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:04]** I probably should add that so it doesn't completely throw them for a loop.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:12]** Well, it just communicates instantly mentally with any creature in range.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:14]** It's from my race, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:19]** Thanks for getting in my head.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:19]** Okay.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:20]** By the way, I'm telepathic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:22]** Sharon.


## Speaker_0

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:23]** I'm talking to your head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:27]** Nico looks over and hears again and nods and laughs and Sharon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:31]** Rick, Rick asked Lozu one, like, I have one last question.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:32]** Yeah.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:33]** How long have you known Keeve?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:40]** Uh, Keeve, I came on since they came on, uh, in the past year or so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:43]** Nico follows up with that.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:45]** What do you know of Keeve?

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:47]** Like, can you describe it for me?

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:48]** Like what motivates him?

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:51]** Like, you say everybody on here is a nice guy.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:53]** What have they done to really show you that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:57]** Keith always is very bright.

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:59]** They always have a lot of energy.

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:02]** They always try and cheer everyone up.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:06]** Lately, I think...

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:12]** Well, as of last night, they haven't been doing well, but I haven't talked to them.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:15]** So I'm not quite sure.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:18]** But they've always just been fantastic.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:19]** They're so brilliant.

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:24]** They're always able to fix anything, no matter how hard they have to work.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:28]** And they're always just such a bright spot in my day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:31]** Do you know who Keeves is making money for?

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:36]** Is it for him to pay off debt or has he talked to you at all over dinner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:47]** I think they're making money for their family back on Murata, I think.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:49]** I don't know.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:53]** Sorry, I'm starting to get a little frazzled here and I have to remain on duty.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:56]** These are a lot of questions.

**[01:08:56 - 01:09:25]** understand yeah I unless there's any more questions I it sounds like Captain Rameem is probably the he told you to ask about the professor so might be good to talk to the professor did did you go to help Keeve at all or maybe you haven't gotten to that yet to keep probing but he's got no more questions that are useful does anybody want to give me a wisdom check and I'll give you something oh

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:49]** zero but i'll roll 21 i'm trying to help you guys out a little bit because things i got 16 21 i got 19 19 21 16 19 who who had the data pad from algae out of his room uh he just did here's i'm assuming you had everything from algae out of his room right you had that and the ledger and the photo and everything

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:51]** Yes.

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:51]** Yeah, I think so.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:53]** Here's maybe you.

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:57]** Dr. O.K.

**[01:09:58 - 01:10:00]** and Nico, you think of this too.

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:05]** You're like, Lozu's name was on that account ledger from...

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:32]** guilty and here's you're kind of like getting ready to go you're kind of patting down and you feel the account ledger and it reminds you that there's that account ledger that said for lp ship repairs um from algiata lozupa here yes yes dang yeah and it has a circle get to be paid looks like yeah i knew she was guilty why why would no sense motive show this though


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:36]** She might be being manipulated, as you say, or as was said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:41]** Or her name was forged on the... Yeah, or I like where Kelly's going with it.

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:44]** Or her name might have been forged on the document.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:51]** I don't know if he would have called it.

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:54]** I guess because he didn't make the connection between LP and... Right.

**[01:10:55 - 01:11:01]** So... Yeah, he brings this up, and it'll click in his head, and he'll...

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:30]** sounds like here's telepathically says you know i think lp on that ledger is probably lozu we have the ledger i got it right here rick will ask her did you have anything to do with this ledger and he just he doesn't make any comment about it like he doesn't tell her like look at this lp but he he just shows her the ledger

## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:54]** So we're going to have to roll either a diplomacy check or John's insinuating that Lozu is intimidated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:59]** She looks at you and then

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:05]** She just starts to sob.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:14]** Wow.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:23]** There are still others at hand.
