**[00:00:00 - 00:00:10]** Last time on We'll Save, from action to thriller, Nico and Hears investigated a sound from the darkness.

**[00:00:11 - 00:00:19]** When they found the source, a bloodied statue, they discovered that the blood comes from the same race as the captain's.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:27]** After investigation, the group sliced into a secret door discovered by Rick 19 and Dr. O.K.

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:29]** What they found...

**[00:00:29 - 00:00:49]** was chilling captain ramine lied dead on the floor but didn't our adventurers just see the captain on the bridge tensions mount when the secret door his is open is this the killer find out this time on


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:46]** Speaking of music, besides the fact that Nick's clap was really late to start, we all clapped to start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** Is he messing with us on that one?

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** He might be.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:51]** It might just be latency problems.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** But Nick's a musician.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:54]** It was like two seconds late.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:54]** Yeah.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** But hey, you know what?

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:05]** You know what I really wanted to just drill down to was the fact, just wanted to show some of the music on our podcast, some love.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:10]** Just wanted to call out how some of this music comes about.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:14]** Obviously, some of it is from Syrinscape.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** Always lovely.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** Thank you.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** Always a pleasure.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:17]** Yes, thanks.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** Thank you.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** Yes.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** Thank you, Syrinscape.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:23]** Thank you very much for setting the mood.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:28]** It's almost as if that is exactly what you intended to do, and you did it.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:33]** Also, thank you to Audio Jungle and some of the creators on there.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:37]** That's where we pull some of this intro music from.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:46]** But then also, I'm going to give a shout out to our late clapper, Nick Belcher, for coming up with a lot of his music.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Every slow clap for him.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** Yeah, we'll all clap really at a time.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:58]** And Nick is really appreciating that right now for anyone who can't see, which is everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** It's lag, guys.

**[00:02:59 - 00:02:59]** It's lag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:02]** There's just lag in our system.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** Yeah.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:04]** So it's good.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:05]** But he's talented.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:10]** If Lag could be embodied in an animal right now on my end, it would be a sloth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** It would be a sloth.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:17]** But what's weird is that your voice, it seems like you're picking up on our conversation perfectly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** It's not on my end.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** It's on your guys' end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:24]** How did all four of us lined up?

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** Sorry, I can't count ever.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:30]** Four of us can line up, and one of us is always slow, and it's our fault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** I don't know.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:33]** I'm not the one who makes internet rules.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** You need to talk to somebody else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:39]** To our resident IT people, Kelly and Will.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** K-E-L-L-Y.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** That's exactly my role.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** We'll fix the clap delay bug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:53]** What we need to do is we all just need to get on a LAN with a closed system using a switch.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** That would eliminate it.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** But then at that point, I feel like... Kind of switch.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** Are we going fiber?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:02]** Are we doing, like... I wouldn't... Are we doing... I'd recommend... Are we doing LAN party?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Like, just 100?

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** We should do... We should just... Fiber optic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:11]** When we do in person, we should do, like, a LAN, like, all Ethernet direct into the switch.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:13]** Have a LAN party?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** Yeah, we'll just have a LAN party.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** We'll just hook up with Dante.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** We're all set.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:21]** I get to take over my house and my attic and all that stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:24]** And then people will just ask, do you record in person?

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:27]** And we'll be like, yes, all in the same house in different rooms over Zoom.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** And not together.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** And they'll be like, wow, that's so innovative.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]** I mean, that's how I used to play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:37]** I'm talking post-COVID, post-COVID, John.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** Post-post-COVID.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** I mean, that's how I used to play Call of Duty.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** Or not Call of Duty.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** Counter-Strike.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:42]** Counter-Strike.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** No.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** Counter-Strike?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** Yeah, Counter-Strike.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** Quake 2.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** Yeah.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:46]** Actually, Quake 2.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** I keep wanting to say Code Red.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** Command and Conquer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Unreal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** Command and Conquer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** This is dangerous.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:57]** I'm starting to get merit knowledge, and now I'm triggering the rest of everybody here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:57]** Yep.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:59]** Now we are all...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** Flashbacks to so much fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:14]** Um, you always have like a bunch of candy there Okay, my favorite thing about those land remember those when they like there's like a one year period where they'd have the land party like Stores that you would go.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:22]** Yeah sign up or login Yeah, get your own computer and you're in a room a dark room with a bunch of other nerds doing stuff on the computer We would have land parties where everybody in that room.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:27]** We'd be playing the same game of Counter-Strike

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:33]** And it was the best because, like, you'd shoot somebody that's, you know, doing really well, and you'd hear on the other side of the room, like, mother!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:38]** Classic.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** Net cafes.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** Internet cafes.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]** At some point, like, you'd hear, like, your mom in the back.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** You'd be like, hold on!

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** I can't pause a live game!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:47]** Hold on!

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** Wait!

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:53]** Well, no, the internet cafe is like, it was, you're sitting in rows with other players.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** If your mom comes with you to the net cafe, though.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:59]** She like comes back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:02]** Wow, did you just kill that person?

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:09]** The funniest thing that happened to me on an online game was I randomly came across in a PvP game on Destiny 2.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:14]** Came across one of my friends and I was getting ready to snipe this guy and I hesitated.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** I'm like, wait.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** Is that such and such?

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** And the person spotted me.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** He wasted no time.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** He just pulled the trigger.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** Oh, wow.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** They didn't know it was you.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** Or there's a secret grudge.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:29]** No, he knew it was me because he's messaged me right after.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** He's just like, ha, ha, ha, ha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:32]** Amazing.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** Amazing.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** You need better friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** That's why I have you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:41]** We would never do that to you.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** Unrelated transitions.

**[00:06:44 - 00:07:10]** since it's our 20th episode oh yeah as they say it's a big number for podcasting it's not i don't know why i said that it's 20 hours it's 20 hours i think it's 100 hours i heard is is when you can get like syndicated or like set for reruns and stuff right is that i don't know email us the lawyers yeah yeah or shoot us an email if you're a lawyer or if you're not

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:12]** Here's a question.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:30]** Last week, you all came about a large number of discoveries, including a seemingly murder weapon shaped like the Kasathan homeworld intergenerational weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:33]** I mean, I'm no detective, but that was the murder weapon.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:34]** Something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** Must be.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:37]** You have not done forensics on it yet?

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** Well, because here's the thing.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:47]** You then come across a secret compartment and a body of... That matched the murder weapon.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:50]** That did seem to match the murder weapon.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** It did make sense.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:54]** The divot in the back of the head, the trophy.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** I mean, I'm really good at clue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** Plus, it was Kasoth in blood.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** We knew that.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:00]** Or here's the blood from looking at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:06]** So we have the room, we have the weapon, we just need the suspect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:09]** You need the suspect, you need motivation, right?

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:13]** There's always means, motivation, and what's the other one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** Opportunity.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:14]** For what?

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:18]** No, for clue, you just need suspect, weapon, and room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:18]** That's true.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** Well, but here's the thing.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** You come in, there's the body.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:29]** Three of you are exploring a secret access point in this chamber.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:29]** Okay.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:36]** And one of you is keeping watch.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:48]** When the door starts to open to the secret chamber.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** Who do you guys think it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:56]** Well, I wanted to ask before we jump back into our regularly scheduled story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** I have a theory.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** I have a theory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** That's what I'm interested in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:07]** So I kind of get the feeling that it's like a parasite that could be shape-shifting in nature.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:10]** Because we started this whole thing by killing bugs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:28]** So what if bugs are already loose on the ship prior to, and they've taken over the hosts and are now getting more people to... So I know we're not in-game right yet, but could you do a life science check to see if there are even creatures that do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:35]** I feel like you're just... Well, I think it was Dr. OK who did a life science check on...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:39]** No, but I mean like a general life science check of like what creatures do we know?

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:47]** Out of all my studies, I know there are six different characters or creatures that can do shapeshifting of any kind or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** I think Dr. O.K.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:48]** did that.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** I narrowed it down a bit.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** And that can kind of squeeze, right?

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** Can compress.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:59]** And you did recall that there were a handful.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** Not quite sure though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** How many of those were parasites?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:09]** Yeah, I was like, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** That's my thought.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** Those things clamped down pretty hard, and we didn't get to the end stage.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** We do know they died in acid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** How compressible?

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** How small are we talking?

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:22]** A cup of water?

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:23]** Beer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:28]** Water is essentially incompressible, so it wouldn't be water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** No, but what's the smallest?

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:32]** Maybe that size there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:36]** When he says compressible, he means it's probably a full-sized creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:44]** Clearly, there was some ooze inside the vent that you all found underneath Algiana's bed.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** And that is what led you to believe.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** It was acidic in nature, right?

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** It's a fucking brain slug.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** I don't think it was necessarily acidic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** Sorry.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** We found out, correct.

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:01]** The space lice don't emit or create any slime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:17]** I don't know that you rolled a life science check, but I would say that you could recall that the caustic remains of a space louse or an asteroid louse doesn't quite seem to be the same consistency or makeup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:25]** And space louse don't have any kind of transformative ability that we recall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** True.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:33]** Okay, so we got the bug, you know, pestilence theory.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** Is there anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:39]** I think that's a good question of, like, who is going to walk through this door right now?

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:44]** And the possibilities are pretty much anybody who we've seen on this ship.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** I think it's Raph.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:46]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:47]** I think it's Raph.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** Raph?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** I also think that, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:54]** Yeah, I don't know if I'm sold on that one.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** Something, something.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:56]** What if he just didn't know?

**[00:11:56 - 00:12:00]** What if he walked the captain back to the... That's not the captain.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:03]** Well, Graff didn't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:07]** We have to assume at this point that that's the real captain.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:12]** Graff walked back with the fake captain alone by himself.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:20]** Perfect opportunity for him to be either infected, killed, or possessed by whatever he walked back to that cabin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** Yeah, it could be the fake captain.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** At least there was a fake captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:32]** Grath did walk back as you all were leaving the bridge after confronting Lozu about her gambling issue.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:37]** Then Grath did come back in as you all were leaving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Yeah, and that's what I'm saying.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:43]** I don't necessarily think Grath... You're trying to say Grath is the shapeshifter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:46]** I'm trying to say Grath is a shapeshifter.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:51]** I still think that there are multiple shapeshifters and that they take control of their hosts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** So that's something we know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:57]** We know certainly it was the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** We know that's not the case.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:05]** We know that they are taking the shape of somebody else, but they're not taking the body of that person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:11]** Which means we will have to find the body of Graff at some point, but we found the body of the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** That's if Graff is dead.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:20]** There's no evidence either for or against Graff being one of these creatures.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** That's all I'm saying.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:24]** Go ahead.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:25]** Yeah.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:25]** Speculation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** Objection.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** Speculation.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:30]** Well, we more or less ruled out Lozu.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:35]** She's still kind of suspicious, but it doesn't seem like she is aware.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** I don't know.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** Either she's being manipulated or she's not involved, but.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:50]** Well, I'm on the same page as you for that one, that Lozu is not a shapeshifter because a shapeshifter wouldn't know about her history of gambling addiction and all that other stuff.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:55]** Unless these shapeshifters have some kind of way of absorbing their memories, which that's just crazy talk.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:58]** This is sci-fi, not fiction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:01]** Yeah, that's where you're going to draw the line, not drift travel.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:04]** Crazy talk of inheriting memories.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** Outrageous.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** That would never make its way into Starfinder.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Yeah, impossible.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** Outlandish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:15]** So out of all the characters that we've run into so far on this ship, who do you think it is?

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** Who do I think is going to walk through that door right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** We have a vote for Graf.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** Possibly two votes for Graf.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** Two votes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** I think it's going to be the captain himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** The real captain or the fake captain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** Well, no, the real captain's dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Don't you, me.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:36]** I really like side note because you can use in any situation.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** It just depends on your inflection.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:41]** You know, you were like, I think the captain will come.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** Yeah, but you're not allowed to right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:43]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** You know the answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** Hold on.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:52]** Is the evidence circumstantial that we actually that the body that we found is the real captain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** Or, no, we verified that it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** Because it is Kasathan blood.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:03]** I think that was what, like, at least two players had said it was Kasathan blood, and the captain was a Kasathan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:09]** So, Jin Chiroga was... Jin Chiroga!

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** Jin Chiroga!

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Who is he with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** The Hobgoblin?

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** All we know, the Hobgoblin was with the goblins.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:18]** That's the only connection we know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:23]** And with the fake captain at one point and Lozu at the end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:23]** What do you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Well, I don't know.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** It depends on your definition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:28]** No, I mean like association with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:31]** Yeah, just the goblins as far as we know.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:34]** Although, honestly, who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** We saw Algiana.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:38]** It's inspiring.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:39]** Possibly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:41]** Before she vanished.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** With the vest.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** She could be a shapeshifter.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:48]** she could also be a shapeshifter.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:56]** I think my, which case what I think who might be coming through the door is a shapeshifter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:04]** But the only person we know is actually a shapeshifter is the captain.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** That's the only one we know for certain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Yeah.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:09]** Or whoever made themselves the captain.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** Yeah.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:14]** This is like,

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** Somebody taking notes on this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:20]** Anybody could be, like, they could look like anybody coming through that door.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:24]** We're not going to know until we roll some hella rolls on them to try to figure it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:26]** What about song?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:26]** Song stuff.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:28]** It could be disguised as anyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:31]** Song's got metal ports and gears to him.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:33]** He's like a sentient robot.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** That's an android, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:39]** An android is more than such as a sentient robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:43]** But do we know that they are actually composed of that?

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** Like when we see them in front of us?

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:47]** Like maybe they could be disguised as an android.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:50]** That's the thing.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:52]** We don't know anything about these ships.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:56]** Maybe they're governed by a wireless hub as opposed to an actual land switch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:58]** Wait, what are you going on about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:02]** Nick is just... This is far too much speculation.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:04]** John, just move the story forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** Wow.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:10]** So I have two calls for Graf, one call for the captain, another call for...

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:12]** Get the damn thing going.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** Rate of play.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** Rate of play.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:16]** Rate of play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** Just open the door.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** Oh, Will, you didn't say what you thought it would be, though.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** I think it's a shapeshifter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** That's a very general answer.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:27]** But is it a shapeshifter in its actual form?

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** Yeah, who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** Or a shapeshifter in a form of somebody else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:29]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:36]** I just love the gif we have in our Starfinder Theories chat on Slack.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:39]** It's literally Paul McCartney just turning his chair and it's like, who knows?


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:40]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:41]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:48]** Well, since one of you asked if we can move the story forward, I wasn't planning on it.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:50]** I thought we'd just chat the whole time about who it could be.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** The next episode, we'd open the door.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:53]** But I changed my mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** So we're not opening the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** No, we're going to open the door.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** We're going to close the door while we're going to go to bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:02]** Rewind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:03]** Start over.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** We're going to start over from the beginning.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:09]** And you all are in the docking bay of Legacy Station.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:17]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:19]** I think Rick is the only person who sees this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** We hear it, though, I thought.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** You did say that everybody else heard it, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** Can we see the map?

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** We don't see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** Classic.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:33]** As soon as I hear it, I want to try and cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:35]** The door opens.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:40]** Suffice to say that the lighting in here is still dim.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:48]** And as it opens, there's a set of bright light from out in the server bay.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:56]** And you see the tall outline of someone step through the doorway.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:04]** As they step through, you see the cargo bay lighting illuminate a vesk.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:10]** As Trostenec steps through, decked out in armor.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:14]** And some couple weapons on him.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:16]** Trostanek, I think, sees Rix.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** Can I roll a stealth?

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** Do you want to roll a stealth?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** Of course I want to roll a stealth.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** You didn't even ask me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:23]** Okay.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:25]** Because I thought that you weren't.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:29]** But then let's see what Trostanek sees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:35]** I got 10 plus 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** 11.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:38]** 10 plus 1.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:38]** 11.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:42]** Tristanek looks right at you.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:47]** Whoa, whoa, whoa.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:47]** Put that down.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:50]** I'm not here to get shot at.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:54]** Is that what you're doing here exactly?

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:54]** Shooting?

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:54]** Shooting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:12]** Rick is going to stand up then, since he's clearly seen, and he's going to step out around the boxes and slowly walk forward to this box and say, what are you doing in this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** Is Algiata here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:16]** You are not the one asking questions here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:18]** Put your weapons on the ground.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** Do you still have your weapon raised?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** Yes, of course.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:23]** It's trained on him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** Okay.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** Trostenec sees the captain.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:27]** Oh, sweet Vesk Prime.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** Is that the captain?

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** What did you do?

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** What happened here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:38]** Here's is going to roll a sense motive on him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** And here's you come out, right?

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:44]** And you're stepping out into plain sight.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** Okay.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:46]** Yeah.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** And that's a 20.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** Okay.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:49]** That's a 20.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:50]** Okay.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** Sorry, Nico, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:56]** Nico's going to roll a stealth roll, and he's going to... Nico's going to roll a stealth roll.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** Yeah, so that's what?

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:58]** And Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** O.K., you moved around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:03]** Are you... Yeah, I also wanted to sneak back and cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:05]** Okay, so Dr. O.K.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:11]** and Nico are stepping out and around the other side of the central pillar secret access area, trying to hide around the corner.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:15]** And here is rolling a sense motive.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Got a 20.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:16]** Dr.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** O.K., Nico, what did you all get?

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:19]** 16 for stealth.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** That's an 18 for stealth.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:21]** 18.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** Okay.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:26]** Nico, you can't see Trostenek.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:29]** Dr. Okay, from what you can see, it doesn't seem like he's noticed you.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:33]** Here's your sense motive.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** You got a 20.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:38]** That would probably give you...

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:49]** The sense that it seems odd that he's here, but he seems genuinely concerned about the captain and genuinely perplexed why you all are here.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** Can I answer my question, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:54]** Here's what are you all doing here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** What happened?

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** The question is, what are you doing here?

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** Rick, you're rolling a perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:06]** Yeah, I'm going to roll perception on like a very close perception of him to see if I recognize anything different from the trust neck we knew before.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** Can I say that?

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** Yeah.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** Does that make sense?

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:09]** It does make sense.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:12]** 17 play.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** 5 is 22.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:16]** 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:22]** You know, he seems nervous.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:29]** It looks similar for all intents and purposes, but something about him seems nervous.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:38]** Doesn't seem out of line from the Trostenec that you spoke with last time in the starboard cargo area.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:44]** I'm here because Algiata might be hiding here.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:44]** I...

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:50]** She told me about this secret compartment yesterday, but I only just came here to look.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** Why are you here?

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:54]** You still haven't answered my question, either of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** There are two things I have concern.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:59]** There are two things that I have concern about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** I can't understand both of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:07]** One, this is a secret compartment that you should not have knowledge of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:10]** I'm the one who's friends with the security chief.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:13]** I'm surprised that you have knowledge of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:17]** Where have you been the last 24 hours?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:25]** I've been on the ship, and then I was imprisoned by U4, and then I've been in my room.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:28]** I've been on the ship for the past 24 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:32]** And how did you get out of said room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:35]** Well, I was able to get out.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** I'm able to bypass the door.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:40]** I am a professional bounty hunter, you know.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:48]** And I heard the commotion on the bridge over the intercom, and when I showed up, everything was okay.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:54]** And then I remembered this compartment and thought I'd come look for Algiata.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:00]** Why would Algiata, the security officer, be hiding away in a crate or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** I don't know.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** I'm just as concerned as you are about her.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** You still haven't answered my question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** I do not buy any of this.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** Seems like bullshit.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:12]** What was your question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:17]** He says, you still haven't answered my question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** And what question was that?

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** Why are you here?

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:25]** We are investigating the death of the captain, and you are one of our prime suspects.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** Put down your weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:29]** I thought that you would be investigating Algiata.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** Put down your weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:34]** And as you say that, Shrastanek's face hardens.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:47]** And whatever surprised or meaningful look he has in his eyes fades and he levels his stare at Rick and at Hears.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:54]** He raises his hand and points to Rick and Hears.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** Curse you, meddlers.

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:04]** We were so close to pulling this thing off with minimal bloodshed, but you just couldn't let it go.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:14]** And I let you best me the first time, but I will not make the same mistake twice.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** I should have shot him.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:18]** And then he pulls out a pistol to shoot.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Wow.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:27]** I mean, he didn't learn his lesson the first time.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** I should have just shot on the seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:32]** He is thinking that he's going to best you now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:36]** I still don't know if he's a shapeshifter or not, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** I don't know.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:40]** Either way, he's trying to pull something he shouldn't be pulling.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:46]** He did just admit to something, and you all were, you pesky kids were getting in his way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** It was a pretty Scooby-Doo moment, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:51]** It was a Scooby-Doo moment, and I'm proud of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:54]** Let's take off his mask and see who he really is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:56]** Yoinks!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** Let's go around.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** Did anybody get above 20?

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:04]** I got at 20.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** At 20, okay.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** A dirty 20, yeah.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** Okay.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** Anybody from 15 to 19?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:11]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:15]** 17 from Yachter.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:16]** Okay.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** 10 to 14?

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:22]** No one.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** 5 to 9?

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** Me.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** 7.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** Oh, 7.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** That's right.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** You said 7 earlier.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:35]** And coming in at the caboose, just like his clap, at last.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** I deeply resent that comment.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** Well, that's fine.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:45]** You have a lot of time to think about it before it's your turn, and you can tell me what you think about it.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:48]** You'll get the same comment.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:53]** What's your initiative?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** One.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:56]** Wow.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** So it's going to be a three.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** Actually, it'd be a four technically, but natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:05]** I was like, how did you roll a one if that is the case?

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** All right.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** So I will say this.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:14]** Trostenek is unaware of Nico and Dr. OK.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:20]** So I am going to give both of you a surprise round in which you can act.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:24]** And you can either make a move action or a standard action.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:27]** So we're going to go in order in this surprise round.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:29]** So it's going to be Dr. OK first.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:32]** What would you like to do?

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:36]** Just for the listeners at home, Trostenec is about 10 to 15 feet in front of the door.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:38]** Rick is still standing behind a cargo net.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:42]** Hears is around the corner next to the secret access.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:47]** And Dr. OK and Nico are on the other side of the secret access entrance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:52]** Can I see Trostenec at this point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:56]** Yeah, you're standing in front of a low cargo container, maybe about three or four feet high.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** Some cover, I'll say.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** What would you like to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:11]** I'd like to shoot said trastanic with one of my few remaining inhibitors, pharmacological inhibitors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** Ooh.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** Ooh.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:16]** I should say that we should try to keep them alive.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:20]** Metagaming, perhaps, but we want to know as much as we can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:23]** How would hearsay that in-game, though?

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:26]** That sounds like hearsay.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** Hearsay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** Sounds like hearsay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:36]** GM can't get punishments.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:37]** That's false.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:39]** I get unlimited.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:43]** Let's keep this grubby little lizard alive.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:48]** Pharmalogical inhibitor from Dr. Okay.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** Technically not your turn.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** I'm sorry.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:52]** It's alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:57]** What's the bonus?

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** I think it's got to hit.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** What'd you get?

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** 16 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:05]** I'm just looking at 16 on the die against Casey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:06]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** Yeah, that's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** Nice.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:10]** So 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** That's with your cost of jet.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** Okay.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** So that's what your cost of jet injector.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:14]** Cool.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** So how does that look?

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:19]** I know it's not a blowgun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** Yeah, so Dr. O.K.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:26]** is just going to remove a small vial from his custom micro lab.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:28]** Sort of like a gelatinous.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:34]** Have you ever had those Korean rice pudding cakes?

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** No, but they sound good.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:36]** Like mochi?

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:38]** No.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** Okay.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:47]** Anyways, insert it into the costa jet liquidator and it will fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:51]** I'm going to say it's going to hit his leg because that's like the side.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:53]** It's right near you.

**[00:29:53 - 00:30:00]** So you'll need to... Fort save.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:03]** Fort... Fortitude save.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:07]** From old... Frosty.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** Not quite as good as a wolf save.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** Stay frosty, Frosty.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Not quite as good.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:14]** That is an 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** I think he stayed frosty with that one.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** Yeah, he stayed it.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** It's fine.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** He's good.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:24]** He also takes damage, so I'm going to roll for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** Yeah, what's the damage here?

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** Seven points.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** Wow, that's impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** Is he at the BTS?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:35]** So gets hit with six, six, six.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:35]** Okay.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:42]** So gets hit with this rice pudding injector that doesn't inject, but does probably hit an artery.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:46]** And you see his leg, you know, lose a little bit of support.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:53]** And he seems to kind of not stumble, but just kind of lean a bit more on his other leg.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:56]** Nico, what do you want to do with your move or standard action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:03]** John, so he still has the encumbered condition, but he doesn't also have the entangled condition from the inhibitor.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:06]** So he's encumbered, not entangled.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:09]** So it just affects really his movement speed.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** It also affects skill saves or something, doesn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** Yeah.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** Yeah.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** I'll read that.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** We'll make sure we're all good.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** It is Nico's surprise round.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:22]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:28]** Rules Court has been, has been, has been, whatever.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Rules Court is now in session.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** Yes, there it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** There it is.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** Rules Court is now in session.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** You found your stride.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:49]** The Whigs hereby put forth that it is permissible to wield both a pistol in one hand and a dueling sword in another.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:51]** Do the Tories say nay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** Nah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:55]** Rubble, rubble, rubble, rubble.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** Rubble, rubble, rubble.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** Can I have an objection?

**[00:31:59 - 00:31:59]** Yeah, what's up?

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:03]** It's not really an objection, but I was just going to read out encumbered.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:07]** All of your speeds are reduced by 10 feet.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:07]** Yes.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:12]** Your maximum dexterity bonus to your armor class is reduced to plus two.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:12]** Yeah.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:18]** You take a minus five penalty to strength and dexterity based checks.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:20]** Yeah.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:27]** Or, sorry, it looked like an F. Or you take your armor's check penalty, whichever is worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:29]** And Will, how long does that last again, by the way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:34]** I think it's equal to my key ability score.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** I was actually looking that up.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:36]** Okay.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:38]** I think it's like three or four rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:39]** Okay.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:41]** Let me know in a sec when you find it.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:46]** Nico, there's nothing wrong unless one of those weapons is a two-handed weapon, which I don't think either is.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:50]** Then I think you are allowed to wield both in each hand.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:57]** The question is, what did you have in your hand when this started, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:05]** So as you guys recall, I drew one of my pistols when I entered into the secret compartment prior to from last week.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Okay.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** So I still had that in hand.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:13]** Hearing the stuff that's getting ready to go down, Nico drew his dueling sword in the other.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** So that's your move action.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Yeah.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** What's your question?

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** Here's my follow-up question.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** Yeah.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:29]** The wigs doth put forward the notion that when using a pistol or sword, you are using them independently.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:32]** Therefore, the rules of multi-weapon fighting do not apply.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:33]** False.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:42]** That I will get my plus three bonus, seeing as though that I am not wielding or using said sword in the event of an attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:45]** But you're saying you're only going to use one or the other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:46]** Yeah.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:50]** When you're just using one or the other, that's fine.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:57]** But if you're going to use both during a full round action, then you will still take the same penalties.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:05]** So that's what I'm saying is that if I'm just using one while having the other one drawn but don't use it, I get my plus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:11]** It would be the same as if you didn't have anything.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** You're just using one of those as an attack.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:16]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:22]** At the same time, you could swing the sword for a minus three and then shoot the gun for a minus three.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:25]** Which would be zero.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:31]** I forget what feat it is, but there is a feat that says if you hit multiple targets, you get a bonus extra for each one or more damage or something.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:34]** There are benefits to doing something like that.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:47]** There's also, I think for the Blitz Soldier, there's a lot of skills that let you, if you do a range attack first and then a melee following that, you get a bonus on your melee, all these other.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:54]** So yes, there are definitely benefits to wielding both a long range and short range weapon or a melee weapon.


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:58]** Let's move out of the surprise round into round one.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** I want to get to some combat because I want to kill all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** Go back.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** I want to talk about more rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** That's my favorite part.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:05]** I have a rules update.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:07]** Rules update.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** Quick update.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** Rules update.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:16]** According to the character operations manual, the effect of an inhibitor lasts for a number of rounds equal to

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:37]** three plus your key ability score modifier minimum so how many round okay i believe my key ability score is intelligence okay yeah that's what you choose as a biohacker yeah plus four so seven rounds cool 30 nice yeah pretty uh pretty impressive is that what 42 seconds


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:42]** Okay, 42 seconds of being encumbered.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:44]** It is round one.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:47]** Rick19, what are you doing at the top of round one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:47]** All right.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:56]** So first thing Rick's going to do is shout to... According to the Vesk, presumably just here, because he doesn't know anybody else.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** Oh, I guess he knows Dr. O'Kayser now.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** But he's going to say, we need to seal this room again.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:04]** And then he's going to open fire.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** And so...

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:10]** Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:13]** I was going to ask how do I use punishments, but I just already rolled it.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** Yeah.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:17]** I rolled a one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:26]** These are the moments that I savor and I will listen back to as I'm going to sleep.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** Or when you all roll once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:30]** Even my wife laughed at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** Oh, see?

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** See?

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** That's how we all know.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** All right.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** I think it's time for the Paizo official.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** You really screwed my day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Critical fumble deck.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:43]** All right, you ready?

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** Oh, let me take these rules cards.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:46]** Bye, rules cards.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:47]** Here we go.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:49]** Three, two, tell me when to stop.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** I'm going to flip it in front of the screen.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** Okay, oh, you want the top card?

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** Yeah, let's take the top card.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Okay, top card.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** And that is what kind of a weapon again?

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** It is a...

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** It's a heavy weapon.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** Heavy wedding.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** Heavy wedding.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Heavy wedding?

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** It's a heavy wedding.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:05]** It's like the Red Wedding.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Wow.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** It got inside my armor.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:14]** You take half weapon damage each round for 1d4 rounds.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:15]** Ouch.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** What?

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:16]** Yeah, that sucks.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** That is bad.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:21]** Wait, you take that as damage?

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:25]** Yeah, you take half of your weapon damage each round for 1d4 rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Kev, are you really going to take that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** I mean, what can I do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** How does that work?

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** What happens to the weapon?

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:36]** Like, if he fires at somebody?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** It's like an electrical discharge.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** It's like shocking me back or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:41]** Yeah, and so you're going to take that damage for 1d4 rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:45]** So the enemy takes full damage and I take half of that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:47]** Well, if you hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Yeah.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** But you don't miss.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** You always roll for damage then.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:53]** Wait, what?

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:58]** So if he fires and misses, he still takes damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:05]** Yeah, so even if this doesn't stop you from doing anything, you're just going to take damage.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** And what is your bonus on a 1?

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** Because I think a 1 is an automatic miss.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Like you missed Trostenec.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Trostenec doesn't get hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** Yeah, my bonus is a plus 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Yeah, so you don't hit.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** And it's a miss anyway.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:18]** So I'm going to roll a d4.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** You roll your weapon damage.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** This thing's at 1d10.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** Dude, you lucked out.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** You got one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** Oh, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:28]** Let's get eight points of damage, so that's four points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:37]** Yeah, so as you try and fire, it must shock you, and something happens, and it, like, shocks your forearm, and the shock goes wild.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** goes wild, and you take four points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:42]** It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** It could have been way worse.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** It could have been so bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:47]** I was hoping for more than one round, but it's all right.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:48]** Dr. Roque, it's your turn.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:55]** Let's keep this combat going as you all are fighting somebody you weren't expecting in a secret compartment that you also weren't expecting.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** We're half expecting this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** I'm sure he, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:28]** sort of sees me at this point maybe it's a potential it's a possibility but you don't expect that the cost jet liquidator necessarily makes a lot of like noise yeah the two things i don't usually expect are that cost eject uh injectors make much noise and the spanish inquisition two things that i don't ever expect yeah so so what do you want to do i'll hit him again with with you shoot again okay do you have more


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:33]** Yeah, I can hit him with just a regular... A little helper?

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:44]** The weapon itself, without any biohacks, is just 1d4 plus 2 acid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** Okay.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** So what does that look like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:55]** It has its magazine of... Right, but do you kind of go through and you're like, ah, shoot!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** Oh, shoot.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** I don't have any more things.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:02]** Well, I do, but I'm thinking I might save it.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:03]** Okay.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** You're going to savor it?

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:05]** Okay.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:09]** So you shoot with just a blank one that deals acid damage.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Yeah.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:10]** Cool.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:11]** Give me that shot.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** Let me know what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:16]** That is 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** That is a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** All righty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** Remember that.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** All righty.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** You want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:33]** It's a miss as this injector sticks into the crate next to Trostenec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** I'm not going to do anything right now.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:37]** I think I'm in a good spot.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:38]** You're just cruising.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** Yeah, he can't get around this crate, can he?

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:45]** He could probably... You have cover if he wants to shoot at you.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:49]** Okay, so can I, like, just want to, like... You want to move?

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:50]** Not really.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** I just want to fortify my position.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:57]** You could do a defensive attack, but you already attacked.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** So, I don't know.

**[00:40:59 - 00:40:59]** Okay.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** All right.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:01]** You're good?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:05]** Yeah, I'm not going to use my move action, I don't think.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:05]** Probably.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:10]** Somebody tell me how I suck at Starfinder combat.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:11]** Write me.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:14]** Because you're not doing yourself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** Because I don't know what to do.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** I like my position.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** You should do your defense.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:23]** You could have done a defensive attack where you get a minus four to your attack, but you get a plus to your AC.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:27]** So I would imagine that you like trying to crouch down, you lean over, shoot, and come back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:29]** Yeah, I mean...

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:31]** I suppose it would have.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:33]** That's fine.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:34]** You suppose?

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:35]** Yeah.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** I wanted to hit him.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** Yeah, I get that.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** I understand.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:43]** It is the end of Dr.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** O.K.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** 's turn.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** And it is.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Trostnick's turn.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** What is Trostnick going to do?

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:53]** Does he fire at the person who electrocuted themselves or the slug?

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** Going to do one to three slug.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** Four to six.

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** Rick.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:00]** That's a five.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** So...

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:06]** I do have partial cover, correct?

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:11]** I would say that you have partial cover because you are behind a large crate.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:16]** So, Trostenec aims this pistol at you.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:21]** Just looks right down the sight.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:24]** That is a 20 to hit.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:25]** What?

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Are you kidding me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** Obviously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** He aims down the sight.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** Is it KAC?

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** Uh, yeah, that would be against KSC.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** With the minus two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** It's an 18 with a minus two.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** Thank you for that reminder.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** Does that still hit?

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** Oh, that's five points of damage.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:43]** Wait a second.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:49]** As maybe you just weren't paying attention and you were looking down at your arm and staying in just the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:55]** So I don't get anything with the partial cover, too, and also... You already have partial covers if you get shot at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:58]** Yeah, so you already have... Here's the thing.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** Partial cover would give a plus two to AC.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** If...

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** Both of you have partial cover right now.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:12]** If you were to try and squeeze or move closer behind that box, I think if Rick ducked behind the box, Rick would pretty much have total cover.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** There's no way that you would be able to see.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:24]** And I would say that Dark Hero K, you would probably have cover or possibly improved cover depending on how you went behind the box.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** But right now, you have partial cover.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** But he didn't fire at you.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** So...

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:43]** Trostenek fires at Rick and then just takes the pistol, looks at it, snarls, and then throws the pistol on the ground and looks over at Hears.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:46]** What will happen next round?

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** Hears, it's your turn.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** Wait, so he only had one shot?

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** Is that what happened?

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** Like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Yeah, he shot.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:56]** And then, yeah, he probably should have done a double attack.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:56]** That's okay.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** But then he would have had a minus four.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** So he shot.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** And then, oh, but you know what?

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** He did drop it.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:05]** So what he's going to do is, I don't know why I didn't even think about this.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** He is going to, huh?

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** Yeah.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** Why did you remind me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** No, I'm just confused.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** Like he shot once.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** He shot once and then dropped his gun.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:12]** Like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:22]** Yeah, because I was really focused on trying to make that happen, because he really, what he really wants to do, and this is exactly what happens, he turns to look at here's, and then he takes two steps forward.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** God dang it.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:26]** Oh, that's 15 feet, which is fine.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** It's within his encumbered movement.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:40]** Kind of slowly starts to move his way over, and then just takes his hand to his side, and Rick, you see, as he brings his hand around, you hear like...

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:49]** And this war hammer just starts to light up and electricity starts to like course around his hand as he moves towards here to swing.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** Here's what he's doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** So I can defend myself.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** Oh, yeah, this is my turn.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** So he is not attacking on this turn?

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:57]** He can't.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** No, he can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:00]** You are in a threatened square, though.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:00]** So be careful.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:04]** If you were to leave that square, you will get an attack of energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** But you can do a guarded step.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** You can do a guarded step.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:11]** Also, if you shoot within melee range, you will incur attack of opportunity or cast a spell.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** Could someone explain to me the guarded step again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:14]** Yeah.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:17]** It's a five-foot step, but that takes your entire move.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:17]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Yep.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:22]** So that's your move action is to move five feet out of the way without incurring attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** But you get to do so without incurring the attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:27]** Or you could just incur it and take the chance.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** Or shoot a spell.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:34]** I'm pretty much just riding on Rick's high right now because Rick's just feeding me things to do.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** So it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:41]** Yeah, but presumably he can just move and attack me again if I take a guarded step.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** So, I mean, that's true.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** Go ahead, Kevin.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:51]** If you don't move and you use a ranged weapon, does magic also incur attack spells?

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:52]** Yes.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:57]** So if you do a spell or use a ranged weapon right now, he gets an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:57]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:00]** So then he can still attack you the next turn.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:02]** So that would be two attacks instead of one.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:12]** But if you do the guarded step back, then you can get out of his attack and do an attack of your own, or you can do a guarded step back and then run for it.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:15]** What do you want to do?

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** Your full turn would be moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:36]** but you'll be out of his range at least yeah uh here's is gonna take a guarded step back okay and going to onto the body of the captain to the head of captain oh god okay and going to shoot a magic missile okay yeah nice yeah

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:43]** And so that is used to the die being.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:43]** Okay.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** Got it.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** I'm going to roll right now.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:45]** 1D4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** You only get two magic missiles though, right?

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:47]** Sorry?

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:50]** You only get two shots of magic missile because it's not a full turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** Because I can't take a full action because I took a guard step.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:53]** Yeah.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** Oh, good God.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** It's just four.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:57]** Four?

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** You only rolled one.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:00]** I rolled two.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:03]** Oh.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:03]** Oh, okay.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** So it's not four points of damage?

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:07]** I'm just going to do, like, 1d4 plus zero then to round it.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:09]** Okay, so it's actually seven points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:09]** Wow.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** Okay, not bad.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:10]** Nice.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:11]** That's good.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Good job here.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:16]** You see Trostenek get hit by...

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:21]** kind of shake their eyes off and then look back at you even fiercer.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:22]** Oh, God.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:26]** Nico, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:32]** So can I pop around the corner and shoot Trostenec and then get back behind cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** Yeah, I don't see why not.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:38]** I will say that you're already behind cover now, so he probably wouldn't shoot you.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:42]** Don't forget that you can do the defensive attack as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:45]** You can't move, shoot, and move unless you have that feat, right?


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** Really?

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** I feel like we did that last combat.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** Are we correcting ourselves now?

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:51]** I want to be right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:55]** Bruce Lawyer is now in session.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** All righty.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** Let's see.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** I don't even know where that would fall under.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** That's under... Yeah, you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** You need a shot on the run.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** That's as a full action.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:07]** You can move up to your speed, make a single ranged attack at any point.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** That's different.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** That's normal.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:16]** You can move only before or after an attack with a ranged weapon, not both.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:20]** So if we made that mistake last time, thanks for noticing, Kev.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:20]** For who?

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:20]** Who did that?

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:21]** I don't know.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** I feel like I did.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** Maybe someone else did.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** I think you did.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:24]** You did.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:24]** You cheated.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:25]** You owe us.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** Whoa.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:26]** Wow.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:26]** Okay.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Wow.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Harsh.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:28]** Okay, cool.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:36]** Now that we're all looking down at our rule books, Nico, no, you cannot go, shoot, and then come back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:41]** You could right now, though, shoot from behind cover, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:43]** Yes, you could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:46]** It's not the same as moving out, shooting and moving back in.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:51]** You're just leaning around the corner to shoot through cover or with cover.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:56]** And the way they discuss cover in the book is you draw a line from one of your corners.

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:01]** So your corner would be the corner sharing that wall through or to the character.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:04]** So you technically could see this guy from standing behind cover.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** Right, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** I think so.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:11]** I don't think that they would get cover because you're kind of leaning around.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:19]** But again, you can do a fight defensively and you will get a plus two bonus AC in case they attack you next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** John's really trying to sell that.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** But a minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:32]** I'm trying to get you guys to do more things because I myself am not always good at thinking of more things because I'm mostly just thinking about a million other things and we're doing all those calculations wrong.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:35]** So what do you want to do, Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:50]** Nico hearing the electro charge of the hammer does it cinematically for flavor peeks around the corner for a second, sees Trostenec with the hammer and he's just going to pop out real quick and take a shot at Trostenec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:51]** with this pistol.

**[00:49:52 - 00:50:04]** I am going to say that Trostanek's probably going to get partial cover just because of where, like, in the same way that you get partial cover because a line goes from his square to yours through the wall, it's the same backwards.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:05]** Actually, hold on.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** So he'll probably get partial cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:11]** Nico, actually, instead of doing that, Nico's going to go to here, which is just behind this little trash can.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** Okay.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:18]** And he's going to take a shot at Trostanek with cover, but Trostanek doesn't have any.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:20]** I'll say that you have partial cover there.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:24]** So cover only gives you AC when you are being attacked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:25]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:30]** So right now you're standing behind, we'll say it's a low object.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** So that would only give you partial cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:36]** Gives you partial cover, but you have to be within six squares in order for it to be effective as low cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:41]** Yeah, and he is one, two, three, within six squares, so it's fine.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:41]** Okay.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** I'm just saying.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** No, no, no.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** It's all good.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** You are the rules lawyer.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:47]** We have designated you as so.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:50]** Your salary and contract reflects that.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Is that true?

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:52]** What?

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:54]** You guys are getting paid for this?

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:54]** Yeah.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** You guys are getting paid for this?

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** What?

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** Nico, roll.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** What's your roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:03]** I got an 18, natural 18 on the die, plus 3.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** Plus 3?

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** Plus 6, 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Yeah, that hits.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Against EAC or KAC?

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** It's going to be EAC.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Okay, yeah, that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:13]** Here we go.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** Sorry, it was kind of in my hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** Three.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** Three points of damage.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:20]** All right.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** You shoot.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:27]** Probably hits his leg or hits his side.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:28]** And he keeps going.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:31]** And he's just going to kind of yell out.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** Yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:36]** As he takes a shot, he's going to yell out, hey, ugly, over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** And shoots.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:40]** Okay.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** I like it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** It's the top of round two.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** Rick, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:44]** Yes!

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:49]** Before Rick shoots again, he's going to tell Trostendak.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:56]** He's like, so, can you inform me, are you hunting Algiana or looking for her to help you with your plans?

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** And then he's going to pull the trigger.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:02]** Wow.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** How does punishment work?

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:08]** I add my one point to the roll or the attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** I think whichever one you want to decide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** Well, then can I add it to damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** Yeah.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** All right.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:20]** Then I've got a 13 plus 7 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:22]** Wait, actually, let me go back.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** I feel like it's a D20 roll.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** It's anything that you're rolling with a d20.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** My damage is a d20, so I can add it.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** That's false.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** Oh, man.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** Did we all agree on a d20?

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** I felt like that was the intention.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** Is it like a skill check?

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:37]** Yeah, like it could be a skill, could be an attack roll.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:38]** So let's do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:39]** Okay.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** I won't use it this time anyways.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:42]** Okay.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Because I already rolled.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** But now I know.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:44]** Okay.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:48]** So I will... Shoot.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** Yeah, I already shot.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** It's a 13 plus 7 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:51]** Okay.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** Yeah, that hits.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:55]** Against KSE, that hits.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:55]** Yes.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:56]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** So that's a 10.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** That's only three points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:11]** Three points of damage as Trostanek gets hit in the back.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:14]** And you see his muscles spasm under the armor.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** Well done.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** You shouted at him, asking him, goading him.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Here's what are you doing?

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:23]** You're standing right above the captain.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Not that I... Wait, sorry.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** Isn't it Trostnick's turn?

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** Not that I... No, it's Dr.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:28]** O.K.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:28]** 's turn.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** I got that mixed up.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:29]** It's Dr.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** 's turn.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:31]** Yeah.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** is going to...

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:41]** Can I occupy this square in front, like where I was hiding behind cover?

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:44]** Like can I achieve cover here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:47]** It's a little tenuous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:53]** You would have the same cover as Nico did with the wall if you were standing here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:57]** Well, actually, that's what I'm going to say.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:00]** Yeah, you would have cover if you were standing.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:05]** So we're talking about between the back wall of this cargo bay and the crates in front.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:09]** If you were standing here, you would definitely have cover, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** This is inside the room?

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** Or is this the wall?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:13]** Yeah.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:17]** This is the your your back is up against the wall right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** Okay, great.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:30]** Yeah Because I don't think you can occupy the same square as the as those crates are and it's just a little too small Yeah, so I have my weapon out One more round With the cost of jet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:34]** Yeah Okay, give me that sweet sweet roll

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** What's it gonna be?

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:39]** What's it gonna be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** 19 on the die plus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** Wow, y'all are rolling rocks today.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:45]** 22!

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** That's a crazy hit.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** Nice.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:52]** And this is just another blank one, not a rice pudding?

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** Yeah.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** Okay.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:55]** How much damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:55 - 00:55:00]** What's the rule with weapons that have critical between 19 and 20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** Hold on one sec.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** It's just a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:04]** Is that a weapon-specific thing?

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:06]** Five points of acid damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:08]** Five points of acid damage.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:18]** Wow, you see that acid start to burn through some of the armor, and you can tell as he kind of shakes off some of the damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** What a beast.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** Some of the damage.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** He shakes off some of the damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:26]** Yeah, if I shake off, I mean he shakes.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:32]** He tries to get the acid off as you've hit it onto his Vesk skin.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:33]** You were asking about 19 to 20.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:36]** I think that's just a weapons special property.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** Okay, cool.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:42]** I'm going to move.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:45]** You already moved.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** You already moved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** Yeah, you can't move and then after.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:52]** As we have established on episode 20.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:52]** Not before.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** That was our fault.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:54]** Cool.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:55]** We have fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** I'm sure I brought that up before.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** Just nobody ever listens to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:59]** That's super not true.

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** We always do.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:04]** Oh, woe is the rules lawyer.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:05]** Woe is my life.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:07]** Everyone hates the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** Rules for pretend time.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** No one listens to him.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:15]** He makes his rules and he doesn't do shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:17]** Point of pretend time procedure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:23]** Trostenek points his hammer at Rick and says, you're next.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:27]** And then walks over to Hears to attack.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:30]** Still going to take on Hears after getting hit once.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:39]** With the magic missile swings this war hammer at you, and that is a 21 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:42]** Well, that does hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:44]** I thought so.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** That's K, so you're right.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** That is going to be against...

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:52]** I guess it's probably going to be against EAC.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:53]** Oh.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Based on what it is.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** Okay.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** Ow.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:57]** Yeah.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:58]** Ow.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** Indeed.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** Oh, is that what I think it is?

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** Oh, yeah, it is.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:08]** That's 15 points of damage as this electric hammer bludgeoned into you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** That sounded so gross, John.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** Is that what I think it is?

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** Oh, yeah, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:14]** Nick, you're the only person who says that.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** It's all right, Nick.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:18]** It's a rare honor that you hold that mantle.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:22]** So Trostanek hits you with 15 points of damage.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:24]** Here's, I don't know what you're at, but that was intense.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:29]** This is going to be a rough fight.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:31]** Ow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** That's all he says.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** Ow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** Here's, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:36]** What do you want to do?

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** Good God.

**[00:57:40 - 00:58:04]** i don't think here's can like all right i can now move without invoking an attack of opportunity at this point no because you're you're back in a threatened square because you move forward so you but like i said you could do a guarded step and then run away for it and you could i think here's is going to have to do that because this is insane so here's is going to take a guarded step and he's going to run behind rick

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:04]** Okay.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** Just lead it right to Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** Behind Rick.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** Yeah.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:10]** So if you're going to pass through.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** You're leaving that threatened square.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** You're going to make.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:15]** He's going to get an attack for opportunity against you.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** I have to like run away.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** I can't run past Trost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:21]** So his threatened squares are the nine squares around him.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:21]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:26]** And the thing is that if you make a guarded step into any one of those others, then that was your move action.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:31]** You can't like you moved without incurring an attack for opportunity, but you're still within his range.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:34]** So if you want to go past him, yeah, but that is your move.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:36]** So you step back.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:38]** You two are in the middle of the room.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** Yeah.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:39]** Okay.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** Well, you can't run now.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** Well, I thought I could.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:45]** The guarded step is your move action.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:48]** I thought a guarded step, then I could do either action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:50]** The next round, he can run.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:50]** That's true.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:55]** You could not shoot or attack at all, and you could make a move action right now to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:55]** That's what I meant.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:58]** Yeah, you can guard a step and then move.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** Cool is getting the hell out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** Okay.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:02]** Cool.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:05]** Get to cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** Cool lawyer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:13]** So each diagonal is five.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:15]** When you make two diagonals, it's 15.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:17]** So I feel like you were standing right in front.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** You took a step back.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:18]** That's fine.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** You move one diagonal up.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** That's five, 10, 15.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:30]** And then if you move to here, that's 30 feet of movement right behind this crate.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:31]** Perfect.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Okay.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** So you run all the way back.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** So right now, Trost and X in the open.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:39]** is behind cover, behind the secure access.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:42]** Rick is kind of behind cover, not really.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:45]** And Hears and Nico are on the other side of the room.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:47]** So you definitely are all around him.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:50]** This is tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** What is he going to do?

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:52]** Was that your turn, Hears?

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** That was Hears' turn.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:56]** I can't do anything else, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:56]** Correct.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:59]** Maybe he wanted to get to the center, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** Maybe he's a secret solarian.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** He's just going to explode.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** Nico, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:12]** Nico is going to take another shot, and as he says it, he's going to... I think I have something for this, don't I?

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** I think I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** What do you have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Oh, I know what I'm doing.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:20]** I'm going to be doing a trick attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:25]** All right, tricky, tricky, tricky.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** What are you doing?

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** Attack!

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:29]** So I need to do what, a blue check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** It's tricky to rock and roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:31 - 01:01:00]** attempt a bluff I'm doing a bluff check on you okay and then the DC is I think it's 20 plus the creature CR correct Amundos it's 20 plus target CR yep yeah so give me your roll and what do you say with your bluff or what do you do what's your it's your bluff action so Nico's gonna say over here and then he'll he's gonna try to duck over he's gonna duck over the other side of the cover and shoot from there

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:08]** So he's going to be popping out of the shot slot out of the 90-degree spot.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:10]** 90 degrees from the top.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:10]** Okay.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** Okay.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:12]** If that makes sense.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:14]** 98 degrees from the top?

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:14]** Yep.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** Yeah, 90 degrees.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** Okay.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** Oh, my.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:22]** That's a natty 18.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** What's your bluff check?

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:24]** Plus 8 is 26.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:25]** 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:27]** That's the bluff check.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** You meet it.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:29]** You meet it.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:36]** You can tell that he successfully is looking over, and then you duck down to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** All right, here we go.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:39]** Here's the shot.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:40]** Does it hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** Here's the shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:45]** 17 plus 3 is a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** Yeah.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** Wow.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** That is a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** Desperately trying to hit this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:53]** You are really.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:54]** I mean, you guys are rolling pretty well.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:57]** I'm going to say you're pretty consecutively like getting pretty hit.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** All right.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** That's three points of damage.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:01]** Three points of damage.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:02]** Talk a big talk.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** Carry a little stick.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:06]** Three points of damage.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** I don't appreciate that, John.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:11]** I'm just saying, you're chipping away, chipping away.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:13]** Death by a thousand cuts.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:15]** Death by a thousand cuts.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:19]** But he is currently now flat-footed, so he will get a minus two to his AC.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:23]** Is it for the next round, or is it for the next person who attacks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:29]** He's flat-footed through his next turn.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:31]** Okay, next turn.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]** Got it.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:33]** Cool.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:33]** Done.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:40]** So, Nico is going to look over at Hears just after he pops back inside of cover.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:46]** And he's going to say to Hears, I saw this one on a pre-gap show.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:50]** And he says behind cover, he's like, I fart in your general direction.


## Speaker_0

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:58]** Here's just laughs nervously because he has no idea what he's talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:02]** Yeah, and Nico's like a strange connoisseur of a lot of things pre-gap.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** Really, really weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:07]** Could I do a knowledge check to see what I would know of that reference?

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:08]** On your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:12]** You could, but it's the top of round three right now, and it's Rick's turn.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:13]** What are you doing, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:19]** I'm not trying to be a rules lawyer all the time, but technically using a skill is an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:20]** Technically using what?

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:23]** Doing a skills check is an action.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** Not all of them, but some of them, yes.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:26]** I've got a thing for it.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:26]** Cool.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:28]** What are you doing on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:30]** Also, I'm looking up the move, the double move thing.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:34]** I'm not sure if technically you can do a guard a step and then a move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:36]** You can substitute a standard action for a move action.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** Where does it say that?

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:42]** It says at the top of the chapter on attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:47]** I mean, sorry, as the rules lawyer, I spend most of my game with my nose in this book.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** Yeah, you should have known.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:50]** But what do you want to do on your turn?

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** On my turn, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** Yeah.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:57]** So Rick is going to jump.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:57]** I'm trying to decide.

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:59]** Is he going to slide backwards?

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:01]** He's going to sashay.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:02]** Slide to the left.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:05]** He's going to move back behind this box here.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:06]** Okay.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** As slickly as possible.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:09]** So that's 5, 10, 15.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:09]** Okay, cool.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** Nice.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:13]** So, yeah, I think he's just going to shimmy back there.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:14]** Okay.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** Stepping aside.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:16]** Nothing too fancy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** A little shimmy, shimmy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** A little shims.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:23]** And then he's going to say to Tresnick, like, you never answered me.

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:25]** Are you hunting down Algiana?

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:28]** And then he's going to open fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** Give me that shot.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:35]** I got 17 to hit.

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:38]** 17 to hit against KAC, correct?


## Speaker_0

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:38]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:42]** Hey, it's kinetic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:44]** Oh, it's a laser pistol, so it's EAC.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** It's laser.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:46]** Yeah, that's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:47]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:47]** That's a hit.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:53]** Four points of damage.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:55]** Four points of damage.

**[01:04:57 - 01:05:05]** Trostenec looks like he is starting to grow weary and he's pretty bloodied.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** What else do you want to do on your turn?

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:10]** You moved, you shot, you incited him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:13]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:14]** Yeah, that's it.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:16]** Dr. Okay, it's your turn.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:19]** You wanted to do a, I believe it was a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:21]** No, I was making a joke.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:23]** There was no action required if you wanted to do that.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:26]** Nick's Monty Python reference.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:29]** Oh, so you succeeded at your check.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:38]** Dr. Okay wonders if his father smells of elder bellers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:42]** IRL Kelly did get that reference.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:44]** Just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:45]** There we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:49]** This is a Monty Python heavy episode for those Monty Python fans.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:51]** That's true.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:53]** Dr. OK, what are you doing on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:56]** Dr. OK is going to lay it on me.

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:57]** Check the door.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:04]** I trust Nick makes sure that he's not being followed by anyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:06]** The door is open.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:12]** But if you look around, you don't see anybody else in the server farm behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:15]** All right.

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:19]** Can I roll perception to see if I can, like, operate the door from inside, like, close?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:22]** Yeah.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:26]** I'll just say that if you want to try and operate it, you can operate it.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:27]** That's not a problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:27]** Okay.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:28]** So I'm going to close the door.

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:29]** Okay.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:31]** So he can't escape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:37]** Okay, give me a computers check.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** Are you trying to lock it or just close it?

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:41]** I could lock it.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:44]** Okay, then give me a computers check.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:46]** Or an engineer check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:53]** That is 13 on the die plus 9 for computers.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** Yeah, that's a good enough.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:58]** You are able to... And it's locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:58 - 01:06:59]** Shut and locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:01]** Is that kind of my full round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:04]** I would say that interacting with an object is your standard action.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:07]** And you moved over, so that's probably your round.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:09]** Yeah, I'm good.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:10]** Okay.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:11]** It is Trostenec's turn.

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:19]** Trostenec is going to turn around after hearing Rick's insightful comment and says, you're next.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:27]** And then takes these big lumbering steps over to right in front of you and is going to swing at you.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:29]** Rick.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:32]** No joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:40]** That's game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:40]** What?

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:41]** You're cheating us on that one.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:47]** John, I would like to lodge a formal protest about you ending games on dice rolls.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:48]** Objection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:54]** I second that objection, Kev.

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:58]** And I think that elderberry smell is you, John.

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:01]** Because you know what really grinds my gears?

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:06]** It's not fumbling a roll or running out of pizza or beer while at the table.

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:08]** No, what grinds my gears is ending the game.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:11]** Or more to the point, not playing tabletop RPGs.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:13]** Are you like us?

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:17]** Are you plotting to launch a formal protest against your GM?

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:23]** Or is John just milking the podcast medium to create tension for the sake of performative art?

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:29]** Or, more likely, are we just a bunch of bickering PCs who are always running long?

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:37]** Let us know on our Twitter at we'll save podcasts where Kevin John will definitely have some well-reasoned arguments about how they're right.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:51]** Kelly and I will be sure to post some gifts for the lulz and Ninja, our unofficial podcast that secretly whispers to me in the night will take over my consciousness and surprise us all with his inflammatory remarks in all caps.

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:56]** See you next time where me and Nick break out pitchforks and storm John's house.

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:58]** Take care, everyone.

**[01:08:59 - 01:08:59]** Except you, John.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:01]** You take extra care.

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:03]** Until next time.
