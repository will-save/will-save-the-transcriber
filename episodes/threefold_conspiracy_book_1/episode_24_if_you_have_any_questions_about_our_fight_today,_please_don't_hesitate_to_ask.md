## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:05]** Last time on We'll Save... Pirate Ambush!

**[00:00:05 - 00:00:10]** The group is assailed by two starfishers while they are planning their next move.

**[00:00:11 - 00:00:19]** Startled by the attack, the well-disciplined group retreated behind cover before counterattacking the starfisher reinforcements.

**[00:00:20 - 00:00:26]** The tide of battle turns when HEARS supercharges RIK-19's artillery laser.

**[00:00:26 - 00:00:32]** Rick-19 takes aim and fires one decisive shot at the Vesk, killing it instantly.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:42]** However, the ship is still bugging wildly, there are more pirates aboard, and a potentially dangerous treasure is on the verge of falling into the wrong hands.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:45]** How will our courageous passengers respond?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:57]** When I was in, like, sixth grade, my teacher, my science teacher, who was really cool, Mr. Wieseke, was like, before school, you could come to his classroom, right?

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:00]** And hang out and, like, play Lero and do cool stuff.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:01]** And the guard would be like...

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:05]** I don't know if you're allowed to come in so early to school.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:08]** And then you show them the badge that Mr. Whiskey would make for you.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:11]** And he'd always write your name on it real quick.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:14]** And then be like, is allowed in and like big cap, like capital letters.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:19]** He tried to write Jonathan Swan on it and was like, this is too long.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:23]** And then he was like, John, John Swan, that's it.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** And then just wrote is allowed.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:30]** And I was like, my mind was blown because sixth grade me was like, you can shorten someone's name.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:52]** that's funny why what is she going and my identity changed forever and then that's when I realized that my name rhymes and I was like okay now I need to like live up to whoever and that's when you became a musician and that's and I sang it that's the day that's that's the first time notes erupted from me as if I were in a musical


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:52 - 00:03:15]** i have a friend uh carlos torres what's up buddy i hope you're listening uh we i've known him since i think it was like second grade technically um but we actually went like went to class together in third grade and we were out of the playground one time and he pulled me aside and he's like hey i just have to tell you something and i was like okay what and he's like my name in english is charles

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** That's so great.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:22]** And as like a third grader, I was like, what?

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:24]** What?

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:24]** Oh, my God.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:25]** Mind blown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** Yeah.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** Wow.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** Well.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:34]** Unless I do want to see if anybody else's players have nicknames.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:42]** But the reason that I brought this up was because I wanted to ask if your characters have nicknames.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** And if they did, how did they get them?

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** Who gave them to them?

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** Do they go by them?

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Do they tell anybody?

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:49]** I don't think it's come up yet, really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** Well, it certainly comes up for Dr. O.K.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** in the sense that Dr. O.K.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** is an abbreviation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:55]** That is true.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** He goes by Dr. O.K.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** What is his full name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:14]** Dr. Conto Casas but yeah it's a little backwards it's not a true nickname or a true abbreviation but yeah and it came up I suppose for Dr. O.K.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:28]** dealing with very fast minded people and a slow talker it's better for me to say Dr. O.K.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:34]** versus Dr. Contupetus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** You're like the sloth from Zootopia.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:41]** So everyone just like their eyes would glaze over when you say your whole name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:43]** Dr. Okay is much easier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:51]** But the best part is that it's other Osharus who... The question is, is that just a typical Osharu speaking cadence or pattern?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:56]** Or are there different ones?

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** I would say...

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:59]** No, it's not typical.

**[00:04:59 - 00:04:59]** Okay.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:05]** I mean, we're, you know, there are different Osharu's, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** That's true.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:09]** Just didn't know if that was like a cultural thing, maybe, but it's not.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** It's all right.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:10]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** Anybody else?

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:15]** Well, I guess I can go next.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:25]** So androids are fabricated humans, and a lot of times they don't take on a name.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:30]** But for Rick, his name is actually an acronym for his model number.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:35]** Um, so his model number is a ring works industry, calimetric kineticist.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:41]** Um, and that is shortened down to Rick and he's a Mark 19, which gives him the 19 number.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** So Rick 19.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** I had no idea.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** That's cool.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** Well, now you do.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** The more you know.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Yeah.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:54]** Yeah.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:57]** I would say... Oh, go ahead.

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:06]** I was just going to say, Hears does not have a nickname, but if anyone comes up with one, let me know, and I'll think about it as time goes on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:09]** Was your mom or dad never like, Hearsie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:36]** here's uh didn't really have too much of a relationship with his mom or dad from a pretty young age so yeah here's he that would be cute but unfortunately no and you guys come up with some suggestions i'll think about it maybe we can define like what here's his nickname is as time goes on based on his behavior and stuff yeah yeah or the listeners or here's is short for something what is it frankly i thought about calling you hearsay a bunch of times but oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** Punishment.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** You wasted a punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** It's good, though.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** It's good.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:48]** If you give a bad pun, the punishment's screwed for the rest of the episode.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** No one can get it.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** No one can use it, though.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:56]** Yeah, if the listeners come up with something, please do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** If y'all want to give me a punishment for that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** No, no.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** We're not going to give you a punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:03]** All right.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** Nico.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** Do it in role play.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** That's the rule.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** It's on the site.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:12]** It's on the site.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** It's official now.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:16]** It's literally in tiny text at the bottom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** Check out the website.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:21]** Make comments about our house rules.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:25]** It's one of those things where it's like, look in the left, and then you look in the left.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** Look in the right.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** Look beneath the triangle.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:32]** You have to do punishment in role play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:36]** I'm glad we don't have to bring the House of Commons into session here, but...

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:41]** Um, um, Nico, he doesn't have a nickname though.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:49]** He's always kind of internally sought the kind of moniker of, uh, of, uh, quick fire.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:50]** Nice.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:55]** Cause he's always, he's practiced with using tool pistols at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** So he's also experience.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** You can't make up your own nickname.

**[00:07:59 - 00:07:59]** It'll never work.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:03]** I just say, so nobody will ever call you quick fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:05]** It's just, Hey,

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** Hey, that's not true.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:11]** And we have cinematic examples of such.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:12]** All right.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:18]** Peter Quill wanted to be called Star-Lord for such a long time.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:29]** And at the end of his movie, where he cited Footloose as the greatest movie in the world, someone said, Star-Lord.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** And he said, finally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:31]** Finally.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:36]** I hope you have that great fortune.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:37]** Me too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:43]** It will only take a dance battle for the, uh, was it the Power Stone?

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:48]** Hey, look, I've talked about how this adventure path is highly unique.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** So maybe there's a dance battle in the future.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** Maybe there's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:57]** Entirely unique, but maybe it will follow the exact outline of Guardians of the Galaxy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:03]** Yeah, it might or might not be just a shot-for-shot remake of Guardians of the Galaxy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:06]** If you like pina coladas.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:09]** And then we'll just play 70s and 80s music the whole time.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** Roll an athletics check.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:12]** And a persuasion check at the same time.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** Wait, why an athletics check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:18]** Yeah, dancing falls under survival.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** What are you dancing for?

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:21]** Dex?

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** Yeah, so it's athletics.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:26]** I would think it's an acrobatics trick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:28]** Well, it depends on the type of dance you're doing.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:28]** Breakdancing.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:31]** Yeah, if you're breakdancing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:34]** You didn't specify what type of dancing we were doing.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:37]** For all you knew, I could have just been doing the coffee grinder.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:39]** You are correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** True that.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** Wait, I'm curious.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:46]** Kevin, you said that when you try to give a nickname to yourself, it doesn't stick ever.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** Have you attempted this?

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** No, I was just joking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** I have had nicknames in real life, though.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** All through high school, I was called Milky.

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:22]** milky yep uh and everybody thinks it's because i i was actually like um one of the few white kids at my school my school was four percent white um and i was a part of a fraternity where i was only one of a handful of you know white skinned people um and so everybody has everybody assumes uh it was actually it that's a long story we'll get into it another time five beta sigmas uh high school version sigma beta uh

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** I'm not ashamed of it.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** I can gladly go into it.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** It's just like a long conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:29]** We only have an hour, Kif.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** I know, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:31]** Of these blessings, precious time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:37]** But everybody would call me Milky, and everybody assumed that I was called Milky because I was the white kid in the group.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:49]** But really, it's because I bought Milky Way bars from my teacher slash fraternal advisor every day for the entire time I was in school.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:51]** Your teacher sold you candy?


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:56]** And the funds went to the fraternity.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:59]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:02]** Just marking them up at insane prices.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:02]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** Rialto?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** Rialto, California?

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** San Bernardino?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** Okay, okay.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** Got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:11]** Far East LA?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** I see.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:19]** Actually, what I was going to say is really boring, so I'm not going to say it anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:26]** What I was going to say was that, real quick, and then we can start playing, because I've been waiting all week to play.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:29]** You were talking about how you bought Milky Way bars all the time.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:34]** And that sounds just like me as a little kid, because I used to eat those Nutter Butter bars.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:34]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:37]** You know, like the ones that were like the wafers with the peanut butter and the chocolate around?

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Yeah, Nutter Butters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:40]** And I would eat it every day at lunch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** Until somebody stole it.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** And then one day...

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** What?

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:45]** No, go ahead.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:50]** So one day at lunch, I just couldn't open it.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:52]** And I was just like a chubby kid.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:55]** I would like just have been my whole life.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** And I was like eating.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:59]** And then I was like, excuse me, can you please open this?

**[00:11:59 - 00:11:59]** Because I couldn't open it.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:03]** And then literally the lunch attendant came over and said...

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:05]** You know, if you keep eating these, you're going to turn into one.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:08]** And then I started to cry.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:13]** I couldn't handle it.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** That is really sad.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** I know, and I called my mom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:19]** It was shaped like a peanut, so you'd end up being shaped like a peanut, which would be interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:23]** I have one cafeteria story, and it's really lame.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** I want to hear it.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:33]** In my elementary school in Fairfax, I tried to lead a boycott against the cafeteria school food.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** What?

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** Because it was terrible.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** That's so funny.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:40]** I got in a whole lot of trouble that I had to change schools.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** Are you serious?

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** That's really funny.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** I accidentally changed schools.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:49]** Wait, did you also try to create an insurrection at your school?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:52 - 00:13:19]** waving a flag people got really upset because I was like I am William Garrett they may take our food they may take our flavor but they will never take our freedom fairly accurate yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** I see.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** Damn.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** That's actually kind of awesome.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** Not a flunk scale at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** That's pretty great.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** Respect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:36]** In sixth grade, I would actually... It was, I think, $2 for the full meal, but it was 50 cents for chocolate milk and 50 cents for a cookie.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** So every day for lunch, I'd have two chocolate milks and two cookies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Nice.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:43]** Smart, man.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:45]** Quick maps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:48]** Good wholesome food right there.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:52]** That's like at USC in college each day.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** That's just what you ate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:55]** Not second grade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** Not second grade.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:58]** In college.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:10]** Well, speaking of eating chocolate milk, drinking chocolate milk, and poor segues...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:23]** Leading insurrections against the tyrannical cafeteria school district food caterer program.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Oh my gosh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:27]** That is but a microcosm of this adventure.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:31]** A small snippet of what could be on the Chimera.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:33]** That might have been the coolest story I think I've ever heard.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:36]** That was awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:40]** did storm into the kitchen on the Chimera.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:40]** It's true.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** On an alternative kind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** Episode two or three.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** On an alternative kind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** It all makes sense now.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** The threats are coming in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:52]** This adventure path has been building your whole life.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:57]** I've reached out to people in your past in order to make the real life connections to your character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:01]** We'll send a request in to Adam Sandler to write Sloppy Joe.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:07]** And lunch lady land.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:11]** That was a very popular song at the time.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Not to date myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** It's okay.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:20]** So, let's jump in.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:25]** I've been waiting for this hour all week.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:34]** And I'm stoked to talk about how you all have, you know, gone through.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:39]** You went up this hatch that was a secret hatch in a secret compartment.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:45]** You exit through a door that leads to the starboard cargo area.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:46]** You come in.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** Starboard?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:47]** Starboard.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** Starboard.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:49]** Starboard.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:50]** Starlord.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:51]** Starbird.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** Starbirds.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:56]** And... Quickfire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:58]** You see before you... I mean, you can say starboard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** Starboard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:59 - 00:15:59]** Starboard.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:06]** You see before you Song, who is collapsed on the ground.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:10]** And come to find out, they are lifeless.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** They are dead.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:16]** You take out the threats of three space pirates.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:24]** You kill one, knock one unconscious, and then are currently talking to the third.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:32]** And I just want to ask you guys, as we jump back in, what are your thoughts on what you're going to say to this pirate?

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:42]** Because I think last time we talked about how some of you wanted to just, you know, imprison her, perhaps in a crate.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:45]** Some of you wanted to use her to try and convince her to help out.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:47]** So...

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:52]** I want to give you guys the space just for a minute to talk about that.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** You can do it in character, but I don't know.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** It might be nice outside of character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:56 - 00:17:13]** Out of character, and I believe hearsay, we'll believe in this, we'll agree with this, is I think Nico is definitely going to try to get her to turncoat and actually fight against the people she was hired to serve along with to get Plunder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:16]** Kevin thinks that's a terrible idea.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:23]** I don't know how you expect to trust a space pirate to fall along with you and not shoot you in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:27]** Oh, I fully intend for her to lead the way.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** She's going to be on point.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:35]** Like, I do not trust her, but I do recognize she can be a value and can be used to our own ends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** I don't know about that, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:49]** Dr. Okay thinks that if we're going to be dealing with pirates, it's best to have as much collateral as well as leverage as possible.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:52]** As a... For keeping her alive, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** Oh, in order to have her help us?

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** Like leverage over her?

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** Yes.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** I don't know what leverage we have over her.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:58]** That's the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:04]** Well, we could always trade her for, you know, some of the crew with the pirates or whatever, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:07]** Yeah, I see where you're going with that.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:12]** Well, I don't think pirates are going to trade one life for a hostage.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:16]** So they're not willing to trade... They don't believe in hostages?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:22]** Yeah, they're not going to trade their hostages for another crewmate, but you expect their crewmates to turn on them.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** I'm so confused on the hierarchy of pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** There's not much of a hierarchy.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:32]** As a character who's a pirate, I can say that they will stick up for each other.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:35]** It's not like... They do form friendships and bonds and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** So you wouldn't trust one to turn on their crew either, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** Right.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** Yeah, that could happen, but...

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** I mean, yeah.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** You've got to vet your pirates, all right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:45 - 00:19:06]** I know one thing that's on Rick's mind is he still wants to know, like, there's so much going on in the ship right now, and we know now that Algiata and Trustneck are the astrozoans that were related to, or not related, associated with these starfishers, but the starfishers don't recognize the astrozoans as a part of their crew.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** So there's that mix.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:11]** But then there's also the hobgoblin and the goblins,

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:17]** Which seemed to be at least doing whatever the starfishers intended to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** Maybe all of these people are here for the same thing.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** It's like a situation.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** For different reasons, though?

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** Yeah, I could see that.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** Like smoking aces.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Terrible movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** I'll also give a little reminder.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** And maybe this is our...

**[00:19:33 - 00:20:01]** slightly more well positioned segue into playing which is that right as we ended you heard this thud against the south wall of the cargo bay and there was a communique coming in on the communicator of like help Jim please help and then the sounds of struggle and then a wait sorry on whose communique did we hear that

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:04]** It was on one of the pirates communicating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:06]** Oh, I thought it was coming over the ship's audio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** Yeah, same.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** No, it was on the pirates communicating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:12]** I changed my position then.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** I think we should keep her alive and use her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** Yep, for sure.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:22]** So with that said, I'm going to pull you guys over to the mapizzle.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** Mapizzle.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:27]** It's a technical Starfinder term for map.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** Mapizzle.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:34]** The thud hits the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:39]** You do know what's happening, she says to all of you.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:42]** I think we ended where you all were discussing what to do with her.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:46]** You do know what's happening, right?

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:50]** I told you that you should be careful.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** We are not to be messed with.

**[00:20:56 - 00:21:01]** That thud that you heard is just the beginning of our takeover.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:15]** You may have one in this little cargo bay of your little ship, but that does not mean that the war is lost and that we will take it all for ourselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:25]** Niko's going to roll diplomacy roll here, and Niko's going to say, exactly, and you are going to help us thwart your friends here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:27]** Here's is going to do sense motive.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** That could have very well just been her ally, so...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:37]** That's 17 plus 8, I believe, is my diplomacy check here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:38]** That's a two.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** Hears understands nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:40]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:42]** 17 plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** I'll do a sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** I got a 25 on my diplomacy.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** 25 on diplomacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:56]** Two from hears on trying to gauge the motive of her.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** And Dr.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:59]** O.K., what did you get on your sense motive?

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** 24.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:01]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** 24.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:16]** Your sense motive tells you that she is very confident in the abilities of her crew, and however, she is unsure

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:24]** that there's no way for her to know that that pound on the wall is winning or not.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:29]** She's clearly trying to intimidate, for lack of a better word.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:40]** Nico, as soon as you say that, she falters briefly and says, I have told you as much as I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:44]** I'm not asking you to tell us anything more about what you know.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:54]** I'm asking you to participate physically and most likely violently in the overthrow of your takeover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** If you want to live.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:59]** I have one more question to ask, if I may.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:02]** What do you know of the hobgoblins on board?

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** I'm sorry, who?

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:09]** What do you know of the goblins and the hobgoblin that were on board?

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:12]** I know nothing about them.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** So you know nothing of the situation that's happening on the ship.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** And he turns and walks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** Okay, so Rick walks away.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:22]** She is standing there still with her hands behind her back.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:24]** Can I roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** An intimidation on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:28]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** 15 plus 3 is 18.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:34]** She looks down at her feet.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:37]** Seems a little lost in thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:42]** What did my diplomacy check do on that, John?

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:44]** I was asking her to anticipate on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:45]** I'm getting to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** What is in it for me?

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** How about your life?

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:59]** You're at our mercy at the moment, and we'll decide whether or not you go free from here or are sucked out into space.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:09]** Because at this point, the way I see it, we're on a ship that's being overtaken by pirates, you being one of them.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:14]** And you're either with us or against us.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:20]** I don't have time to keep an eye on you, and I don't have time to lock you up in a crate and just hope you survive.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:31]** So you'll either participate in doing the right thing and getting the people on this passenger ship safely to Absalom, or...

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:40]** You can get an up close view of space and the stars without a vac suit.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** Your call.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:45]** Do you really trust me with a weapon?

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** I'm not going to trust you.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:52]** I'm not going to trust you, but you're on point and you're going to be in front of everybody else.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** Your call and your life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** I don't know if I like this plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:03]** You know, you all really would make good pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** You have no idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** Rick wants to check on Song's body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** Rick checks Song's body?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** Yeah, and I'm going to use my medicine check.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Okay.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:16]** 16 plus, I think, a 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:27]** Yeah, you can tell that their body was hit by some pretty intense cold damage, and they passed pretty quickly.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:29]** It was a one-shot kill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:33]** Can I tell if it was like a weapon fire or like a magic?

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:33]** Weapon fire.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** Okay.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** And nobody had a cold weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:41]** I don't know if you've looked at them yet.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:42]** Have you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:50]** Well, that was going to be my next step before we move any further is trip whatever this redhead is holding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:56]** I thought actually I had already started looking through some of their belongings earlier.

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:03]** That's why they thought that we would make good pirates because I was like, oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** Rick, you look over Song.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:06]** They don't have much on them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** I'm not looting Song's body.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:10]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:13]** You were looking over to see if Song was definitely from the Hail Cannon.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:15]** That's how we got talking about the equipment.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** And then you were like, oh, did we loot them?

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:19]** And then, Dr. Okay, you were looting the bodies.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:24]** So we were just going over quickly because I don't think last time we went over who got what.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** So who got what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:51]** what dr okay picked up a frag grenade and a pistol just a slightly higher uh attack role than my costa jet liquidator that's about it all the other stuff dr okay is not really equipped for do you want to take this tactical pistol yes i will take the fire this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:55]** I will take the heavy armor since it looks like none of you are able to wear that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Yeah, definitely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:02]** So Rick picks up the Golem Forged Plating 1 because it's slightly better than what he has.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:06]** It's going to take a few minutes to put that on and get it fitted right.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:10]** There's a Sub-Zero Hail Cannon there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:13]** That's likely the weapon that took Song out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:18]** Yeah, it makes sense because it's as big as my artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:20]** Yeah, it's a badass weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** Have you seen the automatic fire property?

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:25]** No.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:27]** Do I have to go look this up again, man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Yeah, you should.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:30]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:35]** I was going to say, I'm going to grab the batteries from that unless somebody else wants to pick it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:45]** And then I'm also going to grab the tactical grade X. Can we, like, can I store?

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:50]** If nobody wants the hail cannon, I might want it later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:52]** Yeah, just you're carrying it.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** Just watch your bulk.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:53]** Yeah.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:57]** I can't lock it up in a crate or put it in my room.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** You can lock it up in a crate.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** You can also go put it up in your room.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:07]** But again, when you do, if you leave, things will happen, obviously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:12]** Yeah, I'm also going to drop the storm hammer that we grabbed earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** Yep, the diamagnetic one.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:20]** Because now I'm... How do I... Wait, if you want to give it to me, I can hold on to it and sell it later.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:21]** Sure, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:25]** Yeah, I might even drop this laser pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** Nico?

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** I can't use that.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** You cannot.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:28]** Damn.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:32]** I really want somebody to use it, because if I'm not using it, I want somebody to use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** What, the Stormhammer?

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** Yeah, it's just dope.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** It's just a cool weapon.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:39]** I know, but the Tactical Greataxe is more powerful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** All right, Mr. Midmax.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** I know, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** Here's, can you use that?

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** I'm checking now.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** I don't think so.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:49]** I can only use, like, light weapons, I think.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:51]** I can only use basic melee, yeah.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:55]** Oh, it's a basic, if it's basic melee, then I could, but I don't think it is, is it?

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** It's advanced melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** The hand axes are.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** The hand axes are.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Those are pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:59 - 00:28:59]** The head axe is pretty good.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:01]** They're one-handed.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Oh, two of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** If no one has those, I'll take them.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** Hell yeah.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:04]** Two of them.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** Yeah.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:06]** Thanks.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** She just looks at you and doesn't say anything.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:40]** I guess not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** Gonna take that as a no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:52]** Here's just gonna go over to the downed dwarf and try to wake her up.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** I think she's bound already, isn't she?

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** She's unconscious, stable, bound.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Unconscious, stable, bound.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:58]** Yeah.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** So he will attempt to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Okay.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** So you're gonna go wake her up.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:03]** So you go.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:06]** Maybe you slap her a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:07]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** Wakey, wakey.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** She starts to try and move her hands.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** They're bound, the feet bound.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** She just looks at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** Hey there, welcome back.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** I have a question or two for you.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** They're nice, Godwina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:30]** You can answer any question, says the human pirate.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:35]** The dwarf sits up, leans against the crate that you are...

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** Talking to her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** How do you know me?

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:40]** And what did I do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:42]** What do you mean?

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:45]** How do I know you?

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:52]** How do you not know the pain that you inflicted onto my family?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:56]** Listen, Toots, I've had a really hard time.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:58]** I can't remember everything.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:00]** You gotta give me a little more than this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:06]** She looks at you blankly and then says, how could you not remember?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** I don't know.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** You.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** You killed my family.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** What are their names?

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** Their names.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** It's funny you ask that.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** I go over their names every morning and night.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:23]** A reminder that you killed them.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:25]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** I'm Godwina.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:30]** My husband was Godwin.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:32]** And my son was Godwin Jr.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:36]** And my other son was Godwin III.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** All Godwins.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:39]** Ha ha ha ha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:41]** Good God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:45]** Alright, that was fair.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** Strong name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:49]** Yeah.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:52]** Apparently not strong enough.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:58]** He's going to try to remember.

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** I guess that's wisdom.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:00]** Yeah.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Give me wisdom.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:03]** Good Lord.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:04]** It's just a three.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** Surely he's going to remember this though, right?

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** You don't remember.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** You don't remember at all.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:15]** I gotta say, I don't remember it.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** Sorry, I don't remember it.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:19]** What did I do to them?

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:21]** Supposedly, I did to them.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** You killed them.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** How did I kill them?

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** And when?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** You don't remember this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** I don't.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:30]** Give me a sense motive.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** Here's.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:34]** Smart to roll that.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** Good point.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** 11.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** You're rolling terrible on this.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:41]** I know.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:43]** I should be using a physical dice, that's why.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:43]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:45]** Roll your physical dice next time.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** You can tell she's telling you all that she knows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:52]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:55]** Who told you that I killed them?

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:57]** Did you see it happen or did someone tell you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** She blinks.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:06]** And then turns and looks at the wall blankly as if in thought.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** And she doesn't answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:14]** Okay.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** Well, I'm going to try to convince her to answer me.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:23]** So I'm going to, I guess, try to be diplomatic with her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:29]** Look, maybe if it wasn't me, I could find out who did it.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:33]** And maybe I don't know if I'm feeling generous.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:36]** I can help if you just tell me who told you I did this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:39]** She looks at you and her expression has.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:54]** She's still upset, but there's it's like the mask is kind of broken a little bit and she suddenly seems confused and she just says, I. I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:56 - 00:34:21]** remember and then she turns back and looks at the wall um here's this going to tell her to give everything that she has in her person to him i don't think we checked her yet huh while she was unconscious you did because that's the golem plate yeah that's right and speaking of that rick while that's going on uh rick finishes putting on the golem armor the golem plating


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:26]** and then he walks over to the... Does Redhead have a name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** Yes, she does.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** We never asked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** Does she have a name?

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** Of course she has a name.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** I just go over to the Redhead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:39]** Of course she has a name.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:41]** Yeah, of course her name is Sabrina.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** Sabrina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:48]** So he walks over to Sabrina and he tells her to take off her armor.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:49]** I'm sorry?

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** Take off your armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:56]** And then she just turns around and shows you her cuffed hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:04]** Nico will point his two blasts at her and says, it's okay, I got you covered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:07]** And Rick will undo her...

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:12]** She's wearing, like, a basic, you know, shirt and stuff underneath it.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** And you take the armor.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** It's a second skin armor.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:20]** And as you do that, she looks over at Nico and she says, You know, somebody should really give you a nickname.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:23]** Maybe, like, Quickfire.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** It just came to me.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** One of your guns.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:34]** Nico's going to put one of his lower, one of his guns just a little bit.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** And he's just going to say,

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Do you read minds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** She winks at you.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:47]** So Rick kicks the second skin away from her and then cuffs her.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:55]** Here's going to detect magic on Godwina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** Is that a spell or cantrip?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** It's a cantrip.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:05]** Okay, so just for the listeners at home, Hears and Godwina and Dr. Okay are against the east wall near the door talking.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:11]** Sabrina, Lifeless Song, Rick, and Nico are standing closer to the center of the Starboard Cargo Bay.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** It's maybe been... 48 minutes.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:23]** Well, it's still been about 50, 45, 50 minutes since you all encountered Trostenec and the explosion upstairs.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:29]** And then since the thud down on the wall, it's probably been, I don't know, I'd say 10 minutes.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** Yeah, 10 minutes or so.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** So here's what you're going to do.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** You're going to cast Detect Magic on Galbina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:41]** Yeah, I want to see if there's something making her planting ideas in her head or something like that.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:42]** I did this.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Yeah.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** It has a spell DC of 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** Okay.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** So you need to roll.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** Then let me see that, actually.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:54]** Because I think this is the first time that we're doing detect magic.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:55]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:56]** Read it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:57]** Read it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:06]** You detect all magic spells, effects, items, and objects, including those on or affecting creatures you can see, as well as hybrid items in the area.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:13]** You can't detect magical traps in this way, as they are created with additional magic that wards them from this common spell.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** Um, each round you concentrate on the same area.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:24]** You can determine if one magical source you detect is from a spell magic item or other effect and the caster level or item level of the effect.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:32]** You can't determine if there are magic sources in areas you can't see, or if there was a magic source in an area at one time, but has since expired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:33]** Hmm.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:43]** You can tell, obviously, that none of the weapons or armor that you guys have is magical in the sense that there's like a magical effect per se.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:46]** It's more just like part of the technology that's already in there.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:53]** I think the Sub-Zero Hail Cannon might have some magical components that cause it to cast the cold damage.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:53]** I'm not sure.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:59]** But in terms of what you're really focused on, her, you don't detect any sort of magical spell over her.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:07]** And no, the hail can has a complex integrated coolant system, so you don't detect any magic in or around her.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Rick, Nico, Dr.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** O.K., what are you all thinking?

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** There's been a thud.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** What are you guys doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:41]** uh dr okay who's going to check this door uh and stealthily inspect the hallway open the door and keep down the hallway door opens and you look down the hallway and i will reveal what you see you see uh pretty much five more pirates pointing their weapons at you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:42]** Every time.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:44]** Their names?

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:45]** Godwin.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:49]** Godwin Jr.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** Godwin III.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** We've come for our mother.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** We're not dead after all.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** We were never dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** They've been dead for years.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:03]** You see the hallway and it is empty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** We better get moving.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:09]** Are we taking these two with us or locking them up here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:16]** They say it's easier to take them with us for the tactical advantage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** Nico, what do you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:21]** Nico's going to be, let's do it.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** I agree.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** I got the dwarf.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:30]** And he's going to say to Sabrina, he's going to be like, don't make me live up to my name.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:35]** Don't make me live up to my nickname.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** Oh, no.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** I'm the one who gave it to you.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** I can always take it away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** No, you can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:42]** Take it away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** So you all start to do that.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:54]** I will control them on roll 20 unless I want to give one of you guys control just for the purposes of moving them.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** You can tell me where you want them.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** I'll just give you all control.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** Nick, do you want to move Sabrina or do you want me to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:01]** You got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** We'll move Godwina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** I'm just going to send it to all players.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** Godwina Gryffindor?

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Godwina Gryffindor.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** That is her name.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** Did Song have anything on him?

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:14]** They did not have anything on them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** Ika's going to take this opportunity.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:19]** He's going to reload his azimuth laser pistols.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** Yeah, Rick Wall.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** Change the magazines on him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** So you guys walk out into the hallway.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** You're pushing these prisoners.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** Seems like Godwina is in the center.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:30]** is in front.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** Nico and here's right behind Godwina.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:35]** And you all should be able to move Sabrina as well.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:37]** Let me give them their names.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** The Teenage Witch.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** So we're in the hallway now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:44]** Yeah, the Teenage Witch and Godwina Gryffindor.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:48]** Sabrina Slytherin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** Rick, are you coming?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:51]** Yeah, I'm coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:57]** Rick is just adjusting the... I'm going to peer down this hallway...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:07]** Before Rick walked out of the room, though, he crossed Song's arms over and then closed his eyes all ceremoniously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Closed their eyes.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:11]** Put some pennies on theirs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:14]** Two coins on the eyes for the boatman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** For the boatman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:16]** I was just going to make that reference.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** Are you moving that far ahead?

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:17]** Good call, Nick.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** Good call, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:25]** So now, as a group, we're walking down the hall with the two hostages kind of out in front.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** Okay, the two hostages out in front.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** You all start walking.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** Let me reveal this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:38]** And every once in a while, Rick nudges her in the back with this giant artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:51]** So as you look down the hallway, you can see around the corner, there is another set of improvised boundaries that were there.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** That's showing, right?

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** Yes, I see it.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:57]** Fascinating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** Where did the sound come from?

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:01]** You said the south side of the cargo bay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:05]** Yeah, it sounded like you all can see the gym door in front of you.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:09]** It sounded like it came from the gym, and that was in the comm that came over there.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** Communicative isolation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:17]** We should get in there as quick as we can since it just happened.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** You're going to let Sabrina move in first?

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:23]** So, yeah, Rick will push her to the door.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:25]** Can we see inside through the windows?

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:29]** Because this door here is the gym.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** That is the gym.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:31]** Yeah.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:34]** So I'll tell you what you see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:36]** Natural 20 on perception.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** On perception.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:40]** So 25 for perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** Okay.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** This is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:45]** Great.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:47]** When the GM says, this is good.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** And starts rolling dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:52]** I didn't roll any dice.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** Now I'm going to roll a dice.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:57]** That's 24 for me on perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:59]** It was Nick rolling it.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:01]** I got a 24 on perception to aid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** Okay, nice.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** So that's a plus.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** So that's a 27 for you.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** Are you doing it stealthily?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** Do I need to do it stealthily?

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:10]** Are you?

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** I mean, I'm just looking around and listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** Yes, I'll roll for stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** Dr. O'Kay is rolling for stealth.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** Rick is not rolling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:20]** I'll roll for stealth.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Dr. O'Kay rolled a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** 15 from Dr. O'Kay.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:23]** Rick?

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** 17.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** 17.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** Do you say something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:28]** No.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** I'm going to stick out here for now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:33]** I got a 12 on my stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** I actually, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** What is this door to the left before the barricade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:49]** You recall that as the door that has no window on it, and you were going to go try and open, but I think you guys tried to open it.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** It was in one of the earlier episodes.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:51]** You tried to open it.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** It didn't open.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** That one is locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** We tried engineering checks and everything, and nothing would get it to budge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** I think you didn't want to go forward.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:04]** You were about to really dive in and say, let's try and open this, and it didn't work.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:07]** All right, so you're standing at the door.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:11]** How do I want to do this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:14]** Remember, we heard voices on that other doorway.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** Probably should have checked that out.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** Yeah.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:20]** Give me a... There's so much going on, I don't know which way to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** That's why it's a game.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** You can figure it out.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** Give you what?

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** Everyone give me a wisdom check.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:32]** As you're about to open the door here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:32]** Thirteen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Thirteen as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:34]** Twenty.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** Twenty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:36]** 20.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:36]** 10.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** Okay.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:40]** 10, 20, 13.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** Who got the 20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Here's, what did you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:45]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:47]** 13.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:49]** Okay.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:49]** Dr.

**[00:44:49 - 00:45:00]** O.K., you recall, just as Rick is about to look in, and just as you go up to look in and be stealthy,

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:04]** You think about what was said, the phrasing, the candor.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:06]** You start thinking about the voice.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:10]** You're like, where have I heard this voice before?

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:17]** And you realize that the voice sounded like Lozu.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:28]** And as Rick, as you and Dr. OK go to peer through, you actually see in the gym.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** Oh, what?

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:32]** The gym equipment is strewn all over the place.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** Bikes are knocked over.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** For the listener, he just revealed the room.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:38]** Hold on.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** In the center of the mat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Let's make sure it's not a bug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:52]** In the center of the mat, you see Lozu Pahir, the first mate, unconscious on the ground.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:59]** And standing over Lozu Pahir is Lozu Pahir, the first mate.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:08]** Digging through the pockets to see another Lozu Pahir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** We got a shapeshifter.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** Let's take her down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:16]** Fucking let's do this.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:20]** So we're not an initiative because she didn't see us, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:22]** Yeah, I don't think she saw you.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** You're just looking through the window.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** Do you want to go in?

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:28]** Rick is going to hit the door.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:28]** Hold on.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** Hold on.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:29]** Hold on.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:29]** Hold on.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:30]** Hold on.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:39]** I feel like Rick starts to put his hand up and Dr. Okay's tentacle pushes it down.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:43]** Do you still have that ability to supercharge a weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:50]** So we definitely haven't rested in a while, so we're all pretty taxed.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:58]** But I do have something called a spell cache, which I can use once a day and activate any spell for free.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:01]** So I will do that for Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** I think I got one.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** I was thinking of this for Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** I see where you're going with it.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:11]** He wants you to supercharge my weapon now, and then I'll just send it to the room and open fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:14]** That's a good idea.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:17]** I think I got one just for you, man.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:17]** Right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:21]** And Rick, like, Dr. O'Kate says that out loud.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:25]** And Rick turns to, he hears this huge smile on his face.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:27]** He says, just keep that ready.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** And then he hits the button.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:34]** And he's going to walk in with Sabrina right in front of him.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:34]** Okay.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:37]** And he's holding her handcuffs.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:41]** And as soon as those doors open, he kicks her knee out.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** So she falls to her knees.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** Okay.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** And he rests his artillery laser on her shoulder.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:45]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:54]** And, like, uses her as, like, a shield as he's pointing his artillery laser.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** And he's going to shout, stand down.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** Keep your hands where I can see them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:09]** As you do that, the Lozupe here that is standing up looks, sees this whole scene, this gaggle of people outside.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:11]** You can probably see Nico, Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:18]** Baby Godwina looks over and says, Thank you.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:22]** I was so worried.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:25]** I thought that something might happen.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** It was very scary.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:31]** Clearly, I can see that we look like she is not real.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:35]** She is... I don't know what she is, but I'm very glad that you're here.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:37]** Looks like you're okay, too.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:45]** And at that moment, the low Zooper here that is on the ground...

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:56]** Starts to looks up, sees the Lozu above her and quickly rolls and then sits up with her hands back and says, shoot, shoot, shoot them.

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:00]** They they are there with the pirates.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:03]** And the one standing up says, no, no, she is not real.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:06]** She boarded it and she tried to kill me.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** What do you all do?

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:09]** What do you all do?

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** Rick has terrible sense motive.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:14]** Sense motive.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** All right.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:18]** Rick has 19 sense motive on the standing one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** Rick has no idea, though.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:23]** He's got his artillery laser, and he's just kind of swiveling back and forth at the two of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:26]** I got a 20.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:26]** 20.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:27]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:32]** We're very good at sensing motive right now.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** You're 28.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** Wow, you guys are great.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** We're seeing right through this crap, John.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** Come on.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:39]** Nico, what did you roll?

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:39]** 20.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** 20?

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** Wow, okay, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:45]** 14 plus 6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** Booyah!

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:50]** I'm not going to say who, but you know what one of them rolled on their bluff check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** A little sneak behind the scenes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:53]** Yeah.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:54]** A 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** Oh!

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:57]** Wow.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:59]** So Dr. Okay and Nico...

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** I don't know what it is.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:03]** I don't know if it was her cadence.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:08]** I don't know if it was the way that she spoke, maybe the uncertainty in her voice.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:15]** Maybe it was the fact that the one who was on the ground, which I will just call out here, you are seeing two of them.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:18]** It's the one that is down here, right?

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** She moved back.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** I'll say she like rolled five feet away.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** Yeah.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Who knows what it was?

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:30]** The one who is on the ground is wearing their armor that you've seen her in.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:34]** And the one standing up is wearing station wear that maybe you've seen her in.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** You're like, that's familiar, I guess.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:47]** But you can tell that it's the one standing up that is likely is having trouble passing off the fact that they are Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:48]** Yeah.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:54]** Also, the fact that she was rummaging through unconscious Lozu's pockets is kind of a dead giveaway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:00]** So, yeah, let's waste this person.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:00]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:11]** Nico's going to take... I'm going to say to Rick, it's the one on the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:26]** And the one on the right, as soon as you say that, you see Lozu's mouth move, but the voice coming out is not Lozu, and there's this grin that becomes this sneer, and they say, this is where you draw your last breath.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:28]** Rickle for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:32]** I feel like we should have had advantage on this.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:36]** I mean, as soon as you... It was mostly because you said that, to be honest.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:39]** But they are also willing to attack.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:45]** It actually says in the book that they attacked to possibly surprise you all.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:50]** So the fact that you already knew, I was like, eh, it's... They know what's up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:54]** We're all weird here, kid.

**[00:51:54 - 00:52:02]** I had that spell readied, which was supercharged weapons, so I can do that out of initiative order, correct, for Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:08]** Yes, you can do that out of initiative order.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:08]** Nice.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:10]** You did that, how long did it take to cast it?

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** One round.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** I think it's instantaneous.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** I think it's instantaneous.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:20]** Because you did that in the hallway.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:44]** yeah i did i did very nice all right here's does that uh for rick here you go buddy shoot straight well i'm gonna say that you did that in the hallway so that that's been done it's only good for one round and i and i told him to have it ready that's fine it's six seconds but i'll say with the time that you did it you stepped in this happened it i'll let it mechanically work as if you've done it just now that's fine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:46]** You're the best, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** Hey, you know what?

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:50]** I'm only trying to kill your characters some of the time.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** So don't say that I don't do things for you.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:51]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:54]** You just find more creative ways to kill us is all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:54]** Yeah.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:56]** And then along the way, I give you little things.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** I'm like, hey, it's cool.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** I make it seem like I'm being helpful.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:04]** And really, I just want my characters that I make to destroy you.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:05]** Cool.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** So with that said, that's out of the way.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** Our goals are clear.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:14]** That was our 24th session zero that we've had where I tell you that I want to kill you.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:17]** And what are your initiatives?

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** Rick rolled a nine.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Rick rolled a nine.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:23]** Five from here's.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** Nico, Dr.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:25]** O.K., what did you get?

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:27]** Nico got an 18.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** 18 from Nico.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Nice roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:30]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** got a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** 16.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:34]** Good stuff.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** All righty.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:42]** This is going to be awesome.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** I've been waiting for this.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:45]** So, it's the top of the round.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:49]** The Lozu that you all know to be... Let's call them Not Lozu.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:50]** Not Lozu.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Super creative name.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** Not Lozu.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:55]** You see them.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:59]** Their hands kind of move and start to wiggle.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** And they say something under their breath.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** And then... Oh, no.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:10]** Out of nowhere, their body seems to, like, double...

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:16]** And then as it starts to double, it actually doubles again.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:29]** And so in the same five foot space, you see four of them slightly offset, all looking very solid as they use holographic cologne.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** Oh, no.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** Oh, man.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** Love it.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:35]** So, so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** What does that do?

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** It gives you like a high AC or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:38]** Yeah, it basically, you'll see, you'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:41]** Don't make me look in the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:45]** Don't make me look in the book.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** Is that a spell?

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** Well, I'm not going to say anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** No, you're going to make me Google it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** Well, don't Google.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:56]** That's like just Googling the threefold conspiracy and just reading the whole thing, which you definitely shouldn't do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** I have done so hard.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:02]** I'm fighting so bad not to Google anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:05]** I will say you should definitely not do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:08]** Holographic image.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:08]** I found it.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:13]** But I don't know what level you did it at, so it doesn't matter.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:13]** It's fine.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** Nico, you are up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** What are you doing?

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** Nico is going to do a trick attack.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:21]** So he's going to do a bluff check.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:24]** And he's going to shoot with both blasters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:25]** Okay.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:28]** He's going to trick attack, shoot with both blasters.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:31]** I don't know that you can shoot with both blasters and do a trick attack.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** Why not?

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:36]** Because shooting with both blasters is a full attack, I believe, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:39]** This is how trick attack works.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** Yep.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:46]** So you can trick or startle a foe and then attack when she drops her guard.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:50]** As a full action, you can move up to your speed whether or not you moved.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:56]** You can then make an attack with a melee weapon with the operative special property or with any small arm.

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:03]** So because I'm not moving, I think I could do that because this is before anything else.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** So I see what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** I'm going to say this.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:11]** I think attacking with both weapons could be a full attack.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:14]** Yeah, you spend a full action to make two attacks.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:22]** So you either spend your full action to make two attacks, or you spend your full action to do a trick attack, which involves one weapon attack.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:27]** Just based on the rules, I think that's what that would be.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:29]** Is trick attack a spell or a feat?

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:31]** Trick attack is an envoy thing.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:34]** No, it's an operative thing.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:35]** Sorry, operative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:36]** It's operative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:38]** You all have Dirty Trick.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** Anyone can do a Dirty Trick.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:42]** I think Dirty Trick counts as a standard action.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:45]** But Trick Attack is, I think, a little better, right, Nick?

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** And it's only a move action.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:51]** Well, it's a full action, but you can do it better than anyone else, I think.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** That's the whole point.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:55]** Well, Nico's just going to take both of his blasters, then he's just going to open fire.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:58]** You will have some soft cover because Rick, Dr.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:00]** O.K., and Sabrina are in front of you.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:04]** So not Lozu will have some soft cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:05]** Dang it, John.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** You're just making my life difficult.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:10]** Dude, I'm playing the game as it's meant to be played.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:14]** I will do a trick attack then, and he will do a trick attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:17]** Gosh, John, following the rules.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:18]** I know.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** Horrible.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** I love it, guys.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:21]** Thank you.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** We're an asshole.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:23]** Wow.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:23]** All right.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:24]** Rules lawyer.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** We know you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:27]** So he's going to shoot with one blaster here.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** Okay.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:33]** He's going to do a trick attack, so bluff check first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:37]** Bluff check against the DC is me, right?

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:39]** It's 20 plus the creature CR?

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:40]** Yeah.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:41]** Got it.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:44]** Okay, okay, okay.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** I see what you're doing.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:46]** What'd you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** You're not going to like it, John.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:52]** Oh, I'm going to like it real hard.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:55]** Natty 19 plus 8 for 27.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:59]** Do you want to know what the DC was?

**[00:57:59 - 00:57:59]** What is it?

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:00]** 23.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** You nailed it.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:02]** Booyah.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:04]** What do you do as your trick attack?

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** What's your, like, tricky, tricky thing?

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** Do you shout and be like, hey, look over here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:13]** Nico's going to do that stupid roll.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** Your shoelaces are untied.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:23]** So Nico's going to do that stupid roll again that Rick 19 was just, yeah, that acrobatics roll that Rick 19 was just like, why'd he do that?

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:25]** I love the continuity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Sorry to cut you off.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** Amazing.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:28]** All right.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:30]** So you roll in between them.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:32]** I picture like a Willy Wonka somersault.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:36]** You pop up and you're like, boom, and then you shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:47]** As a little bit of flavor for it, as he rolls between the two and he pops up with one of his blasters upraised, he says, if you somehow manage to survive this, you can call me.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** Quick draw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Quick fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:52]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:52]** Quick fire.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:53]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:55]** You can call me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:57]** You can call me quick fire.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** He's going to shoot.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** That's so funny.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** That's what Sabrina says.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** She's like, it's quick fire, not quick draw.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:04]** Okay.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** I'm trying to nail this.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:07]** All right.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:10]** All right.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** So give me your attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** Quick fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:16]** This was your Atmos laser pistol?

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:16]** Yes.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** And that is a plus three as well.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** So that's a 21 to hit.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** That is a hit.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** Nicely done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:22]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** That's a plus three.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:25]** No, that's not a plus three.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** That's a three to hit.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:27]** That's a three to hit.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** Plus three to her HP.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** So she gains three HP.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:32]** No, sorry, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:36]** Minus three to her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** Minus three to the health.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** And she's flat footed?

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** She's flat footed.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:44]** Plus, wait, I think I also get something else, right?

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:48]** I also have to do an additional D4 here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** Sorry.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** Additional D4.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** Okay.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** Wait, what's the additional D4?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:57]** I get, if I succeed on the trick attack, you are flat-footed and I get another damage die.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** Got it.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** Another D4 here, so.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:02]** Okay, so that's a three.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:04]** And another three, so that's minus six.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** And you're flat-footed.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:05]** Okay.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** This is what I will say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:11]** As you fire... Right?

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:12]** The shots...

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:14]** Hit.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:36]** Niko, as you shoot and fire and say, you can call me quick fire, then you see that the shots hit one of the not-lozus, and that lozu disappears as you hit one of the holographic clones.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** And that is our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:42]** What?

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:43]** Bullshit.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:43]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** Hey everyone, it's Kevin.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:55]** I know you just heard my voice like three weeks ago, but I had to jump back into that rotation a little bit early because this week's a little more personal for me.

**[01:00:55 - 01:01:04]** Around five years ago, about the time that I got married, my wife and I agreed that when I finished school, we would move to the East Coast.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:11]** Well, I finished my master's degree in December and we started planning and we're moving this weekend.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:15]** So by the time next week's episode comes out,

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:19]** I will already be on the road with my wife, my son, and my dog heading that way.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:21]** And I'm leaving the table.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:26]** I'm leaving behind four of my closest friends that I play Starfinder with.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:35]** But the cool thing is that the technology today will allow me to continue playing without any changes.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:44]** I mean, that same technology that we use to start a podcast in the middle of a global pandemic, that same technology will help me stay connected to these guys forever.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:55]** I'm actually going to like phone it in like some kind of super villain meeting with his like table of evil union members or something and play our podcast and put it out to you guys as if nothing has changed.

**[01:01:55 - 01:02:00]** And hopefully you wouldn't even know there was a difference unless you listen to this outro.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:08]** But I also want to take that as an opportunity to tell you as a listener, if you're at all interested in playing, that now is the time to join because there's nothing stopping you.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:15]** And if you're curious, if you're looking for a way to do it, email us, send us something, a message on social media.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:20]** We will help get you connected to the right person to get you playing, even if it's remotely and online.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** So reach out.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** That's all I'm saying.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** Get out there.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:25]** Play a game.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:27]** Yeah, I guess that's it.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** Thank you for listening.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** Thank you for all your well wishes.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:34]** And I'll see you next week on Will Save.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:36]** So thanks again.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:43]** Kevin out.
