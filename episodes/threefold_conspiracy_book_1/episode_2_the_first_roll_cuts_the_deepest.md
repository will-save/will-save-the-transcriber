**[00:00:00 - 00:00:04]** Last time on Will Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:06]** It is said in life that we are all running from something.

**[00:00:07 - 00:00:09]** So too began the tales of our heroes.

**[00:00:10 - 00:00:18]** Here's our Shirin pirate escaped assassination after one of his former crew members gave him a mysterious piece of cargo.

**[00:00:18 - 00:00:18]** Dr.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:28]** O.K., our Osharu researcher, escaped police custody through biochemical methods, only to find his colleague coerced into being abducted.

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:35]** Rick19, our android bounty hunter, experienced a strange memory flash while completing a bounty.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:42]** NikoOrion, our former executive, found himself on the run after narrowly escaping assassination.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:45]** Have our heroes ran from trouble to heaven?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:46]** Find them again?

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on Willsave.


## Jon Swan

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:44]** Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the second episode of Will Save the Podcast.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:52]** I'm John Swan, your Game Master, and I want to briefly monologue about how we have fun here and why I have this odd title.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:56]** You see, we're playing the tabletop role-playing game Starfinder.

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:07]** Surely you've heard of similar games such as Pathfinder or Dungeons and Dragons, but where those take place in a fantasy setting, Starfinder is everything science fiction.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:10]** Aliens and lasers, planets and galaxies, it's all there.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:20]** And what I love is that Paizo, the creators of the game, have developed such rich lore and history that they've even tied it in to their other game, Pathfinder.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:23]** So if any of this sounds like a good time,

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:26]** You've got many worlds and stories to jump into.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** How does one play an RPG, John?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Glad you asked.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:33]** You create a character and put them in an adventure.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** A decision comes up.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:37]** You decide what your character would like to do.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:40]** You roll some dice to see if you do said thing.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:43]** And then the game master continues the story forward...

**[00:02:43 - 00:03:06]** rinse and repeat all the actions your character wants to take are governed by a set of rules if they want to engage in starship combat there are rules for how to pilot and fire weapons how well they do is determined by those dice rolls so want to convince the alien boss to let your friends go roll for it want to attack said boss after not doing so well on your first roll make another roll

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Where do I come in?

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:14]** As Game Master, I neither work in a national park nor a large royal estate, but I do guide the players through the adventure.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:19]** Whereas the players are characters, I will be the world they inhabit.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:25]** Now, this adventure is written into six books collectively called The Threefold Conspiracy.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:27]** Here's the key, and here's where it gets juicy.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:32]** Although the adventure is pre-written, the players' reactions and choices are not.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:35]** Nothing about their reactions or decisions is pre-planned.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:39]** Anything could happen as the players decide how to respond.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:45]** This is the actual play in the succinctly named genre, actual play tabletop role-playing game podcast.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:51]** And as I like to say, whenever the players respond, the world responds in turn.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:55]** To tell you a bit about myself, I'm an acoustics consultant and professional musician.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:59]** My role-playing days started when I learned D&D from my dad.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** Thanks, dad!

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** And also started playing with my friends in school.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:06]** We kept playing throughout high school and eventually stopped as we graduated.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:12]** Then a few years ago, thanks to the age of non-dial-up internet, we started playing together again.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]** But I missed playing in person.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:18]** That feeling of shouting at little math rocks around a table late into the night.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** Around that time, I meet my friend Kevin.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** who had just started playing D&D.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:31]** I introduced him to my friends Nick and Will, who introduced me to Kelly, and we started a group chat that went something like, let's play.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:36]** Little did I know that those words would lead us to start a Starfinder podcast.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:46]** Now, maybe you, dear listener, are deep into your own character or campaign, or maybe you're new to role-playing games and you got lucky by stumbling upon our podcast.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:48]** Well, even though we are still newish...

**[00:04:48 - 00:05:11]** to the game and always learning we love starfinder and think everyone should enjoy its epic space opera adventures so regardless of where you are in your gaming journey we're going to make sure we keep everyone in the loop by explaining rules and gaming concepts throughout our episodes this way when you inevitably start playing yourself you'll know what's going on

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:17]** With that said, if you like anything you hear, please give us a review wherever you enjoy podcasts.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:19]** It's amazing how far one review can take us.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:27]** So the more that you offer, the more that we can share Starfinder and share this ragtag band of players with everyone.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:36]** So that means tell your friends, your family, your gaming group, that person that you always nod to with your headphones in on the commute in the morning and then oddly enough in the evening as well.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** Let them know.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** Or let us know.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:42]** Maybe you've got a favorite moment from the first episode.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:46]** Email us at willsavethepodcast at gmail.com.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** Maybe we made a mistake with the rules.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:52]** That does happen because I noticed one last episode with calculating kinetic armor class.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** Did you notice it too?

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:56]** Then why didn't you tweet and Instagram us?

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:01]** We're on all social media except for MySpace, alas, with the handle at willsavethepodcast.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:06]** And you can check out our website, willsavethepodcast.com for more.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Finally, a quick note.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:14]** If you've played in or run the Threefold Conspiracy, you know how awesome and mysterious it can be.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:24]** So I'd ask those listeners to avoid any spoilers or hints anywhere the players might see them, especially if they ask you.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:30]** Just tell them, no clues for you, you pesky meddling players, and then we'll all have a good time.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:41]** Once again, thank you for enjoying episode one, deciding to start episode two, listening through me saying hello three times, and then winding up here at the end of an intro that you didn't know was coming.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** So what are we waiting for?

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:44]** Let's play.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** So last time, last week,

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:59]** We jumped right into the story.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:09]** We were just head first, nose first, just no messing around, no horsing around, just good old-fashioned start.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:19]** So I think it might be good if we introduce ourselves to our listeners.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:24]** So you might've heard me on the little GM clip in the beginning.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:28]** So I think we'll introduce the players.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:31]** So to my virtual right here.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:35]** We've got Mr. Kevin Decker.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:38]** A little round of applause for old Kevin Decker here.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** Yay!


## Kevin Decker

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** Oh, thank you.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** Thanks.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:42]** What a mess.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:45]** So, hi, everyone.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** I'm Kevin Decker.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:54]** So I was born and raised in California, and I'm currently an engineer for the space industry.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Convenient.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** And I'm also a newborn.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** No, I'm the father of a newborn.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** I'm not a newborn myself.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** I'm a newborn.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** Uh, I'm a newborn.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** Yeah.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:07]** I'm a recent father as in like two weeks ago, three, almost three weeks.

## Will Garrett

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** No webbed feet, though.

## Will Garrett

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** I am Will.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:43]** No relation to Will Save.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:44]** No relation.


## Jon Swan

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:46]** Totally, total coincidence.


## Will Garrett

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:47]** Yeah.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** It's a different person.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** It really is.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** And it's not me.


## Jon Swan

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:56]** Easily confused, though, for sure.


## Will Garrett

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Easily confused.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** I thought your last name was saved, though.

## Jon Swan

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** Yes.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:51]** It is important to note that we are recording this remotely due to COVID.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** Cause we're going to help Will out with that.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:54]** Yeah.


## Jon Swan

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:56]** Cause that beer would not be an issue.


## Will Garrett

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** I either, or I need to become a serious alcohol.


## Jon Swan

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:00]** No alcoholism.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** That can only go one of two ways.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:06]** Either the podcast becomes a lot more interesting or we stop recording.


## Will Garrett

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** Not to alienate any friends of Bill.


## Jon Swan

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** All right.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:18]** Next up in my little windowed pane at the top of our Zoom meeting is Mr. Nicholas Belcher.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:20]** How we doing, Nick?


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** Yeah, Nick.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:25]** It's a quiet Saturday.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** I'm doing all right.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:31]** I guess I need to talk a little bit about myself here.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** That's really hard.


## Will Garrett

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:36]** It is for some.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:36]** I'm Nick Belcher.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:39]** It's a quiet Saturday afternoon and I'm loving life.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** A little bit about myself.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:49]** I work as an outside sales rep, currently for a credit card processing company, but in the market for something else at the moment.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** Fun fact about me, I used to be a musician.


## Will Garrett

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:54]** You still are a musician.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:56]** It's like joining the Marines.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:59]** You're never not a musician, Nick.

**[00:11:59 - 00:11:59]** Yeah, Nick.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:01]** There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** Is that how it is with the Navy too, Kevin?

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:07]** Once you're out, you're always still part of the Navy.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** Are you still a sailor, Kev?

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:11]** I will always be a submariner.


## Jon Swan

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:13]** Yeah.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** You'll always be a submarine, Kev.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** Submariner?

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** You'll always be a submarine.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** Submarine.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:21]** Is it that horrible an experience where you bond over it?


## Kevin Decker

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** I'm a newborn submarine.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** Kev's a newborn submarine.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** My name is Kelly.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:05]** Like Will, I am a computer nerd for a living.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:14]** And I get a lot of flack for my pink headphones, which have cat ears, but also a lot of love because they're very nice.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** Who gives you flack?

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:16]** No one here gives you flack.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:19]** Initially, and then everybody realized that they're great.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** No, we love them.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** We've always loved your headphones.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** Okay, good.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** Let the record show.


## Will Garrett

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:28]** I thought my eyes deceived me for it was so wondrous.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:31]** I'm glad you found your ear back.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** You lost an ear for a while.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** I finally found one.


## Jon Swan

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:34]** The ear got clipped.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** You got tagged.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:39]** It's like a fake one, but it looks pretty good, right?


## Kevin Decker

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Because they're stray cat headphones.


## Jon Swan

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** Yeah, because you're a stray cat, Kelly.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** That about sums me up.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:50]** These guys adopted me.


## Jon Swan

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:54]** All right, well, we got a stray cat, a newborn submarine, somebody looking for work, and Will.


## Will Garrett

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** So it sounds like we're all set.

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:00]** I want to redo my fun fact that I could be an extra in Duck Dynasty.


## Jon Swan

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:01]** You could.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:08]** The way you look right now, for everyone who's listening, which is everyone except for us, then, yeah, he's got a huge beard.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** And a great B. And a nice cap.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:12]** Great distinction.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** Yeah, thanks.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:15]** I thought it was important to make that distinction.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** And a cap.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** And a cat or a cap?


## Will Garrett

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** Oh, a cap.


## Jon Swan

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** Yeah, a cap.


## Will Garrett

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:23]** That's it.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** That's it.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** Ninja is here asleep.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** I don't want to wake him.


## Jon Swan

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:32]** Well, Ninja is one of the podcast cats, so it's good.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** It's all good.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:36]** And so that people know, Ninja is kind of a famous cat.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:40]** He's got his own... He's on Instagram.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:43]** Yeah, throw his handle out there.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:45]** He's very familiar with that cat.


## Will Garrett

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:50]** GingerNinji with a Y on the end is the handle.

**[00:14:51 - 00:15:18]** beautiful you can see him do dice tower rolls yep on our on our instagram yeah yeah yeah he he is a cool cat i will and i'm not i'm not even a fan of cats really but ninja i'm a fan yeah me neither but like somehow he stole my heart says the guy with the cat yeah i don't like cats i don't like cats but for my headphones it's fine it's a long story yeah oh yeah totally


## Kevin Decker

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:24]** Speaking of cats, John Swan has two cats.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Who's this John Swan fellow?

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:27]** Yeah, I do have two cats.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** We don't talk about one of them.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:28]** I don't know.


## Jon Swan

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:33]** Okay, so one of them is Penelope, and she's an angel.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:34]** She's fantastic.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:39]** And the other is Terrence, and he has a mustache, and he is... He's an asshole.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:39]** He's an asshole.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:41]** Oh, that's why we know that.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:41]** I didn't even need to finish it.


## Will Garrett

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** I didn't even need to finish it.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:46]** He is an asshole because he has a mustache.


## Jon Swan

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:55]** So, to test this theory, I currently have a beard, but I should shave and get a mustache and see if I'm a meaner GM.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** That's how that works, right?


## Will Garrett

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:00]** I don't think we need to do that.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:05]** I prefer you with a full beard.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** You look so much better with a beard, John.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:15]** Like, John, if you shaved your beard but not your mustache, I would have to flag you at every single Chuck E. Cheese you walked into.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** Is Chuck E. Cheese still a thing?

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** I feel like COVID wiped them out.


## Jon Swan

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:20]** Yeah, I feel like they're wiped out along with their carpet pizza.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:24]** Which is funny because they should have been wiped out long before.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:28]** No, didn't you hear they tried to pass themselves off as like a fake pizza joint and they got caught?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** What?

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:32]** What do you mean?

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** What?

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:35]** This is the news section of our podcast.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:45]** No, I thought they got slammed for false advertisement because they were trying to sell their Chuck E. Cheese pizzas under a different name or something like that.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Interesting.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:50]** You guys can fact check me on that, but I'm pretty sure that happened.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:53]** You're just going to get hate mail from everybody who loves Chuck E. Cheese.


## Will Garrett

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:57]** Can I tell a story about Chuck E. Cheese?

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** Yeah, please.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:03]** I went to Chuck E. Cheese with my wife on a date once.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** For the first date?

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:06]** No, it was like third or fourth date.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:11]** And it was amazing because it's like super cheap beer.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:13]** The food is whatever.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** Their pizza's fine.


## Will Garrett

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** Their pizza's fine.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:21]** Yeah, it's not like... We just lost five people.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:28]** But you could... It's not like Dave & Buster's where, like, there's a million... Like, every game's a million dollars.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** Mmm.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:40]** And if you're in it to win tickets, you could just, like, hover over small children and, like...

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:57]** swoop in when you're about to like all those chance games you just totally clean up that sounds like fatherly advice I'm looking forward to taking him to Chuck E. Cheese did you go in like the play pins and stuff


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:58]** With him?

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** Yeah, I have an excuse to go.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** Oh, no, I mean, Will.


## Will Garrett

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:05]** What did I do?

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:07]** Did you go into the play pens with your now wife?

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** No, no, I did not.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:12]** No, we mostly just played arcade games.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:24]** And when the little kids would run out of quarters on the chance games, we had to swoop in and get the most tickets.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** I got a story about Chuck E. Cheese.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** It's less of a story, just more of a, I don't know, thing.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:35]** There was a Chuck E. Cheese literally in the same parking lot of my comic book shop that I used to go to right out of high school.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:38]** And so I had a friend that worked at that Chuck E. Cheese.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:41]** So every time I went to go get comics on Wednesdays when they came out.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:47]** I would walk over to Chuck E. Cheese and get cotton candy and then go back to the comic shop.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** Cotton candy is my thing.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:49]** I'm just saying.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** It's good.


## Jon Swan

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** That is your second fun fact.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** You realize that, Kev?


## Kevin Decker

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** My first fun fact wasn't really a fact.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:59]** That you're a baby submarine, that is a fact.


## Jon Swan

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** Yeah, that you're a baby submarine.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:05]** No one can see you when they're listening to you, but we can see you.


## Jon Swan

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:08]** Yeah, so you could be a baby submarine and no one would know.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:13]** Can we all just take a moment of silence here for our dear friend Discovery Zone?

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:16]** Comment F to pay respects to Discovery Zone.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:18]** Oh, Discovery Zone.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** I know.


## Will Garrett

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:23]** Go in DZ at Discovery Zone.


## Jon Swan

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:27]** Oh, I'm going to cut out the audio right when you sing that, so it's just your voice.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** That was awesome.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:30]** Wasn't there another one, like G3 or something?

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:36]** There was Discovery Zone and Chuck E. Cheese, and then there was like a G3 or some other...


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:39]** It was, it was three, right?


## Kevin Decker

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:39]** I don't remember.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:46]** It was like DZ, but it was like a, a off brand of it that had, you know, games and toys and ball pits and stuff.


## Will Garrett

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:47]** Hmm.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** Do you guys know about giggles and hugs?


## Kevin Decker

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** What's that?

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:53]** This is a learning session.


## Will Garrett

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:55]** It's like, do I want to tell my kids to that?

**[00:19:56 - 00:20:01]** It's like the Whole Foods of, like, play places.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** What?


## Jon Swan

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:03]** Whole Foods?

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** No, thank you.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:07]** That's a way to sell it.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:07]** Okay.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** It's all hypoallergenic material.


## Will Garrett

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** Chuck E. Cheese for hipsters?


## Will Garrett

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:15]** Like, all the toys are just, like, wood blocks.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:20]** That would be really, really sad.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:20]** Montessori.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:21]** Yeah, exactly.


## Will Garrett

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:23]** Google giggles and hugs, man.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:25]** All right.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** You Google beagles and hugs.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** So back to Will Save.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** So, yeah.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** I linked in.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:39]** I went to LinkedIn and searched for William Save, and there is one student that is a medical assistant school in Hawaii.


## Jon Swan

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** All right.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** I just booked my flight.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:44]** We're going to go meet this guy.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:47]** Yeah, we're going to go meet him and convince him to get off of LinkedIn so we can have –

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** That's based on LinkedIn.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:52]** And then there's a Billsave who's the owner of WetSharp.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:55]** Billsave sounds like... Wait, the owner of what?

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** WetSharp?

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** I'm assuming it's a knife company.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** WetSharp.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:04]** Billsave sounds like a sharpening company.


## Will Garrett

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:04]** Yeah.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:10]** He's in Melbourne, Australia, so maybe Sharp is what Australians call knives.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:14]** Is that what they call knives?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Silly Australians.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** Silly, silly Australians.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** Da-da-ding-a-wee-show-bye-may.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:25]** We lost all the Australians.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:27]** Are you... Yeah, we lost everybody.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:31]** Are you doing a... You're going to have to cut that.


## Will Garrett

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:33]** Are you doing a Moira impression from Schitt's Creek?

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** Oh, what a great show.


## Jon Swan

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:43]** I've heard something.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:50]** She has the best enunciation and articulation of anyone.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** We could all learn something.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:52]** We could.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** Is it good?

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** Let's talk about learning something.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** Is that why she got the Emmy?


## Jon Swan

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:02]** So just wanted to plug a little couple things here from Starfinder by Paizo.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:08]** We threw around some terms last time that were like kind of, you know, if you know, you know, right?

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** Little Starfinder terms.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** We didn't take the time to explain them.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:15]** So I thought just real quick, I'm just going to talk through them.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:20]** Might get some audience participation from you guys here if you want.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:23]** We're going to use the raise hand feature on Zoom?

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** This, yes.


## Jon Swan

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** This is the beta development of raise hand.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** No, wait if you want to use it.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:29]** All right.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** We talked about – All right.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** I'm going to actually do it.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** Thank you, Nick.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:36]** So we talked about – this will be real quick.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:41]** So if this sounds like super nerdy to you, you can probably skip ahead like two minutes and then you'll be fine.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:44]** So we talked about the packed worlds.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** That term might have come up.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:49]** Think of that as the immediate solar system in Starfinder.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:52]** There's one sun, 13 planets.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** The third planet is the most important.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:58]** The third planet from the sun, it's the most important one just like earth.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** So all the other planets are dumb.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:25]** now near space we talked about that as well this is think of this as like if uh as the galaxy said in the catholic church long time ago if we are in the center right the near space is like the next concentric circle around it right so it was kind of unknown until about 3ag that's after gap right

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:30]** The gap is this moment where everyone realized that they forgot the past thousands of years that had happened.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** So everyone woke up.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:41]** Three years later, this tripartite AI god, Triune, sends out what's called the signal and gifts the galaxy.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:48]** with knowledge of the drift, this hyperspace dimension that allows for travel over vast distances, right?

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:53]** So locations that are maybe only a few days or a week away are kind of near space.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:56]** Those further are called the vast.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** Absalom Station, we talked about that, right?

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** That's that third location from the sun.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:07]** Used to be called Galarian in the Pathfinder world, also by Paizo.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:11]** And at some point through the gap, vanished.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:15]** Because now there's only a space station where the planet used to be.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:15]** Why?

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:17]** We don't know.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** We talked about Vesk.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:25]** I believe there were some backstories, some stories that use the Vesk.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** They're from the Veskarium in near space.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:32]** Think of them as like, let's see, a reptile person, right?

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** A lizard person.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** What about Shirin?

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:42]** Kelly, do you want to give us a little quick rundown on what Shirin are?

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** What do they look like?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:50]** Shirin are tall, lanky, bug-like creatures.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:54]** They have honeycomb eyes, the sort of which you'd see on a fly or a spider.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** A few antennae.

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:03]** And they were, until not too long ago, a hive-mind race.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:06]** So like with one unimind.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:18]** but since then have developed a sense of individual identity and therefore kind of like each one of them is discovering this new like found individualism in like really interesting ways.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** Yeah.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** And, yeah.


## Jon Swan

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:24]** Yeah, that's a great summary.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:35]** They used to be part of what's called the Swarm, which were, you know, some years ago threatened the galaxy, this, like, horde of bugs.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:37]** And part of them broke off, and those are the Shirin.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:40]** We talked about LaShunta.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:43]** Special Agent LaRue is the LaShunta.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:46]** They're from one of the planets in the Pac-World called Castravel.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:50]** And there are two types of Lashunta, Demaya and Karasha.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:56]** She's a Demaya, so she tends to be a little bit more focused on mechanically intelligence.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** Let's do one more.

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** Let's talk about Osharus.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:01]** Androids?

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:02]** What?

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** Just want to talk about Osharus.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** We didn't talk about androids.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:07]** Okay, we'll talk about androids in just a minute.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:10]** But let's talk about Osharus real quick, Will.


## Will Garrett

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:18]** Uh, the Asharu are a slug people from the planet of Pabak.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** Payback.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:20]** Pabak.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** P-A-B-A-Q.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** Thank you, Paizo.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** Uh...

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:32]** It's a university planet filled with the dominant race of slugs.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** And there's different types of slugs.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:39]** All Usharos vary in some degree.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** Generally short.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** How short?

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:47]** Four to five feet.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** Okay.

**[00:26:49 - 00:27:03]** The planet has lots of cities where most of the residents live, and they've constructed armies of AI-controlled drones, and they...

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:32]** prefer to keep their drones like you know patrolling using non-lethal means of tranquilizing dangerous creatures and depositing them in the wild uh outside of the cities casual totally casual you know like have you ever seen those documentaries where they like tranquilize polar bears yes in in like canada and alaska and then they like put them in polar bear jail and starve them that's what the the asharu do


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:35]** I remember very much that when you showed it to me.


## Will Garrett

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:38]** Wow.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** What a topic.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** We had a vibrant work culture.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** Let's talk about androids.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** I know how to feel about those.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** Yeah, let's talk about androids here.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** Well, just a note for the audience.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:53]** Will and Kelly used to work together at the same tech company.


## Jon Swan

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:56]** Kelly got cat ears and Will was like, no more.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** I'm done with this.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:58]** I'm done.

**[00:27:59 - 00:27:59]** I'm out.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:00]** I'm out.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:06]** All right, Kev, do you want to draw some knowledge on androids?


## Kevin Decker

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:09]** Oh, heck yeah.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** Here's my story about androids.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:15]** They are complex technological creations crafted to resemble humans.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:21]** Androids were originally a servitor race, but they have since broken free to form their own society.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:27]** Unlike ordinary robots or ship-aid eyes, androids do not simply respond according to their programming.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:37]** Rather, they have independent consciousness and are animated by souls, a distinction crucial to their generally accepted status as people rather than property.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:42]** Thank you, Starfinder Player Handbook.


## Jon Swan

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** Core rulebook.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:47]** Only you can tell us exactly what androids are.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:57]** All right, well, that was a little bit more than two minutes, but that was a good little recap of some things that maybe all the other nerds or non-nerds listening.

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:03]** And if you're just tuning in because you skipped that section, then we're going to get down to the story here.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:13]** So when we last left our adventurers, they were patiently waiting, being politely questioned.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:22]** By Special Agent LaRue of the stewards in Docking Bay 18 of Legacy Station in near space.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** You all should remember that.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:27]** Boarding a ship called the Chimera.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:32]** All of you on your way to Absalom Station, heart of the packed worlds.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** See, I'm dropping all those terms.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** You're being questioned.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:39]** We saw a little bit about what was going on.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:50]** You oversaw maybe a tense moment between Algiada Iom, the chief security officer of the Chimera, and a hobgoblin, another passenger.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:57]** And then you saw maybe a little bit of a nice, sweet moment between Algiada and Avesk.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:04]** So with that said, I want to, one, thank Roll20 for being phenomenal.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:10]** And I also want to thank Syrinscape for providing incredible music all the time.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:16]** Some of this music Nick and I have composed ourselves, but a lot of it is Syrinscape.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:18]** So beautiful, so good, so tear-jerking.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:22]** And with that said… That's their new marketing campaign.


## Jon Swan

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** Hashtag marketing campaign.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:28]** And with that said, we are going to go to the map.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** I'm dragging you guys over here.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:42]** Right at that last moment, if you guys want to tune in to Roll20, right at that moment as we ended, a figure came out of the entrance to the chimera.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:45]** asking what was going on.

**[00:30:46 - 00:31:00]** And one of the other passengers that you were waiting with, a Kasatha, pushed Special Agent LaRue, shoved her onto the ground, knives in two of her hands, the other two hands, outstretched.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** And I think you all know what's going to happen.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:11]** And that's that for the first time on We'll Save, we're going to roll for initiative.


## Cast

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:12]** Fuck.


## Jon Swan

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:38]** let's do it no explanation nothing huh oh i got a 20. wow okay wow dang all right hold your horses here we're gonna we're gonna do this in good old-fashioned order here but that's beautiful that's beautiful all right let's see how we got will you said no explanation and i think you're talking about how dr okay must be feeling


## Will Garrett

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:42]** Standing there in Hangar 18.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** What's going on here?

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** I rolled a nine.


## Jon Swan

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:47]** You rolled a nine.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** All righty.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:51]** Let's throw that in the old tracker here.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:54]** What about you, Mr. Nico Orion?

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** What'd you get?


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:58]** That's a solid 17.


## Jon Swan

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:00]** Oh, that is solid.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:01]** Nice.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** What about Mr. Hears?

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:04]** Hears.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** Got a 20.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** You said 20.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** Just 20 flat?

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** Just flat 20.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** Flat 20.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:15]** And what about you, Rick?


## Kevin Decker

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:20]** I rolled a 4, but I have a plus 8, so that gives me a 12.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:21]** Wait, what?

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** A plus 8 initiative?

## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** Wait, what?

## Kevin Decker

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:28]** Yeah, I don't know what I did.


## Jon Swan

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:31]** How is that possible?


## Kevin Decker

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** Does it break it down for me?


## Will Garrett

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:36]** Yeah, if you click on the number, it should break it down.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:43]** I got a plus four from dexterity and a plus four for one of my bonuses, which is improved initiative.


## Will Garrett

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** Holy!

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** Wow.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:47]** It makes sense for a killer android.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:47]** It does.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** For a murder bot.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** I'm not a killer!


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** Murder, murder, murder, murder.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** You guys don't know I'm a murder bot yet?

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:54]** I'm not a killer.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:56]** Murder, murder, murder, murder.


## Jon Swan

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** All right.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** Let's go to the initiative tracker here.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:04]** Well, now that we have initiative orders... Oh, that's... Thank you so much.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:15]** I was just going to explain to anybody who might be new to Starfinder and RPGs that initiative is how quick you are to act.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** based on your dexterity roll.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** If anybody wants to add to that, they can.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:23]** It just allows us to say, in the order of combat, who goes first.


## Will Garrett

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** Who's quickest to the draw.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:30]** It is a random dice roll to see how quick your reflexes are.


## Jon Swan

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:34]** Thank you to all the dice makers out there for the great work that you do.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:36]** We're not necessarily looking for sponsorships.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** Do we need to explain each dice?

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:40]** But we do like some.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** We do.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:44]** What is your dexterity...

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:49]** What is your dexterity bonus?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:53]** Here's does not have one of those dexterity bonuses.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:53]** Oh, all right.


## Jon Swan

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:54]** Plus zero.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** Plus Zed.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:55]** All right.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** So are you all seeing this map here?

**[00:33:59 - 00:33:59]** Yes.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Cool.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** We do.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:01]** All right.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** Good, good.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:05]** So you know who's going to go first?

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:08]** Magwa, the bad guy.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:10]** The Kasatu who started all this.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Is he going to go first?


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** Yeah.


## Jon Swan

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:24]** And having pushed Special Agent LaRue over, she's going to take a step towards Special Agent LaRue and take the two knives that are in two of her hands.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:30]** And she's going to take a swing at Special Agent LaRue.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** Let's see what happens.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:39]** I am rolling with my threefold conspiracy dice set.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:42]** And I legit roll the natural 20.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** Woo!

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:46]** What a first roll from me.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:49]** Man, that is great.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:52]** Do you have a plus eight modifier to your attack roll there too?


## Jon Swan

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:56]** I cannot confirm nor deny any of that question.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** So thank you for asking.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** That's a critical hit, right?

**[00:34:59 - 00:34:59]** Sorry?

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** That's a critical hit?

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** That is a critical hit.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:08]** Does anybody want to explain how critical hits work in Starfinder while I'm pulling up some of the AC here?

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:10]** Critical hits mess you up.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:27]** You can either draw a card – we either draw a card that gives us a specific effect or somewhat of a debilitation or it's kind of dealers – it's kind of the person who rolled the critical roll there.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:32]** They either get to choose for either the card or the high damage.


## Will Garrett

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:35]** Also, certain weapons have critical effects.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:41]** They can be special properties that are imparted when a critical role is achieved.


## Jon Swan

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:45]** I think for this, we're going to do double damage.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** The old standard.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Sounds like a WWE.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** Double damage!


## Will Garrett

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:54]** John, does it frighten you that you're about to kill your own character?


## Jon Swan

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:58]** Yeah, it's one of those things where you're kind of playing against yourself.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:00]** You're like playing chess against yourself.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:02]** Does an NPC like yourself ever experience fear?


## Jon Swan

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:07]** So I'm rolling twice and then adding the bonuses here.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Not bad.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:08]** Not bad.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:09]** We're cool.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** Cool.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:10]** Don't trip.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:13]** All right, you know whose turn it is?

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:20]** Because Magwa steps forward, stabs down right into the gut of Special Agent LaRue.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:29]** She lets out a scream, and you can see on the top half of Magwa's face, as the Kasafin, the lower half of their face is covered.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:31]** It's like a cultural tradition for them.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** Her eyes seem to burn with an intensity.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** And it's Hears' turn.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** What are you doing?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:39]** Hears is like, I don't have time for this.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:45]** And shoots magic missile right at this new enemy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** Oh!

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:48]** Wow.


## Jon Swan

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:51]** Just going right for it.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:52]** All right.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** You're casting magic missile.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** What happens with magic missile?

**[00:36:56 - 00:37:04]** So with magic missile, you fire two missiles of magical energy that always strike their target.


## Jon Swan

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Always without fail.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:06]** Without fail.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:11]** And so it's really, like, sometimes OP spells awesome.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:16]** And it deals, like, 1d4 plus 1 force damage for each missile.


## Jon Swan

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** So you're rolling a d4.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Are you doing it as a full action?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** In this case, I have two missiles.


## Jon Swan

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** Okay.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** Yeah.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:26]** If you do a full round action, you get an extra missile attack.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:29]** So you get three missiles instead of two.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:32]** I did not see that, but I will.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** You're like, absolutely.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** Oh, yeah, you're right.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:34]** I did see that.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:35]** Absolutely.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** I'm going to take that up.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:36]** All right.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:40]** So I'm going to do three D4 plus one.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:44]** And that comes out to eight in total.


## Jon Swan

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** Eight damage.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** Eight damage.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:47]** Wow.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:49]** That's a lot of damage.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:51]** It's a lot of damage.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** Take that.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** Wow, you don't even know why she didn't.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:58]** You're just like, I'm going to mess you up.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** I have places to go.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** I have places to be.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** You're making me late here.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** You know whose turn it is?

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:10]** It is the individual, another Kasatha, who stepped out of the chimera.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:19]** And this individual, this individual, sorry, steps forward and says, Everybody get down!

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:23]** Steps out, pulls out,

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:54]** blaster he takes a shot where's my d20 here aims you all are standing there you feel like a shot go over your head and my next roll was a critical failure as you hear him start to curse and it sounds like he's pulling the trigger and it's clicking whatever gun he's using is clicking if you look over he's trying to look in at it it is nico orion's turn what are you doing


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:57]** Nico's kind of looking at all this, and he doesn't have a dog in this fight.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** He doesn't have a dog in this fight at all.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** He doesn't care what's going on.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:04]** He's kind of watching with interest, with caution.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:11]** But his hand drifts a little bit closer to one of his azimuth laser pistols, but he does absolutely nothing.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:16]** Just mild amusement that there's just more ruckus going on in the background.


## Jon Swan

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** Okay.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** Okay.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** So doesn't do anything.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:22]** Withholds in action.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:22]** Yeah.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:22]** Yeah.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** Yep.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:24]** All right.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Wow.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:26]** You know whose turn it is?

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:35]** It is Special Agent LaRue on the ground having been stabbed with a Kasathan standing over her.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:42]** She shouts and screams and then she turns to all of you and says, Don't kill him!


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** Don't kill him!

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** Don't!

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** Don't kill him!


## Jon Swan

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:54]** And at that same time, she tries to reach out and grabs for a baton that's strapped to her hip.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:58]** And she's going to swing that baton out.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** Let's see what happens.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** That is a hit.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:10]** You see her kind of fumble down, grab the baton, try to pull it in her hand, and she swings it.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:13]** It hits Magwa in the face.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Gets slapped over.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:18]** And that is going to be some damage.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:24]** It is the individual who's standing here.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** If you're on roll 20, I'm going to ping it.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:39]** The older man with the cybernetics, he takes a few steps back, looks afraid, shocked, completely unprepared for what just happens and steps back against the wall.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** Rick, what are you doing?


## Kevin Decker

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:47]** Rick with his lightning fast speed, he pulls a gun out from his waistband.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:55]** And just as a note, he has a plus one for his base attack, so he can draw a weapon and move at the same time.


## Jon Swan

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** Thank you for that point of clarity.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:57]** That was good.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** But Rick is going to move to here.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** To there.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:02]** Okay.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:05]** And then he's going to use Covering Fire.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:11]** So you can use your standard action to make a ranged attack that provides covering fire for an ally.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:15]** Make a ranged attack roll against a 15 AC.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:28]** If you hit, you deal no damage, but the selected ally gains a plus 2 circumstance bonus to their AC against the next attack from a creature in your line of effects.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** As long as the attack occurs before your next roll.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:31]** Okay.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:34]** So who are you doing covering fire for?

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:38]** I'm going to consider Special Agent LaRue as my ally.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:41]** Okay.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:45]** So I'm going to use her as my ally.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:45]** Give her the bonus.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:49]** Peace.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:54]** So... So how much... That's going to be with my semi-automatic tactical pistol.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:54]** Okay.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:57]** I have a plus five to attack.


## Jon Swan

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** And what is your roll?

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** Eight.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:00]** Eight?

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** I rolled a three.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:04]** Oh, so how does that look?

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** What happens with that?


## Kevin Decker

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:18]** So, yeah, Rick draws his gun out and kind of strafes along that path, and he pulls the trigger to try to distract this creature.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:25]** He doesn't target the creature because he doesn't want to hurt them, but he's just trying to—that's what covering fire is for.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:29]** So he's just trying to distract them, but he just doesn't get their attention whatsoever.


## Jon Swan

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** Yeah, she doesn't seem to notice.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** You fire, and her head doesn't move at all.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:36]** Amogwa's head doesn't move whatsoever.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** Good try, though.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** Dr.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** O.K., what are you doing?


## Will Garrett

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** Um, Dr. O.K.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:51]** is going to draw his cost-jet liquidator firearm.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:55]** Wait, sorry, can you repeat what that firearm is?

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** A what?

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** Cost-o-ject...

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** Wow.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** Okay.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** That sounds intense.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** Yes.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:08]** And I'm going to load it with a pharmacological inhibitor.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** Oh.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** Of course.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** So...

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:23]** I'm trying to look up the mechanics, though, on injecting a target with a drug.


## Jon Swan

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:24]** Okay.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:28]** I think if you hit on the attack roll, then that's what counts.


## Will Garrett

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:32]** Okay, so it's basically like the attack roll?

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** Yeah.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:37]** I'm sure the comment section on this will be like, no, you're doing it all wrong.


## Jon Swan

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:46]** So yeah, I'm trying to open the care dropper operations manual, but as soon as you make the attack, we're going to consider it like, you know, you're taking your hand off the chest piece.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:46]** So you're fine.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:50]** So what is your attack role on that?

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:51]** 18.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** 18!

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** Yeah, you shoot.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** Where are you aiming?

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:58]** Because you pretty much hit wherever you wanted to aim.


## Will Garrett

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:02]** I'm going to aim for this gentleman's neck.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Sorry, which gentleman?

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** This guy.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:09]** Next to Agent LaRue, who's Italian.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:10]** Yeah, Magwa.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:13]** It's not going to give him a lot of damage.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:16]** However... What does it do?

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:19]** The pharmacological inhibitor

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:26]** introduces a mild hallucinogen into a living creature, making it difficult for the target to move or act.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:34]** The target gains the encumbered condition and must succeed at a fortitude save or also gain the entangled condition.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:37]** This is a mind-affecting poison effect.


## Jon Swan

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:40]** This is a mind-affecting poison effect.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:47]** That's... Okay, so if they fail that, they can't take actions at all.


## Will Garrett

**[00:44:49 - 00:45:19]** whatever the so if they they gain the encumbered condition which I think is just it's not fun and then entangled is when they can't move yeah exactly so encumbered would just mean it's like slow movement or something yeah basically all of your speeds are reduced by 10 your maximum dex bonus to your AC is reduced to plus 2 and you take a negative 5 penalty to strength and dex base checks

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:46]** nice nice wow that is intense and then uh yeah uh entangled is no bueno whatsoever so you're saying that she gets hit in the neck doesn't seem to face her first she doesn't even notice it yeah and then she gets two points of damage okay two points of damage then gains the encumbered condition and must succeed at a fort save to not get the entangled condition correct


## Jon Swan

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:48]** Ah, I see.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:51]** I see what you're doing there.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** All right.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Quick question.


## Will Garrett

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:56]** I prefer non-lethal attacks.


## Jon Swan

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** I prefer them in general.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Here we go.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** Conditions.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** That's what I wanted.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** So she is encumbered.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** She's got to make that save.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** Boom.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:09]** So she's now encumbered on Hero Lab here.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** And let's see.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** Fortitude save.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** Come on.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** Special dive from Paizo.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** That is a 23.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:23]** Oh, you bet.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** Okay, I guess I'll give it to you.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:25]** Wow.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:26]** All right.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:29]** So you see it hit her.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:32]** You're maybe waiting for a sec to see her kind of start to react.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** But she does seem a little slower.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:36]** She seems like she takes a step.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** She's a little off balance.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:42]** Kind of stands up a little bit to right herself.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:44]** Try and make sure that everything's all right.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:57]** And at that moment, there's a shot that fires from behind you as Algiada Yome gets a crit on her azimuth laser pistol attack.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:02]** So that is another crit.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:09]** And that is going to be a good amount of damage here.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** All right, top of the round.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Round two.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** It is Magma's turn.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** And she's slowed.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:20]** And she's been hit by Algiata.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** She's been hit by Dr. OK.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:25]** Nico didn't do anything, right?

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:26]** And she's been hit.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:34]** She was almost hit by Rick in the sense of a distracting shot, but didn't seem to faze her.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** Here's hit her as well, just saying.


## Jon Swan

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:39]** Oh, yes, and Hears hit her with Magic Missile.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:39]** Thank you.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:41]** Sorry, that was, like, the first thing.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:54]** And I hate to say that you kind of did remind me, and she is definitely 100% going to turn and look at Hears and going to move towards Hears.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** Okay.

**[00:47:56 - 00:48:01]** You can tell as she kind of steps over, she turns like...

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:10]** And just like looks at you and takes a few steps forward and takes a swing at you with one of her knives.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:15]** But you can tell that she's slowed because of Dr. O'Keefe's inhibitor.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:19]** Let's see what she gets on her roll.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:22]** That is a 10 points.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:25]** I don't think that hits, does it?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:27]** Does that break your KAC?

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:33]** My KAC is 10, so... Oh, no, it's 18, actually.


## Jon Swan

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:38]** I thought it was really low, but instead it's really high.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** So it's fine.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:42]** It's okay.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** All right.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** So she takes a swing at you.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** It doesn't even get near you.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** It just swings in front of your face.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:51]** And you're not even phased.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** You don't feel like you need to even move.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:55]** She was nowhere near you.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** What is your response?

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:00]** It is your turn next.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:22]** so here's it's just gonna look like um right at her and be like it's time for you to cut it out and then cast days on her nice days days is a uh zero level skill this is a will save right dc 15 dc 15 will save

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** Yes.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** Will negates.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** Will negates.


## Jon Swan

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** Will negates.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** Will is trying to negate.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** We're doing a Will Save on Will Save the Podcast.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:34]** This might or might not be where we got the inspiration for this name.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:35]** Who knows?

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:38]** It's pretty high DC to beat.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** And you know what she got?

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** A 13.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:48]** You see her react for a moment, try and shake her head to clear what's going on.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** But then she just...

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:54]** zones out.

**[00:49:54 - 00:50:03]** as she is now, correct me if I'm wrong, unable to take actions, but has no penalty to AC.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** Correct.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:04]** Wow.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:05]** There you go.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** Stay right there.


## Jon Swan

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** Just stay right where you are.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:10]** Don't move.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:11]** All right.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:18]** It is the Kasathan up at the front of the ship's turn, and another shot rings out.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:23]** Immediately as you daze her, another shot rings out.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** and he completely misses.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:35]** As she kind of throws her head back to catch herself, the shot moves right where her head was and hits the blaster wall close to the older gentleman in the back.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:43]** He kind of looks and turns, just taken and shaken by the fact that all this combat is breaking out around him.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** Nico, what are you doing?


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:51]** So when the Kasathan came and swiped at Gears, he kind of...

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Yeah, Gears.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:55]** He kind of took it as kind of like an attack against him.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:58]** So just kind of like, swing it at me.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:06]** So at this point, Niko now is just like, okay, he reaches for two azimuth laser pistols and shoots.


## Jon Swan

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Shoots both of them?


## Kevin Decker

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Shoots both of them.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:11]** Wait, you're drawing two weapons?

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:11]** Isn't that a full turn?


## Jon Swan

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:16]** Yeah, so if you didn't have them drawn before, what's your base attack bonus?


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:21]** My base attack bonus?

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:24]** I need to take a closer look.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:27]** Attack bonus is plus zero.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** But my ranged attack is plus two.


## Jon Swan

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** That's fine.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:41]** So you can draw a weapon if you were moving and had a plus one attack bonus, you can draw at the same time, right?

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:44]** So what I'm hearing is you have nothing that lets you draw two weapons at the same time.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Well, so here's the thing.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:49]** Drawing or sheathing a weapon is a move action.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** I also have multi-weapon fighting.


## Jon Swan

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:53]** That gives you – OK.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:56]** So let's break down a quick rule thing here.

**[00:51:56 - 00:52:00]** Anyone can fire or use two weapons in each hand at any time.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:03]** If you do, you take a minus four to both.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:06]** I will say this, and I realize that I didn't say this before.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:13]** If you're trying to do non-lethal damage, you're going to take a minus four if it's with a weapon that typically deals lethal damage.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:17]** So think about that when you guys are doing it.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:17]** Sorry, say that again?


## Jon Swan

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** We can do non-lethal with ranged?

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** Drawing or sheathing a weapon is a move action.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:28]** So you get one standard, one move, and one swift action every round.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:33]** You can use your standard action to perform another move action.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:36]** So if you want to pull both of your pistols this turn, you could do that.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Or you could pull one and fire it.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** What do you want to do?

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:48]** So I think at this point, Niko's going to be like... She seems pretty out of it.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:51]** She got pretty dazed, literally, from here.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:56]** All right, so Niko is at this point, he's done with it.

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:01]** So he's going to pull both weapons, and he's going to be like, okay, this party's over.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:04]** And he's going to put both weapons right in this Kasathan's face.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:08]** And he's going to hold an action to attack with one of them.


## Jon Swan

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:14]** Okay, so holding an action might or might not... Oh, she moved here.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:19]** Holding an action... Would an intimidation actually do anything on this?

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Is she so out of it?


## Jon Swan

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:26]** She already seems out of it, so when you say that, she doesn't seem to even register it.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:31]** She kind of, like, her eyes look over towards you, but she seems like she, I mean, she can't take any action.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:35]** So she really seems like whatever Hears did has messed her up.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:37]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:42]** Special Agent LaRue clutches her womb.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:56]** And kind of pushes her hand up on the ground and reaches behind her to try and pull out what you guys can see as some sort of cuffs to use.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** There are two sets that she has.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:04]** And she stands up as her move action and takes a step towards Magwa.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:10]** You see the older man in the back just look confused.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** Hands against the wall.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:19]** Step back and just kind of slowly shrink down in the corner of the wall south of you here.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:22]** It is Rick's turn.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** What are you doing?

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** You've got people scared.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** You've got people shooting.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:32]** People all up in the face ready to restrain or do something.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** And the target can't do anything.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:37]** Rick is going to take two steps over.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** So he's got a clean line of sight.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** He's going to roll perception.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:43]** Okay.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:45]** On what?

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:48]** To see if there's any other threats around.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** Okay.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:49]** Okay.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:53]** So where is... Perception's a plus four.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:53]** Woo!


## Jon Swan

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:54]** That's pretty good.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:58]** So 16 for that.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:58]** 16.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:02]** You don't seem... This has all happened pretty quickly, right?

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:14]** It seems as if maybe... Not only do you notice that there's not much of a threat, but you kind of start putting the pieces together a little bit of what just happened in the past.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:16]** You know, each round is six seconds.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** We're on round two.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:19]** It hasn't even been 30 seconds yet.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:25]** And it seems like she was just waiting for the right moment to move forward and strike.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:29]** And when you think about it, you're like, oh, it was that person standing at the entrance.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:32]** As soon as they diverted somebody's attention, she moved.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:34]** And so far...

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:38]** You don't see any alarms or anything else happening.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:40]** She seems like the only threat in the area.


## Jon Swan

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** Exactly.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** Okay.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:53]** So then he's got his gun trained on her, and he's going to ready an action to shoot at her if she makes another attempt to attack anybody.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:54]** Okay.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:58]** And then he's going to say in his slow robotic voice, Stand down.

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** Nice.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:00]** Nice.


## Jon Swan

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:02]** Okay.


## Jon Swan

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** It is Dr.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:05]** O.K.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:07]** 's turn.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:09]** Things have slowed for just a moment.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** Mostly due to your inhibitor.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** What are you thinking?

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Uh, Kev, wait, hold on.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:15]** Kev, are you drinking Dr. Pepper?

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:15]** I am.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Are we allowed to say Dr. Pepper on air?

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:21]** Are you drinking Dr. Pepper and cream soda?

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** Wow.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** Oh.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** That sounds really good.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** I don't know if we can say it.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:28]** It tastes, you know, I mentioned cotton candy earlier.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:30]** It tastes like liquid cotton candy.


## Jon Swan

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** I like your style.


## Will Garrett

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** I like the way you think.


## Jon Swan

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:39]** All right, Doctor, okay, what are you doing?


## Will Garrett

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:43]** Um, so... Are you wrapping this up?

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:46]** This guy up here, he's shooting at us?


## Jon Swan

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:47]** No.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:52]** He appears to be shooting at us.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** The other Kasathan.


## Will Garrett

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:54]** Yeah.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** This guy.


## Kevin Decker

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:58]** He's just, like, shooting in the general direction because he hasn't hit a damn thing.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** Yeah, because he hasn't done anything.


## Will Garrett

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** Just making sure I shouldn't hit him.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:11]** Can I, like, get a sense of Agent LaRue's state with a life science check?

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:12]** Sure.


## Jon Swan

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:15]** Okay.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:18]** Actually, it probably, state, like, health-wise...


## Will Garrett

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:20]** Yes.


## Jon Swan

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:24]** Yeah, I think that would probably be a medicine check.


## Will Garrett

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:31]** Medicine check is slightly lower than my life science, unfortunately.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:34]** But still got a 22.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** 22.


## Jon Swan

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:46]** Yeah, I mean, you can tell... This could also probably be a perception check, but I'm going to say because of your skills and everything, that's fine.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:48]** I mean, you can tell that it...

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** She was shocked to get stabbed with a knife.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** 100%.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** But she's okay.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** She's not bleeding.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:58]** She's not bleeding too bad.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:02]** You think that if she just went untreated maybe in a few days.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** Is she suffering from the bleeding condition?

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:10]** She is not suffering mechanically from the bleeding condition.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** Gotcha.


## Will Garrett

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** Okay.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:18]** Then I'm going to...

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:23]** It's an action to draw a different weapon, correct?


## Jon Swan

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** Unless you have plus one and move at the same time.


## Will Garrett

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:29]** Okay, no, I can't do that.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:43]** So I'm just going to take a step back and then shoot him again, but this time I'm going to hit him with a minor inhibitor.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:47]** You're going to hit her with a minor inhibitor.


## Jon Swan

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:48]** What does that do?


## Will Garrett

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:57]** Takes a minus one penalty to attack rolls for six rounds.


## Jon Swan

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:25]** wow okay and is that the same where if you meet a certain uh if you meet no there's no dc or anything like it's just it's just if you beat her ac yeah if i if i hit okay against her kac right her kinetic ac yeah okay 16 16 to hit against her kinetic ac let's see did you beat it

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** Yes, you did.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** Just barely.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** Yeah.


## Will Garrett

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** So where do you hit?

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:36]** Um... Probably like the...

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** Is she facing me?


## Jon Swan

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:47]** She seems to be facing here, because that's where she last was when she was first encumbered by you and then now dazed.


## Will Garrett

**[00:59:47 - 01:00:00]** So I would say maybe one of her arms, in the mid-drift of her two arms on her right side, I'm just hitting her real quick with the minor inhibitor and I deal...

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** Four damage.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** Did a crit on damage.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** Four damage.


## Jon Swan

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** Max damage.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** Wow.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:06]** All right, yeah.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:17]** It hits her arm, and you can tell that whatever movement and sense of control she might have been struggling to recover, she totally loses it.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:25]** And her forearms just kind of fall, and she seems like she's about to just collapse onto the ground.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:27]** That's what it feels like.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:32]** You see the chief security officer, Algiada Yom.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:36]** Seems to run over.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:40]** And run past the figure at the entrance.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:43]** Runs out of her panel from before.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:46]** Runs down the steps as if she's running over.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** To make something happen.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:50]** It's the top of round two.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:53]** And... Or sorry, round three.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:58]** And it is what would be Magwa's turn.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:01]** But you see her just fall to her knees.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:02]** And...


## Jon Swan

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:07]** And almost blink her eyes, slowly trying to gain control.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:10]** All four of her arms are limp.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:16]** And she seems like she can't even move or do anything.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** It's Hears' turn.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:21]** What do you want to do?

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:25]** So I think Hears can see that Special Agent LaRue has the cuffs ready.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:26]** Yes.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:27]** Right.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:35]** And so just to help her out, he's going to try to, he has this summon ability.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:39]** It's called Unseen Servant and it can perform some actions for him.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:46]** I have to check with you, but I would like to... Because it can open doors and pick things up and stuff like that.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:46]** Hold chairs.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:53]** Maybe just kind of hold our attacker in place in some way.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:55]** Hold the hands back.


## Jon Swan

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** Like push her hands back.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:00]** I'll say that... Help secure her.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:01]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:02]** So...

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:06]** I think you'll definitely be able to move one of the hands back to move.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:15]** All four would be, I think a little bit much, but you can start to move one or two back to kind of help keep the hands whenever agent LaRue moves into place.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** Does that make sense?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:17]** Yeah.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:19]** Just to help prevent fighting back and secure.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:22]** Uh, that's what I, yeah, here's does that.


## Jon Swan

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** Okay, that's awesome.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** Yes.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:25]** That's really cool.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:29]** Yeah, so she is now encumbered, dazed, and then you're pushing her hands back.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:33]** You're trying to keep her up, make sure that she stays right where she is.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:36]** With my invisible friend, yeah.


## Jon Swan

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:37]** With your invisible friend.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:38]** What do you do when you cast it?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:49]** So, like, here's, like, insect palm just kind of opens up, and then this, like, sort of ephemeral, like, wind kind of comes out of it.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:58]** And then you just see, like, the sheer outline of something, like, kind of creepily move past, like... And, like, push her arms slowly.


## Jon Swan

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:59]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:03]** Almost in, like, a breeze, they kind of swing back as if they're being held there, yeah?

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** Just like that.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:09]** As you do that... Such a graceful pirate.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:13]** The figure standing at the entrance is... Everyone get back!

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:17]** Seems like we're starting to get this under control here.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:20]** Everyone please take a step back.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:21]** Nico, it's your turn.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:22]** What are you doing?


## Nicholas Belcher

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:30]** Nico continues to hold his blasters out in front of the dazed Kasathan's face.


## Will Garrett

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:31]** Okay.


## Nicholas Belcher

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:34]** Just ready to do anything, and he's just going to hold a full action.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:40]** If she does anything he doesn't like, he is very willing to just kind of lay her low.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:41]** Okay.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:42]** Nice.


## Jon Swan

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:47]** It's Special Agent LaRue's turn.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:52]** You see her step forward, stagger a little bit.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:54]** And start to take the cuffs.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:58]** And she applies... One set of cuffs.

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:00]** Thanks to... Here's his unseen servant.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:03]** She's able to... Pull two of the hands together.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:05]** And start to put one of the cuffs on.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:12]** And it seems like... It seems like... Magwa has kind of... Given up.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:16]** Her spirit seems to... Kind of surrender.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** A little bit.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:20]** We kind of... Take a moment...

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:26]** Special Agent LaRue is able to get another set of cuffs on.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:34]** The gentleman is still standing in the corner, still a little terrified, a little confused.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:38]** The figure walks over.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:42]** Algiada Yoms comes up and stands next to Hears.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:50]** The figure steps up and says, could we please take a step back and let this good woman do her work here?

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:51]** Please, please.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:56]** And starts to motion to you all to try and take a step back and says, I'm happy to take you on board.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:58]** I'm so sorry about this.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:00]** I'm so sorry.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** What do you all do?


## Nicholas Belcher

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:06]** Nico's going to put away his blasters and take a step back.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:08]** And he's going to move toward the ship.


## Kevin Decker

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** Rick holsters his weapon.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:17]** Hears walks past him towards the ship and says, You gotta get your platform under control.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:18]** Keeps let go.


## Jon Swan

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:23]** I'm so, so, so sorry about this.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:24]** I'm so sorry.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** Rick, Dr.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:26]** O.K., what are you doing?


## Will Garrett

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:31]** I'm going to talk to Special Agent LaRue and ask if she's okay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:31]** Okay.


## Will Garrett

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:37]** What do you say?

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:41]** Special Agent LaRue, do you require any medical assistance?


## Jon Swan

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** I think I'll...

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:47]** I'll be all right.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:51]** I was both expecting and not expecting that.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:56]** I think you can understand that us stewards are ready for anything.

**[01:05:56 - 01:06:00]** And she kind of pats Magwa's shoulder, and Magwa's still a little dazed.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:04]** How long do your inhibitors last, and how long does days last?

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:05]** Six rounds.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:06]** Six rounds.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:08]** And how long does days last, Kiers?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:12]** Days last, I think, for one turn.


## Jon Swan

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:13]** One turn?

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:14]** Oh, really?


## Speaker_0

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:14]** Yeah.


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:19]** Um, one, oh, um, it's immune.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:21]** It's actually, it's immune to it for one minute.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:22]** The duration.


## Jon Swan

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:23]** Yeah.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:24]** What's the duration?


## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:26]** Where is that?

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:26]** I'm sorry.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:29]** One round, one round, one round.


## Jon Swan

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:30]** Okay.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:30]** Yeah.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:38]** So she kind of, she, she seems to snap out of it a little bit and just shakes her head.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:47]** And Special Agent LaRue turns to Dr. O'Kay and just says, I think we'll be all right.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:51]** Probably best that I handle it from this point.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:54]** You can continue on your way.

**[01:06:54 - 01:07:00]** And she kind of holds her wound and kind of gestures for you to get on the ship.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:02]** I'll deal with the authorities here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:04]** Very well.

## Kelly Gilliam

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:24]** Here's mandibles, like, just sort of jittering glee.


## Jon Swan

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:02]** My perception was an 8.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:07]** Just to see, like, just to try to understand what's happening between everything.


## Jon Swan

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:12]** So, Special Agent LaRue has handcuffed Magwa.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:14]** Special Agent LaRue is standing there.

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:16]** She's, uh...

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:21]** She seems to be trying to reach for her comm device while steadying Magwa.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:28]** Magwa seems to just kind of slump down onto her legs now and sitting kind of crisscross applesauce on the floor there.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:32]** Special Agent LaRue holding her wounds but also starts to pull out a comm device.

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:40]** Algiata Iom walks up and starts to talk, kind of converse, maybe debrief a little bit with Special Agent LaRue.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:45]** The individual at the top of the stairs, the Kasathan...

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:19]** He's kind of talking to you, Rick.


## Kevin Decker

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:23]** I guess as everybody else starts moving onto the ship, then Rick will turn and follow.


## Jon Swan

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:25]** Okay.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:39]** So Captain Rameem steps forward and just kind of says, Well, again, I'm so sorry about this, but please, please, let's let them do their job and welcome aboard the Chimera.
