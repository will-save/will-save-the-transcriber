**[00:00:44 - 00:00:45]** What does any of this mean?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on We'll See.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:46]** What a week it has been after last week's episode.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:51]** And I really want to get into this episode and our playing.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:58]** But I first want to talk about secret talents that we all have.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:06]** And if there's anything in particular that anyone would like to share, please.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:07]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** Anyone like Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** Anyone who's named Kevin.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** I have exceptionally good handwriting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** Or Will.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:15]** Okay, Will shared that he has exceptionally good handwriting.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** I've been told.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:22]** I'm looking at a note that he wrote right now, and I can confirm that is mostly true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Mostly true?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** No, he's a very good handwriter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** That's good.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** Nick, Kelly, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:31]** But that pales in comparison to some of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:34]** To some of us who are superheroes in their own right.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** Heroes and pillars of the community.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** Yeah, like a neighborhood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:41]** Or degenerates that just haven't been caught yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** I don't like where this is going at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** Tell us, Kevin.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Tell us.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** Regale us, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** I don't even know how we brought that up.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:53]** Somebody was like, oh, because I was wiggling my fingers in front of the screen.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:53]** Yes.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:56]** Yeah, anyways.

**[00:02:56 - 00:03:01]** I guess one of my secret talents is shadow puppets.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:01]** Oh!

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:03]** I am fairly good.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** I'm not going to say I'm the best.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** I can't do magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:10]** But like 2006, 2007, back-to-back champ?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** Well, I was like U.S.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:15]** national, not global.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** Right, yeah, yeah.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:19]** Didn't make the Olympics team, but certainly national level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:24]** He was definitely the best puppet master on his submarine.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** What's your origin story, Kev?

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:33]** So I guess the way I knew that I learned that I was such a good shadow puppet master, shadow master.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** Yeah.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** Shadow master.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** Master of the shadows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:40]** The power went out in my neighborhood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:42]** That should be your gamer tag, like shadow masters.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:45]** Shadow puppets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** Sounds amazing.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:46]** Yeah.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:50]** No, the power went out of my neighborhood one time and like the whole neighborhood went dark.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:54]** And so my family and I, this is like right after sundown or whatever.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:57]** So my family and I were sitting in the living room and we were bored.

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** So we had a lantern and we had the blinds closed.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:03]** So I was doing shadow puppets onto the curtain.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:07]** And I just did my regular routine.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:12]** I have a dog and a rabbit and I can do a gorilla and an elephant.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:17]** And then I started telling stories and I had the dog chasing the rabbit and some other stuff.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:21]** And I was doing all this show work and then the lights came back on.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:25]** And so my family stepped outside to make sure the neighborhood came back on.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:28]** And apparently the entire neighborhood had been watching my shadow show.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** That is awesome.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:36]** So yes, apparently I'm, I'm at least popular in my old neighborhood for my shadow puppet abilities.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:36]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:40]** When you show up, are they like, hey, that's Shadow Master.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:41]** That's Shadow Master.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:42]** Hey, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** The puppet master.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** Hey, Shadow Master.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:53]** You go to the local high school football game on Friday night, and they give you a touchdown from the stands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** They project it onto the big screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** Local celebrity Shadow Master.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:59]** Yeah, that's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** The bat and the bird and the butterfly.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:04]** You got that thing that... I actually get really frustrated with, like, TV shows that do it.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:12]** So, like, we were watching American Housewife, and on one of the episodes at the end of it, there's one of the characters is doing shadow puppets.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:19]** But it's, like, they show the hands, and then they show the shadow puppet, and it's clearly not, like, an actual shadow puppet.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:21]** It's, like, digital.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** Lame.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:22]** What?

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** You guys can't even pretend that, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:46]** anyways they can't even they can't even hire a good puppet master yeah like me they should just call me up and that's right you should consult for them you should be like yeah obviously you should be a prop master who does just shadow puppets yeah or an actual or actual prop master


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:49]** I was on a set because I used to do background acting, for those who don't know.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:52]** And I was on a set of a military movie.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** I don't even remember the name of it now.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** It's like Indisposable or something.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** I forget.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** The Dispensable?

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:03]** It was like a small-time independent film.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:07]** But it was all military-based, and they had a guy there that was their military expert.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:10]** But I was looking at all their uniforms, and nobody had their uniforms right.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:13]** And I'd just gotten out of the Navy, so I was like...

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:17]** I went to the prop master and was like, hey, I'm just letting you know the belts are all wrong.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:23]** If you do it this way, not only can you make sure they're all right, but it also makes it easier to take it on and off.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:30]** And some other small facts about how a military person actually does it with these uniforms.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:33]** And she was like, oh, yeah, thanks, and ignored me.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** And I was like, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** Wow.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:35]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:39]** Years of experience gone.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:41]** Just make a shadow puppet with a dinosaur eating her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:46]** We'll have to do a shadow puppet showing them putting on a belt properly.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:48]** Nobody knows how to put on a belt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:51]** That's how you do all of your presentations for work and everything now.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** It's hard digitally though.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** It's really hard.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** I don't know how you do it over Zoom.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:58]** It's really tough.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** Kevin is really talented, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** He's also a good artist and stuff.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:02]** He's a great artist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:08]** My PowerPoint drawing skills are actually, I think, pretty damn good.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:10]** I'm just going to... John would know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:14]** You should push him up for hire on Etsy.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** Yeah, on Fiverr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** I'll draw your diagrams in PowerPoint and shadow puppets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:21]** Yeah.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** We'll save the podcast.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** Side hustle.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:30]** Hire us on Fiverr for all your PowerPoint presentations.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:33]** If you like what you hear.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:34]** Alright, let's get down to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:37]** Let's get down to business.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** To your feet.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:42]** The Huns?

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:44]** To your feet.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** To your feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:52]** Okay, so I think last time there was a lot of

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:55]** discovery of stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:58]** You know, like an ice cannon shooting me in the chest.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** Like, yeah, that's discovery.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** Yeah, it's a lot of discovery.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:04]** I want to go over all the discovery.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:10]** So let's just let's do a little highlight reel.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:25]** There was Dr. Okay and Rick overhearing a conversation between Algiata, the Rhyphorian chief security officer, and Trostenec, a Vesk bounty hunter, regarding some plan.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:33]** There was Professor Brodent Benjam asking you to check on the disappearance of Algiata.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:38]** And then he also mentions being worried about some sort of relic missing.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** Odd.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:49]** While checking out Trostenec's room, you find a gift wrapped package, right?

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:52]** As well as, I believe, a note.

**[00:08:53 - 00:09:00]** And I think you read the note and it seemed to be from Trostenec's wifey, right?

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:06]** Then, another big thing, you go into Algiada's room.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:11]** It is trapped with an ice carbine that hits Nico in the chest.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:14]** You find a couple things.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:28]** You find a paper account ledger with some transfers to known packed world and near-space banks, but also a conspicuous line that says 4LP Ship Repairs.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:43]** You find a data pad, right, wherein there's like some coded communication thread that indicates that upon returning to the Pact Worlds, so when you get back, Captain Rameem could be in some trouble.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:49]** And it seems Algiada was maybe willing to give up Captain Rameem.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:55]** Maybe some sort of information in exchange for what could likely be the Chimera.

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:06]** And then finally, as you're resting for 10 minutes in Algiada's room, you notice a picture of an archaeological dig site with two people in the frame.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:13]** One is a young man who looks a great deal like Algiada.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:20]** And the other is a younger, clean-shaven Professor Brodent Benjam.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:27]** Now, there are other clues and events and pieces of, like, information that have occurred.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:29]** There's, like, there's Grath, who you talked to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** That we've all missed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** What?

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** Yeah, that was all missed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:34]** There's other information that these guys just missed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** No, no, no.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:39]** Things that happened, like talking about Grath when you all first talked to him.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:42]** I think he was talking about losing some stuff.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:50]** Lozu standing still, the first mate, just standing stone cold still in the hallway.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:55]** Also, this Star Dream 2 emblazoned on the panel.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:56]** But...

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** If you want to bring those up, that's fine.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:01]** But I just figured we'd start with these.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:06]** What are your characters thinking with all these clues?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:07]** All right.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:11]** So Rick is trying to piece this all together.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:15]** Again, this is a very strange situation for anybody.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:23]** Picture that you get onto a cruise ship and then like the cruise ship stops and there's all this chaos going on.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:29]** And the passengers, there's four passengers that link up together and are like, hey guys, let's work together to figure out what's going on.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:30]** That's where we are.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:39]** And Rick is cautious of, not only is he cautious of all the stuff going on on the ship, but the three people that he's associated with closely.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:43]** Especially the weird slime doctor.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:44]** Yeah.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:49]** But that got Will's attention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** Yeah, Will looked up at that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:57]** So we have Lozu and Keeve are definitely in some kind of romantic relationship.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:58]** Yes, yes.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:11]** We know that Algiada might be double-crossing her own ship because she's associated with Troskenec, and he's got some kind of plan that she thinks he shouldn't go through with.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:23]** And now it's coming out that this letter or this data pad has this weird stuff about Uncle R, which we deduced that it is actually the captain.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:27]** So here's what Rick thinks.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:42]** is that Algiana and Trostendak were going to take over this ship and kill off the captain for whatever the situation was that whatever deal they made with whoever, except now that this professor's on board,

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:48]** Algiada's got second thoughts because the professor's connection to her father.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** So that's where Rick stands with this.

**[00:12:52 - 00:13:00]** Also, I still don't know where Lozu and Keeve come in because Trostnik pointed out Keeve as being some kind of bad, bad character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:06]** Kev, can I just say what was most impressive about that whole thing was that you did it all in shadow puppets.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:09]** And although shadow puppets are not a good form...

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** It's bad for podcasts, but I knew exactly what you were saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:15]** That was really impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:18]** If you look on YouTube later, we'll have the shadow puppet up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:25]** So, I knew immediately who you were talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** I'm sorry, I'm just really good at Vesks.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** What about anybody else?

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** Any thoughts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:34]** Well, if it wasn't personal for Nico before, it is now.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:35]** Why?

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** It is now.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:40]** Well, Nico before was just, he was going to try to play the situation to his advantage.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** He was curious.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** Now he just got shot in the chest.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:51]** Nico, while he's starting to fit the pieces together, the gloves are off, and Nico's thinking, someone's going to die.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** Someone is going to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:56]** Wow.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:56]** Dang.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:57]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** Like, Nico's going to kill someone?

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** You were calling Rick a murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** Yeah.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:07]** Nico was so nice to Lozu, and now Nico's like, I don't know.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:09]** I think I'm just going to mess with people up.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** I got shot in the chest.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** I got shot in the chest.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:12]** By who?

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** By who?

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:14]** By Lozu's trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** By someone's trap.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** By someone's trap.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:18]** Someone's trap.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** Lozu asks us to go into this room.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** So that's why someone's going to die.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:25]** I don't know who it is, nor does Nico doesn't know who it is.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** But when Nico finds out, someone's expendable.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** And someone's going to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** Someone is expendable.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:39]** Any other thoughts before we head on back to our old haunt, the Chimera?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** I mean, Dr. Okay is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:43 - 00:15:08]** mostly wants just answers like more than he wants people dead which you know he's kind of indifferent about but uh yes i'd like to get to the bottom of this yeah here's feels the same pretty much he really is interested in that relic kind of wants to just get around all this by kind of taking control of the whole situation on board

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:11]** If that means taking over the ship, then so be it.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** We'll see what the team decides.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:20]** And honestly, the Lozu thing was the creepiest, so I think that's what he's most interested in in terms of the mysteries of the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:22]** That was pretty creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:26]** Here's also, his interest was piqued when we joked about taking over the ship.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Yeah, really piqued.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** Because his pirate instincts were like, yeah, let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** Yeah, that's the only way.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** Violence is always the answer.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** Strategic violence.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:35]** Murder, murder, murder, murder.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:37]** Well, I think it's time.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:53]** If I recall, you all went into Algiata's room and you are resting there for 10 minutes so Nico can get his stamina points back.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:56]** And it was at that time that... Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** I said booyah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** Booyah, yes.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:00]** Booyah, as the kids say.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** I don't appreciate you calling me a kid, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** That's what's hip, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** Yeah, what's going on, fellow kids?

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** Saying memes on a podcast is a killer.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Everyone loves it.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:20]** So, you look over and you see this photo.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:25]** Somehow, maybe it just... You just didn't really look when you were in here before.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:28]** You just didn't take a close look, but you do this time.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** What are you all thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:36]** This is a photo of Algiata's presumed

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:37]** Father?

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** Somebody who has a semblance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** Presumed, yeah.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:47]** So it's a young professor with a male... What is she called?

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** I forget.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:48]** Rhyphorian?

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** Rhododendron?

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:52]** Rhododendron?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** Rhyphorian?

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** Yeah.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:56]** Yeah.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** Sorry, I missed that.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** So you're thinking...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:22]** what are you guys thinking nico here's nico is just getting up from resting a little bit and he's just plain and simple he's taking two pistols out he's just like all right i'm ready let's do this um do what exactly take over the ship i think that's what nico had in mind yep yeah exactly

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:27]** We were just about to, as he remembers, also consider doing that.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:29]** So here's this kind of I and Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:33]** I believe the discussion was we were going to head to the bridge just to check on everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:38]** And then we'll decide what we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:43]** I do not wish to be arrested upon arriving at Absalom.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:52]** However, I do find it pertinent that we get to the bottom of this, or perhaps we might not make it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:54 - 00:18:02]** It's either we get arrested here or we die upon arrival or prior to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:07]** Let's just take a measure of caution, shall we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** That is a concern of mine.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:13]** The note said, upon the Chimera's return to the Pact Worlds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:15]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** It's around this time.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** Yeah, go ahead, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:23]** We're going to have to, one way or another, we're going to end up being taken control of the ship.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** I'd rather it be sooner than later.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:30]** That way we can disrupt whoever our mysterious adjutant is.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** And Nico points to his chest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:34]** I will say this, though.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** We cannot take this ship alone.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:41]** We will have to have people on our side.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:49]** And so perhaps firing first and sorting out what happens later might not be the best strategy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:52]** Nico's going to look at Dr. Okay with a cocky expression.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:55]** He's just going to say, you just haven't seen how good of a shot I am yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:56 - 00:19:00]** That's not what I was saying, but okay.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:02]** You want to run the ship by yourself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** Go right ahead.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:08]** Nico's going to respond back just like, look, someone shot me.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:10]** That doesn't happen.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** Someone is going to die.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:16]** And rest assured, someone is going to be in pain before they die.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:23]** I have a reputation upholding that reputation is one of excellence and one of do not cross me.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:24]** Violence.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** I like your style.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:36]** So we have two party members who think violence is the answer and two party members who are like, maybe Nico winks over at a here's Dr. Okay.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:43]** You feel a little on your data pad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:45]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Okay.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** I'll look at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** Can I roll a perception to see if I noticed that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** Sure.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** I'll roll perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:59]** I got a 19 plus 4.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** So I got a 23 on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** Okay.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:02]** Nice.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:04]** My perception was a straight up 18.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:06]** 18 as well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** Do I get to roll against it?

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** Are you trying to hide it?

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:11]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:16]** Do I not hide it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:18]** I don't know either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:22]** Your cell phone just went... Real loud.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:25]** We all just turn and see you pull your phone up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:27]** More Tinder matches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:33]** Would you look on the tentacles of that one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** Wow.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:38]** There's a notification.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:40]** So I can look at the notification.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:44]** Yeah, there's a notification that's been pushed to your data pad that the motion sensor outside is going off.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:46]** Oh!

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** It goes off.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** There's one that comes in.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** The first one comes in.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** It's like it was tripped.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:59]** And then another one comes in that it was tripped and now is staying there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:02]** There's someone outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:15]** Nico Nico is going to look at everybody quietly and he's going to with his pistol kind of like nudge and indicate to everybody to take hiding places around the door and to wait, wait and ambush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:21]** Are we storming the hallway or are we waiting for them to come in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:24]** So Nico walks and... When they come in.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** Nico goes to hide.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** What do the rest of you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:31]** Can I see the map, Mr. Game Master?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:32]** Yes.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** Why, of course.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** Why, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:38]** I rolled an 18 on my perception.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** I get to see the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:42]** I was going to say, you do successfully see the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** Well then.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** Well, all right.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:52]** Hears takes cover with his new gun and points it at the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:55]** Rick is going to walk up to the door and look through the eye hole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:59]** There's no... What do you mean there's no eye hole?

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** Because it's a door that separates like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:06]** There's no screen for the eye hole?

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** No, because it's a private room.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** It's a private room, no.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:10]** Yeah, why would it not have an eye?

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:12]** Yeah, that's ridiculous, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:17]** Are you challenging me on whether they're eye holes?

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:17]** Yeah.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:18]** Is this a challenge?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Yeah, this is a challenge.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:30]** I'm just saying, like, even the most high-tech hotels would have some kind of way to look out or, like, see directly in front of the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:33]** Do you want to roll off to see if it has an eye hole or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** Yeah, yeah, I'll do that.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** What do I roll?

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Do I get a bonus or is this 20-20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** We're just doing D20s.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** Let's just see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:41]** Roll off.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** I got an 8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** Ooh, I got a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:46]** Yes!

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:50]** Oh, my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:52]** An eye hole appears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:53 - 00:23:00]** I'll give you that there's no eye hole, but there is a screen that Rick can hold down the button and see, like a camera that points directly out from the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:02]** You can't see.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** You look out and... Like a ring.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Can I say that?

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:05]** Like a ring.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** This is what you see.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:07]** Trademark.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** You see...

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:16]** Mostly somebody short is standing.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:23]** It looks like it's probably a Yosuke standing, not facing the door, looking down the hallway.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** Rat guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:30]** Rat guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:30]** Let's return.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:33]** Do I need to roll anything for this?

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:35]** The only Yosuke we know on board is Grath?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Do I see a tail?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** It's likely Grath, is what I'll say.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:43]** You don't need to roll.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:47]** You as Rick are like, there's only one Yosuke that I know on board.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:51]** Yeah, but Keeve is also a rodent-like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:55]** No, Keeve is a Marakoi, which are tall creatures.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** Tall, short.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:57]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:05]** So Rick will pull his gun, his pistol, and then open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:14]** And when the door opens, you see before you... Grath.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:18]** Standing probably... I put him a little ahead.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:23]** Standing closer in front of the door, looking down at his data pad.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:25]** Has some headphones in.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:27]** Turns.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:28]** Sees you.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** And look a surprise on his face.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** Hey!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:35]** Is everything okay?

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** Good evening.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:42]** Nico at that point is going to ask Rick, he's going to be, is that our friend out there?

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:42]** Is that graph?

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:44]** It is.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:49]** Is that, uh, is that, that, uh, that Nico guy graph get in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:51 - 00:25:01]** Rick will step back and like usher him in as he puts his gun in the back of his holster graph, like takes out his headphones and he, and he just steps up to the front of the door.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** And he looks in.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:08]** Is this the thing that Lose you asked you to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:10]** Don't play stupid.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** Get in here.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** All the way in.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** I'm not playing games right now.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:16]** And he takes one of his pistols and he points at his chest.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** Shots have been fired.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** I'm not playing around.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Get in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** He doesn't do that.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:28]** Instead, he just stands and looks at you and says, I was getting ready to go to the gym, and now you're pointing a gun at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:30]** Is this really what you want to do right now?

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:32]** Nico's going to do an intimidation check.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:34]** He's like, I'm not playing around.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:34]** One more time.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** Get in here.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** Kidding me.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:52]** rick's gonna step in front of nico and and i'm gonna shoot nico with a tranquilizer all right so rick steps in front and rick are you doing that's a 19 in total that's a 12 on the roll seven on the plus and and rick what are you doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:52 - 00:26:07]** I kind of put my hand back towards Nico as in like a calm down, and I get close to Grath and tell him like, I'm sorry to bother you, Grath, but we do think that there is something important to talk about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** All right, look.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:14]** I know that Lozu asked you to go looking for stuff without Giada.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:19]** I was going to the gym, but I'm curious to find out.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:25]** And I'll talk, but only if you keep your dog on a leash there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** Dog?

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** Look who's talking.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:31]** I might have Hearser over there call you Ratboy a couple more times.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** Wait, Rat Guy's here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:36]** Oh, wow.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:43]** Question for Will was, we all knew about the tail ring?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** Well, I'm going to bring it up with him anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:53]** Okay, so I'll step out into the hall.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** Why don't we do that?

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Hold on, hold on, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:59]** Look, you know what we could all use, it sounds like?

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** A drink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** Is this Grath talking or John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** This is Grath.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** Oh, okay.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:07]** So, why don't I just go grab a drink?

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:10]** You guys are welcome to come into my room.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** We can have a drink.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Or I can bring the drinks back over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:16]** Grath, I think that sounds like an excellent idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:16]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:19]** Maybe Nico should stay behind, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:22]** You know, Nico, I don't know what your problem is today.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:26]** I don't know why you woke up on the wrong side of the bed, but...

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:28]** We had a good time last time.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:28]** We did.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:31]** I hope that we can just have a good time this time.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:35]** And I'm sorry about what happened to you, but why don't we just have a drink and we can all talk about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:47]** Graf, we did have a good time last night, but to be honest, our friendship here is a little suspect at the moment due to your lack of empathy at the bolt that's in my chest right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:49]** Nobody can see that you got shot, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** Yeah, you can.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:54]** You can definitely see that there was a burn.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:56]** But I will say this.

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:01]** You entered into the conversation with like a super threat.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:05]** So Graf is not going to be super empathetic at the moment.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:08]** And he literally just said, I'm sorry for what's going on.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** Not everyone's guilty.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** Look, guys, let me just go get the drink.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** You can come with me if you're worried.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:21]** And he like looks at Nico if you're worried and then walks over to his room, which is right across the hall.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** Not everyone's guilty, man.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** Does anyone follow or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:32]** Before Rick walks out the room, he reaches back and grabs that picture of Algiana's potential father.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:32]** Okay.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** Is that the right way of saying it?

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** And then he's going to follow Grath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** Okay.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:41]** So Grath walks over and opens the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:43]** Is that Grath's room right across the hall?

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** Yeah.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:44]** That makes a lot of sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:46]** Good job, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:50]** Way to... So he walks over and he walks in.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** Rick, you're the only person who's coming with?

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:54]** Apparently.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:56]** I'm going for sure.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** We'll all go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** Rick pauses at the door and says, like, may I enter?

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:01]** Yeah.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:02]** Come on in.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** Come on in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:08]** Niko's gonna look over right here and he's gonna say, if Ratboy's giving us the drinks, watch what he puts in them.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:11]** Oh my God.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:13]** It's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:17]** So you all walk over.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:20]** I'm going to slip something into Nico's throat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:22]** By the way, you guys can't hear that.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** He just whispered that into here's his ear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:25]** Roll perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** You need to.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:31]** I need Dr. OK and Rick to roll perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** 17 on perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** What about deception for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:34]** 19.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** 19.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** Give me a deception check, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:41]** I just want to make sure I see my deception modifier.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:42]** Is there a deception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:45]** I see there's a bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:47]** I would say disguise.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:48]** Not disguise.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** Disguise is like a physical disguise.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Yeah, I'd say bluff.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** Okay.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** A hand is like a physical thing.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:59]** That's a 21, 15 plus six.

**[00:29:59 - 00:29:59]** All right.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** You guys don't hear it.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** Only hears it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:06]** But I heard the shit that he said earlier, so I'm still going to drug him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** Okay.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** Well, let's get to it.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:08]** Let's get to it.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:09]** You walk in.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:13]** His room, kind of messy, a little bright.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:43]** pretty nice there's no desk in fact there's a still uh where he's clearly been making his own alcohol and he walks over he there's like a little shelf next to it and there's some uh some like really cool odd looking glasses that have like like a spout and you can like drink out of it and uh and so he walks over and he sees oh all of you coming in all right uh so five we're doing five are we all drinking five shots five is an appropriate count yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:47]** Does this contain any salt?

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** It does not have any salt.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:51]** Pour me one, sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** You are welcome to pour your own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** Nico accepts a glass, pours his own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:01]** Yeah, so he hands you the glass, and as he does, he says, you guys like these glasses?

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** Pretty cool, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** They are quite interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** Where did you obtain them?

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:13]** Well, my kid sister actually made them.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** Yeah.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:14]** Yeah.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:14]** Yeah.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** She actually made it.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:16]** Well, she did here.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:19]** And then, and then he like kind of excited.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:24]** He like pulls out his little thing and he starts to like show you pictures of his kid sister.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:30]** And it looks, it's like her, you know, in different, there's like one or two lingerie.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** That's weird.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:31]** Wow.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** Okay.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** All right.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:57]** this podcast is not going in that direction uh wow okay so he shows you the pictures and it's like her you know she's like on the street and then there's like one of her making the glasses and when he pulls out the one the picture of her like on the street you know it's like he like zoomed into a picture of her with some friends they're all standing in the city somewhere in the daytime and um

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:11]** Rick, you see the picture and you see the background and something in you just like, it like rings a really distant bell.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:14]** It feels weirdly familiar.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:18]** It's like when you smell something you haven't smelled for a long time and it's tied to some memory.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:21]** But like you can't follow the rabbit hole down.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** You can't like remember everything.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** It's really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:27]** Is there something I can roll to get more from that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:33]** You could do a wisdom check to try and see if you can remember more, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** You think?

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:38]** Wisdom, I have a plus zero, so this is going nowhere.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:43]** I got three, so it flashes and then it fades away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:52]** Yeah, it fades away, and I don't think anybody else caught the expression on your face, if there was any.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:55]** Nico's got a little perception on that.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** I got a 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:05]** Yeah, he's an android, so nothing.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:09]** And you didn't really even know what to look for, because there wasn't anything going on, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:21]** No, there wasn't anything going on, but Nico wanted to just... He's a master judge of character, so he was just hoping that something... Can I ask, is it something to do... Is his sister familiar, or is it just the background?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** The background.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:25]** Maybe it was something in the background.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:29]** You can't really be sure, but you're like, huh, okay.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** I feel like... Huh.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** Yeah.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Weird.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:40]** It's literally like you smell something, and you're like, why do I know that smell?

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:46]** It's a bit nostalgic in a way, and you're just not quite sure why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:56]** Rick's head hurts just a little bit about this, and so he just kind of asks Grath, may I ask where your sister lives?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** Well...

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:04]** I mean, I'll just tell you, we're all friends here, right, Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:11]** Nico's like, no, no, no.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:14]** Nico's saying, I'm like, I'll calm down after I add this drink.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:19]** You can understand, Graf, you'd probably be pretty jumpy and trigger finger-ish, too, if you'd just been shot.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** So give me a break.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** Well.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:21]** Give me a break.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** We had a good time last night.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:25]** I'm going to need some alcohol before I have a good time again.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:29]** So he says, well, she doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** I'm from Akitan.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** And, uh...

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:42]** My sister, unfortunately, doesn't live there anymore because she doesn't live anywhere anymore.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:44]** I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:47]** I am so sorry to hear that, Grath.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:49]** I did not mean to... It's okay.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:49]** It's okay.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** It's all right.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:52]** That's as close as Rick gets to empathy.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** Okay.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** His emotions are... Yeah, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** No, it's good.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** It's fine.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:56]** You asked.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** I'm going to talk about it.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:58]** It's fine.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** It's all good.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:04]** Anyway, so...

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** I was going to ask, walks over, sits on the bed.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:10]** If I may pry a little bit.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:16]** So didn't Lozu put you all up to searching around?

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** And if you don't mind me asking, did you find anything?

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:24]** It looks like there was some trouble here with Nico and the gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:29]** Just to be clear, he knows that Alciata is missing, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:29]** Yeah.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:35]** Can you tell us anything about the activity around Algiada's room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** Activity around Algiada?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** Have you noticed anything strange?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:42]** Have you... When was the last time you saw Algiada?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:51]** The last time I saw Algiada... I guess it was... Yesterday.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Went to the bridge.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:57]** Yeah, I saw her leaving.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** Haven't, uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** I haven't really seen her since then.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** Have you seen anyone else go into that room?

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** No.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** Possibly Lozu?

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:10]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** No, I didn't see Lozu go into that room.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:18]** Lozu, I think, was busy doing something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:20]** Zero sense motive, but I'm going to try it.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** Yeah, same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** Yeah, Nico rolled a sense motive as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:24]** Which I'll get.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** Wow, three.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:27]** Three?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** Oh, I can't even do sense motive.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** Oh, I can't do sense motive.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** I have a minus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:33]** That's a 15 for Nico, 9 plus 6.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:36]** Rick believes everything that McGrath is saying.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** That's not a 15.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:39]** That's a 13, 9 plus 4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** Dr. Oka?

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:41]** Uh, 15.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** 15.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Yeah.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:53]** He seems like, he seems very honest in saying that when you suggest that Lozu was somebody that went in there, he's kind of like, really?

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** Like, Lozu is the person that you think went in there?

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:59]** Like, you clearly don't know Lozu.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** Like, she would not go in there.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:04]** It's kind of the tone of voice that he kind of says with it.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:08]** So he, he, he basically says definitely not Lowe's.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** She didn't go in there.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:19]** Uh, I think there was some point where I thought I saw, uh, whatever the, the vest passenger is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:21]** They just connect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** Yeah.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:28]** They, they went into, uh, they, they talked to the captain, heard him talking about some thrusters.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** They're talking in the room.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** That was it.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:33]** Um, but I haven't seen anybody go into Algiata's room.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** Um,

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:35]** Yeah.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:39]** Lozu is, she's funny.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:45]** She hasn't had an easy go of it, you know.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:52]** I'm sure one day she'll be more confident, but I don't know if you can tell, but she's a little less than confident.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:59]** What can you tell us of her connection to Keeve, the mechanic in the engine room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** You know, it's funny.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:13]** I think there could be something going on with her and them, but... Okay, so she did seem concerned about him.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:17]** He, last night, I think got some... I don't know.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:19]** We've had drinks before.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** Sorry, they, last night.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** There's something going on with them.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:26]** Because, you know, we've had drinks before, but they...

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:32]** They came by and just asked for just a whole bottle.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:35]** And then I think they drank a lot of it.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:38]** So I think Lozu was probably a little worried about that.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:43]** So that's as far as I know.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** So maybe a little more than friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:52]** I believe now would be a good time to inform you that we were asked to go to Algiada's room on behalf of Lozu.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:53]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:56]** And when we opened the door, there was a trap set.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** That is why Nico is so upset.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:02]** I got shot, and he says it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:06]** So you can see our predicament.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:09]** The issue now is who set that trap and why.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** I do not know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** What can you tell us about Algiada?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:15]** Algiada is a...

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** She's interesting.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** You know, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** Regale us, please.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** Oh, let me regale you.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:25]** While I enjoy this fine, fine spirit of yours.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** It's good moonshine, right?

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:26]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** It's good moonshine.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** Yeah.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:28]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:28]** It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** I made it myself.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:30]** Sorry.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:33]** Look, I think maybe I mentioned it last night.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:34]** I don't know.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** Let's start with this.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:37]** Her and I had a falling out.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:37]** Okay.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** Because you know what she did?

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:40]** She took my tail ring.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:52]** She took it when we were sparring in the gym right out from under my nose, and my grandfather gave me that ring, and it's from a long line of the Morrow-Akitan families.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:54]** And so she denied it, but I can't trust her.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** And she's got some, like, side business with the cat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Don't mean to interrupt you.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** No, no, it's a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** Wait, what about side business?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** I was... Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** Nico wants to know about the side business, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** He's going to be like, what side business?

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:11]** We got a couple of people talking right now.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** So let's start with Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:24]** I was just going to say and interrupt you, Gareth, but I was in the gym earlier where I found a ring.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** Would it be this?

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:31]** Can I, like, show him the ring with diplomacy or something?

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** Well, hot damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:57]** yeah make it a pomacy check so you said that algiata took the ring from him 14 yeah well hot damn that's my i guess maybe it fell off maybe she didn't take it i don't know she's uh she doesn't have the best relationship with people here on the ship she can be a little unfriendly

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** Um, but I guess you didn't take my ring.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** So does Nico remember?

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** I'll just apologize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:09]** Does Nico remember, uh, that does Nico remember or, or did he see when he was looking in there, Dr. Okay.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** Picking up the, uh, the tail ring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** I don't know.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:15]** I think it was just Dr. Okay.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:15]** It was in there.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** I think Nico, you were outside, right?

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:24]** We were all outside, which is why I want to know, like, do, would Nico know that he had the tail ring prior?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** Oh, man.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:28]** Nico is so suspicious of everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** I think Dr. OK said it.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:32]** I could be wrong, but I feel like Dr. OK was like, hey, here this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:35]** He's not suspicious.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:38]** He's just saying he's like, we found it in there with a bunch of goblins.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:39]** Lucky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:47]** Yeah, I mean, well, look, we spar a lot, or at least we used to, until I thought she stole it, and then I guess she didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:52]** So, look, thank you so, so much for this.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** I really appreciate this.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:55]** Wait, what about this side business?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:01]** Look, I like you here, but you're going to need to start calling me by my name if we're going to be friends here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:03]** Ah, grass.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:07]** Nico looks over at Tim and just kind of nods, and I'm like, okay, do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** All right, all right.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Fair enough, fair enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** Fair enough, yeah, yeah.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:15]** The side business, Algianas, what's all that about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:17]** So...

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:25]** I don't know too much, but I think Algiata and the captain have some, like, side business going on.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** Could be a little shady.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:33]** Sometimes we get, like, some unsavory cargo or passengers, and he looks over at Nico.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:38]** So, you know, it could just be... Nico just chuckles.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:40]** Uh-huh.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** You know, I...

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:49]** I think, personally, that Captain Ramin used to be involved in, like, some crime stuff, you know.

**[00:42:50 - 00:43:00]** I mean, growing up in Morrow, certainly you see your fair share of it, but I'm just saying, I think you can tell a spade when you see a spade.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:04]** So, look, you talked before about Lozu.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:08]** I'm sorry, sorry that you were shot, Nico, but...

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:08]** Here's the thing.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:16]** My knowledge of Lozu is that she really wants to be a star finder.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:20]** And she did not have an easy go being that.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:24]** So I think she's trying to get some experience under her belt.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:31]** And, you know, she asked me a little bit about, you know, she said that she had asked you all to help.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:37]** And I said, I probably would have done the same if I was somebody who made decisions like that.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** But that's not part of my job.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** But...

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** I think that was a good call.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:46]** You know, you kind of got to help her out, but she's a really good egg.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:50]** And I think I'm confident that one day that she'll be a star finder.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:51]** She'll kill it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:55]** So you have a lot of faith and trust in Lozu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** Absolutely.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:56]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:59]** Fascinating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** That makes me think that this is all backwards.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:03]** That Algiata's the good guy and Lozu is more and more bad.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:06]** I think she's got these people all fooled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Oh, my God.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:15]** Nico's going to look over at Graf and he's going to be like, look, sorry you feel I'm unsavory.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:19]** I'm an unsavory person to travel with.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:19]** I got shot.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:25]** Graf, I think you and I can both agree, like,

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:28]** If you were shot, you'd be wanted.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** You'd be looking for blood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:32]** Look, I totally get it.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:33]** It's fine.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** We weren't shot at either.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:40]** Sorry?

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** Nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:43]** I believe that trap was set for all of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:49]** It sounds, look, it's worrisome that Algiata has not turned up.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:54]** I mean, have you found out anything about where she is or what's going on?

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** Just, just.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** No, we have not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:56 - 00:45:01]** Well, it sounds like somebody doesn't want people finding out.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:10]** So for that, and he takes his glass, I'm going to toast you all for working on this, because, again, I trust Lozu's choice.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:15]** I think she made a good choice, so good luck trying to find Algiata.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:18]** Thank you, Grath, and cheers to your safety as well.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:25]** We claim glasses, and as we drink, Nico's going to do a sleight of hand check, and he's going to...

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:29]** He's kind of fake taking the drink, but he's going to close his lips.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** So no alcohol actually goes into his mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:32]** Okay.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** It just dribbles down the side of his face.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:38]** Give me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** Okay.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** That's an 18 plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** So you like turn your head and throw it over your shoulder type thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:45 - 00:46:12]** I feel like with that well I feel like it like maybe like goes like right in your mouth and then you kind of turn to put the glass down but you spit it right back out you know or like you know it's like it's so well done that it's just like a yeah and for people at home listening I turned around and mimicked doing that so yeah and Kevin did a shadow puppet version and Kevin did a shadow puppet version and it was better than I could have imagined I shed a tear because I'm that good


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** Look, hashtag Shadowmaster.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** Hashtag Shadowmaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:20]** I do want to... I do need to get out.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:24]** I was kind of let go a little early from the bridge.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:25]** During a crisis?

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** They're dealing with everything that's going on.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** They're dealing with what's going on.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:30]** Aren't you the pilot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:33]** You can't even pilot right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:35]** Yeah, so I just asked if I could go.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:41]** Look, I really want to start listening to... Do you guys like Strawberry Machine Cake?

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:44]** Give me a knowledge check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** Would I do that?

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** Would that be a culture check or a knowledge check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** Culture, sorry.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** Culture, culture, culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** Culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:53]** I don't even have culture.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** Oh, that's a 19 plus 7 for me.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** That's a 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Nice.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:00]** I just have to say that I don't know that.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** I don't have culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** Nico, you know that...

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:08]** Strawberry Machine Cake is like a super popular band.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:09]** Where are they from?

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:14]** I think they are from Absalom Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** I got a 26 on my culture check and I jam out.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** You also know.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** I don't know on a 26?

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** No, you also know.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:24]** I was like, I jam out all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:26]** Oh, they're great.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:27]** They're great.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:30]** I really like their first album.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** Shoot, what was the name of that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** Strawberry Shortcake, wasn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:38]** It wasn't a self-titled album.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:41]** No, no, no, no, no, no.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:45]** No, it's like a... I thought it was like Castroville Collision or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Yeah, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:54]** I just think Nico's going to say, look, I think it's just all a little bit derivative of the old archaeological find of Strawberry Fields forever, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** All right.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** Hey, everyone's a critic.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:57]** That's fine.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:05]** Look, I don't want to kick you all out, but I did just take two drinks, and I do kind of want to get to the gym before the rest of the day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** No, thank you for your time, Grath.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:09]** We do appreciate everything that you have told us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:10]** You are welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** Yes.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:12]** Bye, Grath.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** Hang on to your ring, Grath.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:16]** Yeah, thank you.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** Thank you again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:25]** Nico's going to do a little bit of a diplomacy check here, and he's just going to say, sorry about the intimidation here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:28]** Give me your diplomacy roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:43]** that is a seven plus what uh diplomacy plus six so that's a 13 what are you all thinking or do you want to play it out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:43 - 00:49:04]** rick just rolled a 21 for perception on his room just one last like look around okay yeah you don't find there's nothing of of note in his room there's nothing that stands out or anything no nope no secret doors all right what was the result uh john of the uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** Diplomacy roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** Like I said, look, I've been shot before.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:12]** Seems like maybe this might be one of your first times.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** I get shot.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:20]** I know that it can be a traumatic experience.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** So I totally get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:26]** He replies to Graf, and he's just like, look, it's not the first time being shot at.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:28]** It's the first time actually getting shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:29]** Right.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:32]** And, hey, I get it.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:34]** Everyone reacts differently when it happens.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** It's all right.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** So don't worry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:39]** Perhaps I can give you something, Nico, to calm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:46]** Oh, are you... Nico's going to... Shadow puppet of a needle coming into a neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** Nico's going to look over at Dr. Okay.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** He's like, keep your needles away from me, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:54]** Look, I'm going to get going.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:56]** Why don't we head on out?

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** I appreciate it, Nico.

**[00:49:59 - 00:49:59]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:03]** Rick's going to step into the hallway and do like a look up and down the hall.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** Do you want me to do a perception for that or is that just a... Yeah, give me a perception check.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** Natural 20, so 24.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** Impressive.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** Good job, Cap.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** What is everyone else doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:18]** Nika's going to echo along that sentiment.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:22]** He's going to roll for perception as well, just because he's looking.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:23]** Okay.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:25]** That's a natural 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:28]** He sees everyone kind of doing that, and so we'll do that as well.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** It's a nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:33]** He sees everyone looking scrutinously in the hallway.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** Yeah, kneeling over.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** Grath walks out behind you.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** What did you get here?

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** Nine.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** Nine.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:42]** Okay, cool.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:51]** Yeah, it seems pretty calm until from the south of the map, like where the double doors are, like here, right?

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:54]** So at the top there are the double doors that are like the bridge.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:59]** The south, you all investigated, those go down to the lower decks, right?

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:04]** From that direction, you do start to hear this like...

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** As if there's running.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:10]** And it gets louder and louder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** And then the doors... Nick is going to draw his gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** Yeah, Nico's going to draw both of his pistols.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:19]** Put you all where you are on the map.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:21]** Because right now, most of you are still in Grath's room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** How much movement do I get?

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:26]** Because I would start pacing down the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** I feel like you're probably right where you are, Nick.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:32]** Just put where everyone else is as they're coming out and scrutinizing the hallway.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:35]** That's probably where you could be, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:38]** Doctor, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** I feel like... You're still in the room?

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** No.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** Okay, you're right there?

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:44]** Okay.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:47]** As you step out...

**[00:51:48 - 00:52:09]** Then right at that moment, the doors open and you see Song looking like afraid, which is weird because their eyes, while they've been kind of salty in the past, they seem like terrified.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** And as soon as they see you.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:19]** they begin running down the corridor, looking afraid, uncertain, and they just start saying, please, please help.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** Look, I, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** Look, ripping apart.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:26]** They're, they're, they're shooting my arm.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** My, my, my data pet, please help.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Can, can you help?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:34]** And then it starts like beckoning you to come charge up to him and roll a perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:35]** Okay.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:37]** Natural 20.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:39]** So 24 for perception.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:41]** I want to look at him and look down the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** Seems totally flustered.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Totally flustered.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** Look, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:47]** The goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** Is there damage?

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** You said there was damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:49]** Yeah.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** Look, there is damage.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** There is the goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:54]** That's more for you, John, not for... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:54]** Yeah, no.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:56]** Well, I'm responding a song, okay?

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** There's damage.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** Please, just come.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** I really need your help.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** Grath, Grath, please, come on.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** And Grath is like, let's go, let's go, let's go.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:07]** And just starts running down the hallway as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** Where are we headed, son?


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:09]** Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:13]** Song starts walking really quickly.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:15]** Where did you leave your salt shaker?

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** This is not the time.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:21]** Do you want to fight right now, Dr. O'Kate?

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:21]** No.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:26]** He says, look, they're shooting up my data pad.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:30]** They shot it at me, and then they point at me.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** The goblins!

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** The goblins!

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** They're tearing everything apart.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** Please, please, come on, come on.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:37]** And starts keep walking down the hall.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** I need your help.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** I couldn't get a hold of anybody.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:42]** Grath is like, let's go, let's go, let's go.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** What is going on here?

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:47]** Alert the captain that we're going to dispatch of some goblins.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:49]** I've been trying to...

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:53]** Song just comes in and says, I've been trying to reach people.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** I can't reach anybody.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:56]** And then my data pad, it was damaged.

**[00:53:56 - 00:54:01]** And then Grath says, Where are they?

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** They're by the kitchen.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:02]** They're by the kitchen.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Please, please.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:07]** And Grath turns and says, Look, can you all handle this?

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:10]** Because I can tell the captain, but I will come if you need me to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:15]** Nico's going to look back at Graf just like, oh, come on, Graf, you're looking for a workout just a second ago.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** This sounds like it'll be fun.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** All right.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** All right.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** All right.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:18]** Let's go.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:18]** Let's go.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** And then starts to go down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** I think you should come with us.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:25]** Song, report to the bridge and tell them everything you see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Okay, okay.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** Are you sure?

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** You sure?

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:31]** Because I'm... What if they're up here?

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** I don't know.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:32]** Okay, okay.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** Okay, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:36]** If they're up here, then we should all go to... Uncharacteristically scared.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:40]** Yeah, we should just go to the bridge if they're going to try and take over the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:46]** So you all go ahead and put yourselves... Wait, can we pause for a second?

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:50]** Do you think there's more concern at the bridge than there is with these goblins?

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** Do you have time to talk about this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:53]** Should we ask Grath?

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** I mean, he would know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** Look, I have no idea.

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:00]** It sounds like there are some goblins tearing up the kitchen.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:01]** Who cares?

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:09]** That sounds like the... Well, they're shooting at our crew, so that is of importance to me.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:13]** It's trying to make a point to you that it doesn't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:18]** Song, I need you to calm down and please tell me exactly what you remember.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:20]** Were the goblins...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:43]** shooting at someone it is the space goblins they were shooting at me and then i walked over to see what they were doing and they were pulling panels apart and they were just it was terrifying and then and then they just hit the the data pad out of my hand the goblins are from the dreamliner and they were i they they were like shouting they were trying to look for something i i

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** I don't know.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:47]** Please, can I just get your help dealing with them?

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:54]** Because this doesn't happen, and I know I put up a front earlier, but now I am terrified, so can you please just help out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:00]** Rick will reluctantly nod and start heading down the hall.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Nico's already down the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:05]** Here's his going down the ladder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:07]** Going down, down, baby.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:10]** Down to the lower levels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:18]** I'll have enough of your guff after I dispatch these goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:18]** Give me one second.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** Oh, that's what I wanted right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:23]** Oh, he's got to set up all the enemies for us.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** It's going to be an ambush.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:24]** Great.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:25]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** So you all go down.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:30]** You go down the ladders.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:33]** You start to walk up.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** I'll show you on the map here.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** You start to walk up the hallway.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:40]** So you start to see it here.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:42]** You start to walk down the hallway.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:45]** You don't see anything down the hallway.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** But as you...

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** Begin to approach.

**[00:56:51 - 00:57:02]** You do... Like, the T intersection where the cafeteria is, you do start to hear some, like... Get out of here!

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:08]** And then, like... And these sounds of, like, frantic voices looking.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** You're in the hallway.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:13]** You can hear around the corner here.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:16]** You hear, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:18]** Get out of my way.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** Just get a goodness.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** I'm going to push you to steal it.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** Then I'm going to take it.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** Why are you already doing that?

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** And then choop, choop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** What are you doing?

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** Song and Grath are behind you.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:30]** Song is behind the corner.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** Grath is behind you as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** Rick will take the lead.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:35]** Yeah, here's us moving up alongside him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:43]** And we're going to approach the corners, and then Rick is going to do... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** Song stays back.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:46]** Grath comes up behind Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:52]** I'm going to hit myself beforehand with a booster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:57]** And Rick has swapped to his artillery laser, his azimuth type.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:57]** Okay.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** Artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:01]** Because Nico's got both of his pistols you're on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** Okay.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** Nico pulls both of his pistols.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** Rick switches to his azimuth laser pistol.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:06]** Dr.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** O.K.?

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** Artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:09]** Artillery laser pistol.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:12]** I have my... No, no, pistol.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:14]** It's a... Artillery laser rifle pistol.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:14]** It's a cannon.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:15]** It's a cannon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:19]** Prehistoric Napoleonic era cannon.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** Dr.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:20]** O.K., what do you do?

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:23]** is preparing a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:43]** basic booster for himself as soon as combat starts because he's presuming combat's gonna start and he has his tactical syringe spear equipped okay and here's what are you doing sorry uh here's wants to know if there's any ammunition in that gun that he picked up i think not but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** You do, yeah.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:48]** So the ice carbine can hold 20 charges.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:51]** 10 of them were expended in the shot that hit Nico's chest.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** And then there are 10 left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:55]** Oh, all right.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:56]** Well, great.

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:00]** Here's, we'll then have that ready to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:00]** Okay.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:01]** You're proficient in that, correct?

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** That is a good question.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:04]** I think it's an advanced range weapon.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** Let me look, but I'm pretty sure-


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:11]** Weapon proficiencies is on the top left side under profile.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:14]** It'll say weapon proficiencies, advanced melee.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:16]** I have advanced melee, basic melee, grenades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** It's not advanced melee.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:21]** I think it's... Long arm?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:22]** Heavy weapons?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** No, let's see.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:27]** Basic melee weapons and small arms are what you are proficient with.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** Yes.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:35]** And that particular... Can't you still use it, though, but at a disadvantage on your roll?

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** That's a really good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:39]** I thought that's how it works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:39]** Let's find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** I think you're right, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** I think so, too.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:47]** It is a long arm, it looks like, I think.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:50]** I have proficiency with long arms.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** Yeah, it's a long arm.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:56]** All characters are proficient with any natural weapons they might have.

**[00:59:56 - 01:00:01]** If you use a weapon with which you are not proficient, you take a minus four penalty to attack rolls with that weapon.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** Yikes.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:03]** That's pretty heavy.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** Yeah.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:07]** That's not nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:09]** Well, he still wants to try it out.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:14]** He's going to have it ready, and he'll keep it in mind that he's not proficient in it, though.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:17]** So you're going to ready that weapon?

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:17]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:20]** Okay.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:24]** Sorry, Rick will look back and say, are you sure you know how to use that thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** Do I know how to use it?

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** You're funny.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** You're funny.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:33]** Let's just get started.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:35]** Nico's going to chuckle under his breath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:44]** So you all, Grath looks over at Rick and it hears and nods and pulls out an azimuth laser pistol.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:45]** Nice.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:51]** And as you all turn the corner, maybe you just peek around the corner.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** Do you walk around the corner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:53]** What do you do?

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** I will peek around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** You're going to peek around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:58]** Do you want me to roll a stealth and a...

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** Perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:02]** I don't think you need to roll a perception check.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** Just give me a stealth check if you're just trying to peek.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:06]** It's very apparent.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** Oh, man.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** I rolled a four.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:09]** Sorry.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** You said I rolled a three.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** Four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:15]** So it's for stealth, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** Yeah, I rolled a four for stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** Okay.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:26]** So I got this giant rifle, and as I turned a corner to try to peek, I just dragged the rifle barrel along the wall and just goes...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:40]** And as that happens, you look around the corner, and the four space goblins are standing there, and they are frantically tearing up everything in sight.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:43]** Pieces of the ship's interior are scattered on the floor.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:45]** There are mechanical pipes that are pulled off.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:51]** Chaos seems to reign in that they're shouting at each other, pushing one another when one of them finds something.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:53]** And as soon as that...

**[01:01:54 - 01:02:11]** that scrape happens they all four turn see you and shout no one will stop the new bloods and that's our game it's time for our dick of the week


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:15]** Ah, great.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** Goblins again.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:18]** What are they up to this time?

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:20]** I don't care what Graf thinks.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:22]** I don't think Lozu is beyond suspicion.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:25]** She could even be being mind-controlled.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:27]** That moment in the dark hallway?

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:27]** Oof.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:30]** Too spooky and weird to ignore.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:33]** I still can't help but feel like we're getting closer.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:37]** Especially closer to this relic I keep hearing about.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:41]** Is it a weapon that's going to help me, I mean, us out?

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:44]** Or some ancient thing?

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:48]** Or something that's at least worth a hefty amount of credits?

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:52]** I have to find out what it is.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:55]** I'm glad you're with us on this journey, though.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:58]** I know we're going to find out together soon.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:01]** See you next We'll Save Wednesday.


## Speaker_0

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:36]** Thank you.
