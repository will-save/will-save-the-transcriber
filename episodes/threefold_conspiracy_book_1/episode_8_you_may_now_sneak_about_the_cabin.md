**[00:00:00 - 00:00:06]** Last time on We'll Save, the plot thickens for our reluctant adventurers.

**[00:00:07 - 00:00:16]** As our crew set out to find answers to this perplexing chain of events, the group seems divided over the apparent direness of the situation.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:25]** After a conversation with the first officer of the Chimera, Lozu, the crew begins to recharge in their quarters.

**[00:00:26 - 00:00:37]** After some good sleep and some hobgoblin mischief, Lozu stopped by to inform our adventurers of the disappearance of the security officer, Algiada.

**[00:00:37 - 00:00:42]** Just as Rick-19 reaches out to further question Lozu, the ship lights shut off.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:46]** What new dangers are in store for our adventurers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:41]** You know, I was thinking lately.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:45]** And by lately, I kind of mean...

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** Right before we started recording.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:55]** We were talking about how there was a time when you had to remember people's cell phone numbers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** And it got me thinking.

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:00]** Remember their cell phone numbers or just their numbers?

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:00]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:00]** Sorry.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:01]** Good point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** They didn't even have a cell phone.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** Yeah.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** What was a cell phone?

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** It's like a car phone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:12]** Reaching out to younger viewers or listeners, they don't even know what we're talking about at this point.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:14]** What do you mean not a cell phone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** This is prehistoric.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** Before history was written.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:20]** Yeah, we're talking about the days of flip phones.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** Before flip phones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** No, this is before flip phones.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** This is landlines.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** Yeah, this is just landlines.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:27]** This is the crappy cordless that I had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:34]** I remember the first cordless phone that we got that was like battery operated hand thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:37]** Yeah, and you put it on a charger like on the thing next to the couch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:39]** And it could only be 10 feet away or else it starts losing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Yeah.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:43]** And it had like 15 minutes of charge maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:43]** Yep.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Yep.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** And then you got yelled at when you lost it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:51]** And the antenna you could hit somebody with because it was made of like hard metal.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** The whip cord?

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** Yeah.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:55]** It wasn't just metal.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** It was like a car antenna.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:59]** You could stab someone with it for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** It was like coiled metal.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** So it was like the bumpers for your door.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:05]** It would just like fling and flick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:11]** Speaking of cars, do you guys remember the phones that were actually wired into the car?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** My cousin in Utah had a car phone.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** Yeah.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** My mom had one too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:19]** Well, now that we just lost everyone who's under 21, so it's fine.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:21]** They're not going to listen anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** It's like 28 now, I'm sure.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** 28.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:23]** That's 28.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** Good riddance.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:30]** Now we can talk about the internet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:38]** Exactly.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:38]** Think back to that time.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:43]** When did you start doing video games, barrel rolls?

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Yeah, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:45 - 00:04:07]** um i grew up like i was original master race so um back pre windows 95 i was playing computer games and i didn't have consoles growing up until like maybe the ps the original playstation same yeah um but it was great there was like jill of the jungle and like a bunch of like cool jurassic park games and one called secret agent mine was an xbox

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** That was your first console?

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Was it Xbox?

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** Whoa.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Yeah.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:11]** That's intense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:15]** I traded in for PS2, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** First console for me.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:23]** Video games for me were just kind of... Originally, they were something that we got at daycare.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** We'd go to daycare every once in a while.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** And, yeah.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:32]** It was just... You played, like, Donkey Kong on a PlayStation or...

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]** I remember, yeah, one of them had an Atari.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:38]** The first console I think I ever got was a Game Boy Color.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** Yeah.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** Game Boy Color.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:40]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:42]** Pokemon Yellow and Pokemon Red.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** Pokemon Yellow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:45]** I did have a Game Boy original.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** I had the original Game Boy.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** Me too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** Same, same.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:48]** Just same.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:51]** My first system was actually Nintendo.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** Wait, was it what, Kev?

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:53]** The NES.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** Nintendo Entertainment.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:55]** Wow.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** Not an Atari.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:58]** I had a neighbor that had an Atari.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:01]** We got the NES, and then we got a Sega shortly after that.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** A used Sega, mind you.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:03]** Sega.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:03]** Sega.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** Oh, Sega Genesis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:05]** You guys are rich.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** The original was Sonic the Hedgehog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** You guys were the rich kids, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** Playing ToeJam & Earl and Sonic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:13]** Dude, I wish I never got a Sega.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** They looked amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:16]** ToeJam & Earl, oh, that game was my favorite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:18]** Yeah, classic.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:21]** I only played at neighbor friends' houses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:36]** i remember when my neighbor had got playstation and i was like what is this playstation you're talking about and then i got one shortly after that but dude like the sega no i wasn't rich but that's pretty good sonic the hedgehog looked amazing sonic yeah yeah but it was great


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** No, just go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:40]** I was going to say, back to the role-playing stuff.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]** I grew up on video games.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** Video games were my thing.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:52]** And then also, I was a huge wrestling fan all through elementary school and middle school and even high school.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** Who wasn't?

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:58]** Yeah, but being in a mobile home, our porches were elevated up.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:16]** you know patios and so yeah so you're in a ring it was yeah it was a ring so we would all come like our patio was empty and so like we'd all go on the porch and i would we would wrestle and powerbomb and choke slam and all that stuff onto that is outrageous

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:20]** I always played Kane because he was my favorite.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** But that was another form of role-playing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:33]** I didn't actually start playing... I think I really channeled Macho Man Randy Savage.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** I don't know anything about wrestling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** It's never too late, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:42]** My first video game RPG experience was probably...

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:47]** The first time I played, like if you, it depends what you really count, right?

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:50]** Like Mario is like an adventure game, right?

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** But it's set.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** There's not a lot of role play in Mario.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:53]** Yeah.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:53]** Yeah.

**[00:06:54 - 00:07:01]** Like it really, maybe Zelda, but I would always just play it like at friends' houses.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** So it wasn't really like my own, right?

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:08]** Like you would just be like, oh, I have to go get this item or whatever.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Right.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:18]** I think the first role playing game, it was scary as shit because I think it was on PlayStation two and I was playing resident evil.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** Oh yeah.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** The first one.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** And it was one.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** What's that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:24]** I think resident evil one was on PlayStation one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:30]** Oh, maybe it was on PlayStation, but I remember.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** No.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:35]** Well, I remember playing it in like my cousin's, uh,

**[00:07:36 - 00:08:02]** bedroom basically with like all the lights off and it was like a windy cold night in massachusetts with like all types of like creeks this super old ass house and like i was freaked the f out like the whole rest of the trip because i had just been like fighting zombies and undead people like i was probably like 13 i don't know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:04]** I mean, that is, yeah.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:07]** I was never a Resident Evil fan, but kind of for that reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:10]** Resident Evil came out on PlayStation in 1996.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:14]** Okay, so I was, wow, 14.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** I was, wow, wow.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:18]** No, 16.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** I don't know.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** I can't do math.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:49]** uh i played muds if you want to if you want to drop the uh 14.4 kilobaud modem played multiplayer online dungeons which were like telnet dungeons nice some of them but i never played uh dnd in person because i didn't didn't have a nerdy enough friends in real life what kelly i was gonna say some of the muds were like free of graphics it was just like you had to cut it was like tech they were like text based yeah some of the early ones that sounds cool

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:49]** Really?

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:50]** Right.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** You just type Go North.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** With Choose Your Own Adventure?

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:54]** Yeah.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:54]** Oh, wow.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** That's cool.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** But online is really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** I kind of want to play that now.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** If you look it up, M-U-D.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** That's awesome.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** We could just stream that.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:04]** We all just play for 15 minutes.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:07]** We all just play that and see what happens.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:08]** That'd be great.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** What about you, Nick?

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** Or Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** Go ahead, Nick.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:17]** I think my first experience with an RPG game, a true RPG game,

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:29]** Not tabletop, just RPG was... And for any of you Star Wars fans out there, especially those Star Wars fans that played the original KOTOR, this is going to be an infamy.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** I actually started on KOTOR 2.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** Nice.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** I started on KOTOR 2.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** Still...

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:39]** It was still a great game.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:44]** Kreia, I think by far is, I think one of the most flushed out villains ever.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Seriously.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:51]** Like cinema has missed the boat by not having such a strong female complicated villain.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** It was, it was a really great story all the way through.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:57]** Um, I played that game so many times through.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:01]** Every now and then when I get a feeling of nostalgia, I'll still play it.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:06]** But my first time playing a tabletop role-playing game was D&D with the crew here.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:13]** I still remember just that we were trying to sneak up on a bear together with a bow and arrow.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** I was like, how do I do this?

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:18]** Um...

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:26]** But no, tabletop RPG games, it was never really an option for me.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** No one really played it around me when I was growing up.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:32]** I think I would have gotten into it sooner if I had a group of friends like this.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** Much to Will's similarity.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:40]** My first time playing was with you guys.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** And it was awesome.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** And I saw the white.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** And then here we are.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:46]** Kelly, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:56]** I had played D&D a few times sporadically before meeting this group, but it never really stuck with me until this group for sure.

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:06]** It was just sporadically, but the D&D campaign we did was great, and it finally sold me on it, which was really fun.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:13]** The first, I think, RPG that I ever did play was probably Final Fantasy IX, and KOTOR is great.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** That's such a good game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** Do you know you can get Kotor for your cell phone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:17]** Really?

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:20]** Yeah, you can just download it from the App Store.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:20]** Wow.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:21]** It's so crazy.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** Let's do it.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:30]** Let's jump back in to the dark, scary things that happened last episode when you all were talking in the hallway.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:33]** If there are no zombies, I'll be fine.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** I didn't promise anything.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:35]** I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:39]** It was the asbestos that did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:46]** Why do I feel like we're on now like the murder at the Orient Express?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** Yeah, this is going to get bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:54]** I was actually going for like stepbrothers when they're doing the pranks and they walked in.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:56]** He just died this morning.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** It was the asbestos.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:58]** He did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** So you all, the lights go out.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:10]** You hear the as the ship powers down.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:30]** Then after a moment, emergency lighting kind of flickers and illuminates the area with this like bluish tint kind of along the walkways at the bottom and at the top.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:37]** And there's this voice that comes over the intercom.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:43]** Folks, this is your captain, Swaking.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:56]** We've had a bit of a hitch in our systems, and unfortunately, it seems we've lost power to our thrusters.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:03]** Rest assured, though, that our capable chief engineer is on the job, and

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:06]** We will have the problem fixed as soon as possible.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:13]** Once we get this fixed, I'll speak with our pilot.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:18]** We'll see if we can't make up for any of this lost time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:24]** Nico's going to turn around to the rest of the group and he's just going to say the first thing that comes to his mind.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** Anybody else thinking what I'm thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** What are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** Yeah, what's that?

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** Pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:34]** I'm sorry you all.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** I have to go.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** Again, thank you.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** Looza.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Looza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** Looza, please.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** I need to ask you or tell you something important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:49]** Is it quick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:53]** Can you tell us what you know about the Vesk that was on board?

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:54]** The Vesk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:01]** I think his name is, I mean, he's just a passenger.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** That's about it.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** His name is Trostanek.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** He is not just a passenger.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:12]** He had something to do with Officer Aljida, Aljada.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** Algiata.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** Okay.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:14]** Okay.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** Thank you.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** Thank you for bringing this to my attention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** Can I roll a sense motive on her kind of?

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:19]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** Go ahead.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:24]** It's 17 plus four.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** That's a 21.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Oh, you got it.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:26]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** Yeah.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** She seems genuinely flustered.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:36]** She seems like this is not necessarily information that she is like looking for at this time, but she's appreciative.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:41]** And she just seems very busy because now the power just went out on her ship and she's the first officer.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:42]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** Thank you.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:49]** No, I am concerned that this is something to do with Algiada and the Vesk.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** They were planning something.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:52]** We overheard their conversations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:52]** Oh.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:53]** Yes.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:53]** Okay.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:55]** Wow.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:56]** Okay.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:00]** Look, let me just go confer with the captain.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:05]** I need to figure out what's going on with the ship, make sure everything's in stock.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** Thank you for telling me this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:12]** Of course, I'm— I suggest that we join you as you go to entertain the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:14]** Are you going to the security room?

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:17]** No, I'm going to go to the deck, talk to the captain.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:18]** Thank you.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** It's okay.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** Please wait here.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:22]** You all are the passengers on the ship.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:24]** There's nothing to worry about too much.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** It seems like it's okay.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** I'm just going to go handle this.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** We can talk later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:33]** Well, in the absence of security, and Dr. O.K.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:42]** is going to pull out his syringe, tactical spear, we could provide our own security.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:44]** I appreciate it, but I'm not asking.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:49]** Rick will pull his trench coat back and show his pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** I appreciate it.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:54]** I do not think you are in any danger.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:56]** There's no issue to safety here.

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:00]** Just please, I'm going to go figure out what's going on.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** We can talk about this again later.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** Again, I don't think you'll need any of that.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:07]** It's good to know that you are capable.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:10]** I have been told that you're capable.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** So again, thank you.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** We'll talk soon.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:16]** And she kind of starts to walk past you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:19]** Louisa, I have concern for your safety.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** Look, I appreciate it.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** I'm going to go.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** I appreciate it.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:23]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:26]** Before she leaves, Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:32]** is going to try and stab her around in her pockets.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** Really?

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** Here's is going to assist.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:37]** For an access key or anything like that.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** Okay.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:39]** If that's a thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:45]** Okay, so as she's walking away, you want to pickpocket her, sleight of hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:47]** I'll just casually bump into her.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:47]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:51]** She was not walking in your direction, but that's okay.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** I could follow.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** Okay, give me a roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** Well, okay.

**[00:16:55 - 00:17:00]** I would have done it back here, but I rolled an 18 plus 5.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:01]** That's a 23.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** Wow.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:04]** Okay.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:06]** 18 plus five, 23.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** Okay.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** And you were assisting with that here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** Yeah, but I have a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:14]** Can you assist on sleight of hand?

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:14]** Well done.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** Rolling high.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** Okay.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** So you would add two.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:19]** So that's a 25.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** Yeah.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** So you reach in.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:26]** You are able to reach into her pocket as she kind of starts to leave.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:28]** She doesn't seem to notice.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:31]** You don't feel any access key.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** Shucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:35]** Damn.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** And she walks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** She didn't have anything on her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** Nico's going to look over at Dr. Okay.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** Not even an access key?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** Maybe they used biometrics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:52]** If you all... I'm sorry about this situation, Song starts to address you.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:56]** If you all want to come in, we can have breakfast.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** Please, please come in.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:59]** And Song turns to walk in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:59 - 00:17:59]** That's all right.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** I'm okay.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:00]** I'm...

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** Oh, that's okay.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** I would like to check engineering.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:09]** Nico's going to start to wander this way a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:10]** Excuse me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:13]** Song walks into the cafeteria.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:15]** Excuse me, Nico.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** Could you hold on for a second?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** It's the professor in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:23]** Could I talk to all of you in my quarters?

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:25]** Oh, no.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** Is that okay?

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Come on.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:29]** Here, here.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Of course, Professor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** All right, Professor.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:35]** As you wish, just so long as you got the whiskey in your room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:39]** I'm not much of a drinker these days, but I will certainly enjoy it.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:43]** I won't begrudge anyone who wants to partake.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:45]** So you walk in.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:48]** Oh, whoa.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:48]** He goes.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:49]** He sits down.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:50]** Oh.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:51]** On his bed.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** Are you not coming in, Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** I came in.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:56]** Sorry.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** I couldn't click on my dude for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** Professor Benjamin sits on the bed.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:05]** Brow kind of creases.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:07]** Concerned.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:14]** Kind of looks a little older than his maybe graying hair suggests.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:18]** Nico got a 20 on his sense motive.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:18]** I'm trying to

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:38]** read to see i'm trying to read him to see if he is worried for a reason or just kind of wildly worried is his if he seems if it's concerned seems focused based off his body expressions or if it's just general panic


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:42]** I'm going to let you know that after I say everything because he hasn't said anything.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:51]** He generally looks, he sits down, his brow kind of creases, kind of fumbles with like a pen.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** He's got a little pen in his hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:06]** I don't know if you're concerned about events on board, but the disappearance of the security chief

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:38]** this loss of thrusters it's left me a little uneasy I maybe it's just the events from the cube last night lingering I don't that was a little jarring but you all were there you all were so helpful um but I I can't help but think are these events connected maybe I'm I'm just being overly cautious but uh

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:43]** Look, I'm transporting a valuable relic.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:50]** And I can't dismiss these things as mere coincidence.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:54]** What if someone has disabled the ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:55 - 00:21:01]** They've put the security chief out of commission to steal my cargo.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:05]** Professor kind of removes the spectacles here.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:26]** Just, I, I hate to ask this, but given how you've handled the mishap with the broken containment box, uh, fumbles now with his spectacles, um, would you all be willing to do me a personal favor and look into this security chief?

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:30]** You all seemed like you, I don't know, maybe you're

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:35]** I don't know what your take was, but I can pay you.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:38]** I can pay you once we reach Absalom.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:43]** I'm not sure how interested you were, but I can pay you once we reestablish connections.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** I can do it.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:51]** Professor, I believe that the security officer might be involved in this attempted hijacking.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:54]** Okay.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** How so?

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:00]** Let's just call it android intuition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:06]** What Rick means is... The probabilities look good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:12]** We overheard some things that might appear as though she's connected.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:17]** Alright.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** I think we need to take some precautions.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:25]** Perhaps we could apply a bit of misdirection.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** Do you have this item on you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** The relic?

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** Where is the relic?

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** What is the relic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:40]** I'm keeping it in the cargo hold.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:43]** Professor, I suggest we go to the cargo hold immediately.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:47]** Look, no, I am worried.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:50]** You see that I am not that capable.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** Look, I... Professor.

**[00:22:54 - 00:23:00]** Nico, you can tell that he's really nervous about this relic.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:09]** And you can tell in general that when Rick brought up Algiada, that he really seemed concerned.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:13]** And you can tell that when he said it was in the cargo hold...

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:31]** that he did so pretty reluctantly but the way he said it you can tell that maybe he's not really willing to say exactly like he really doesn't want to impart any of this information or say anything about it and all right i'm gonna roll something real quick here and i'm gonna follow up here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:36]** That's going to be a 17, 10, plus 7.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** On what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:40]** 17, 10, plus 7?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:44]** No, 10 plus... 17 total, 10 plus 7.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:44]** On what?

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** It's a diplomacy check.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** And this is what he's going to say for it.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:52]** He's going to be like, Professor, what do we know that you're not telling us?

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:57]** First of all, I want to know who you're transporting this relic for.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** Is this relic...

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** of the nature of weaponry.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:08]** And three, who do you know that might want this?

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:12]** I have a pretty good idea that you were worried about a very specific group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:17]** I'm not worried about any group.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** I'm worried about the relic.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:23]** I don't really want to talk about it right now.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** I'm worried about it.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:33]** I'm asking you all if you could please just look into this disappearance.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** That's it.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:37]** You don't need to protect the relic.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:42]** Per se, I'm just trying to make sure that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:49]** I'm not so inclined to help someone who won't be straightforward with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:53]** I think it's just better that I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:59]** Look, I don't lift my blaster unless I absolutely have to.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:01]** And right now, this doesn't seem like something I have to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:03]** Then I...

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** All right.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:09]** Professor, I will investigate this for you, but I do think that you should come with us.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:14]** I don't think you would be safe either by yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:17]** I don't know that I'm worried about me per se.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:24]** I'm happy to come with you, but I feel safest in here and maybe go in and get some breakfast.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** I'm a little hungry.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:29]** It's not so crazy.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:31]** He seems very flustered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:33]** I'm going to roll another diplomacy check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:44]** Professor, what is protecting this relic from being just taken from the Kugelhold?

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:46]** What would stop someone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** I don't... I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:54]** Nico rolled a 16 total for his next diplomacy check.

**[00:25:54 - 00:26:02]** And he's going to say, Professor, if someone walked up and asked you to do the same thing you're asking us to do with the little knowledge that you've given us, would you do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** One, I'm going to say in general.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:11]** We don't just want to keep rolling diplomacy checks to try and just succeed and succeed.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:14]** But I will say that he seems pretty stalwart.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:17]** He's like, I understand.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:23]** I just – I don't want to – I don't really want to get into it.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** Maybe it's not in the cargo hold.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** I don't know.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:29]** Okay, so no more diplomacy checks.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** But I'll do intimidation instead.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:33]** You can do intimidation if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:33]** That's fine.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** No, Rick's going to take his leave.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** So he's like, don't worry, Professor.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:38]** I will look into this.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** And then he's going to turn and shoot for the door.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** He's going to shoot the door?

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** No, shoot for the door.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** Start walking towards it.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:47]** Roll for initiative against the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** Door got a high initiative score?

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:49]** No.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** I'm just trying to get him to talk.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** I'm just trying to get him to talk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:56]** He's being very cagey about all this.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:01]** You literally asked him, what do you know on a deployment?

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** That doesn't make sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:05]** Diplomacy is more like trying to convince somebody.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** I'm not trying to be diplomatic.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** I'm trying to convince him.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** There's a difference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Well, then that'd be persuasion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:14]** There is no persuasion.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:21]** But you weren't asking him questions as part of being, quote, diplomatic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** Oh, no, you're right.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** Diplomacy is persuade.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:32]** You can persuade others to be friendly towards you, resolve conflicts and differences, and learn common knowledge or rumors floating around a settlement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:32]** Yeah.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:35]** I'm not just trying to roll and roll until I succeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:38]** I'm just trying different avenues.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:41]** You literally just asked him, where are you taking this?

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** Who are you taking it to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:48]** I didn't even get who he's taking it on behalf of, which I thought would be- No, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** It's not a diplomatic check, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:52]** Wouldn't that be a diplomatic check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** No.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** It is a diplomatic check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** Yeah.

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:02]** It would be a diplomacy check to try and change his- His mind.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** Yeah, about doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** It also has gather information.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:10]** You can use diplomacy to gather information about a specific topic or individual.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:18]** And then the information sought DC is – this would probably be obscure or secret knowledge, prominent or well-known knowledge.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:22]** Oh, but that's like for an area, not a – I don't know.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** There's like a list.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** Yeah.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:29]** No, this is something good and I think it's just important to say that –

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** Kelly, are you trying to say something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:32]** In a bit.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** I'm good.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:33]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** Okay.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** Sorry.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:39]** There is the case that you cannot get all information that you want from people.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:42]** Sometimes it is you didn't meet at EC.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:45]** Sometimes it is they are just not willing to do it.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:48]** You know, it's like there are times when like that just won't be said.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** That won't come out.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** So just telling you that's the way you do that.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** Anyway, we can get back to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:54 - 00:29:02]** Before we go, I'd like to roll Perception on the room to see if there's anything out of place or he's shuffled through anything recently.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:04]** Sure.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** Go ahead.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:07]** Natural 20.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:10]** You take in the room for all that it is.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** The room is...

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:18]** Doesn't seem like it's anything to miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:20]** Yeah, not from last night.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:24]** His luggage isn't, like, different or anything like that.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:25]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:29]** What a waste of a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:33]** Look, Rick19 said that he would help me.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:37]** I understand if you all don't want to help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:44]** I am interested for my own reasons about the disappearance of this security officer.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:52]** However, I'm not sure about you, Professor Benjamin, so-called academic.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** Good day.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:54]** Good day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:56 - 00:30:03]** While Dr. OK was doing that, Nico took out his data pad and he turned toward the computer console.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:16]** He's just going to say back to the professor, don't get the wrong idea about this, but if you need to get in touch with us for whatever reason, I'm going to link my data pad to your wall communicator here.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:19]** All you need to do is just contact us.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** But

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:22]** That's not all Nico's doing with that.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:32]** He's also trying to get a secure audio tap that's going on all the time so he can monitor the professor.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** That'd be a bluff check.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** It's computer stack.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:36]** Yeah.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:42]** I'm just going to say right now, that's a pretty, it's possible, but it's not going to be easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** I'll assist then.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** I have pretty high computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** I have plus seven on computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** That's true, but here's the thing.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:54]** Do you all know that he's doing this?

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:54]** No.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:57]** Would you reasonably aid?

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** Okay.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:01]** All right.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Thank you, Nico.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:08]** Again, here's... Are you going to help me, Nico, in here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:12]** That's a 24 on the roll, by the way, for the computer sec.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:15]** Okay.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:17]** You don't get an audio tap.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:21]** You said that it's in the cargo bay or it might not be in the cargo bay.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** So which is it?

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:26]** Do you have someone else here helping you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:30]** No, there's no one else here helping me.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** It's just me.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** Do you have another one of those cubes on you?

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** I don't have any cubes.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:36]** I'm not in the room.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:37]** Yeah, I didn't think so.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:41]** No, there's no one else helping me.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:44]** Look, I just asked for your help.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:47]** If you can help me, then I would appreciate it.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** Whatever.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** Let me know.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** Why not?

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** At this point, we're just dawdling.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** Come on, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** Sorry, what?

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:00]** So Nico's going to walk out now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:05]** I will be completely honest with you, Nick, and tell you that you did not meet the DC that I had for this.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** You were close, but you did not meet the DC.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** So that's a real thing.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** Just saying.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** All right.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** So you all leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:22]** Uh, well, as soon as, as soon as Rick and, uh, as soon as Dr. Okay comes out into the hallway and that the other two were still inside, uh, Rick is going to turn to Dr. Okay.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:25]** And say like, I think we should head down to that cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:27]** We should check this vest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** That is also a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:31]** Nico turns around to the group.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:34]** He's like, I think the first thing we should do is we need more information.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** I'm not comfortable doing any of this.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:40]** I think the first place we should go is to the security room and try to get some sort of a tap.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:43]** and see what kind of eyes and eyes that we can get on the place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:50]** I don't mean to step on your toes and he looks down and like pulls his foot kind of away from your feet.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** Cause he's awkward.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:55]** Uh, but he says, uh, but we, Dr. Okay.

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:02]** And I, we overheard this conversation and I am convinced that there is something malicious going on here.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** Your security cameras are not going to help you.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:08]** I tried to explain this to you last night, but you were intoxicated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** Guilty as charged on that bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** You were pretty wasted.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** With that, he reaches forward and pushes the doorbell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:19]** Also pushes the doorbell on the vest room.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** Okay.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:29]** Nico does call back over to Rick's shoulder, though you had to admit it is a very wild story and not easily believed on the first pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:33]** He looks you in the eye and then pushes the doorbell again.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:36]** Nothing happens.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:40]** Can I hack it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:43]** Can you hack it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:50]** How would we break this door open without... Nico, roll a computer stack.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** Can I use a manipulate module?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:58]** So you can either give me an engineering check or you can give me a computers check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:02]** I'll give you a computers check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:04]** I will help with that as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** Nico's going to fail on the aid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:11]** For being an android, I have no computer skills whatsoever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Wait, you're an android.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** How do you have no computer skills?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** Because I am a computer.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** I got a 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** You got a 26?

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** Here's rolled a 20.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:22]** You rolled a 20?

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:23]** Okay.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** So here's rolled a 20.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:28]** 20 on the die or 20 with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:29]** Oh.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:32]** No, 20 total, unfortunately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** So you did aid, so it's a 28.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** So you did a computer's check.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** The door opens.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** Rick draws his gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:45]** This room... Nico draws both of his pistols.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** ...is...

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:51]** Much like the other passenger cabins.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:59]** The bed is unmade, tossed as if a restless sleeper.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:07]** But the rest of the room is pretty tidy, free of really any personal effects.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:14]** You look over, there's a shiny hard shell suitcase that's tucked under the desk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:38]** nico's gonna walk here he's gonna we'll see it and uh he's gonna say what do we have here what are you all doing i rolled a 22 on perception okay are all of you in the room yes i'm going to stay outside just in case he comes back okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** He's obviously not here, right?

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** Yeah, he's not in the room.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:46]** So I want to block the doorway while they go rummage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:49]** Do you leave the door open or the door closed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** Maybe open.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** Open, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** So here's, you were saying?

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:56]** Here's checks to see if the suitcase is openable.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** Just if it's not locked.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:02]** So he starts to fiddle with it, looking for a lock.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:02]** Okay.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** Does he find one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** Can we just like take 10?

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:11]** Like, is there anything that would indicate that he, or actually, I don't know.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:16]** He or she, Vesk, isn't like up to no good.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:19]** Like, is there any sign of like, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** Foul play.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:20]** Foul play.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** Serious behavior.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** It looks tidy.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** There aren't really a lot of personal effects around.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** There's the suitcase.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:27]** That's about it.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:30]** Here's do you go open the suitcase?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** I do try to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** Careful for traps, gentlemen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:34]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** Okay.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:37]** You open the suitcase.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** It opens pretty easily.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Do-do-do-do.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:44]** Inside, it's like a jumbled mess.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:46]** The clothes are kind of shoved in.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:50]** Maybe seems like it was just packed pretty quickly.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:51]** Got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** All right.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** So here's this going to be getting on our way.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:58]** Fiddle around with the inside and see if there's any other effects besides clothes.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** So, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:02]** I will.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** And that is a 14.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:06]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** 14.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Okay.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:13]** You think that... Let's do this.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:20]** If you take 20 on it, you can do that, but you might be there for longer.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:21]** You see what I'm saying?

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** Do you want to do that?

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Yeah, I do.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:25]** Okay.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:29]** So you start searching a bit longer, and...

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:38]** In one of the closed pockets, right, you find a little small gift-wrapped package.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:43]** It's kind of tucked away in an interior pocket.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:58]** And there's like a holographic tag on the gift that reads, from your loving wife, in the same pocket as a folded note.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** Dr. Roque, give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:06]** Oh, no.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:06]** 21.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** 21 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:09]** Or 20.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:10]** 18 on the die.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** Three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** Okay.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:19]** So the door to the cafeteria down the hall slides open.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:23]** I'm going to carefully whisper, guys, time to leave.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** And Song steps out and sees you.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Ah, Dr. O.K.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:30]** Look, I wanted to apologize about everything that happened earlier.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** I hope everything is all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:37]** How can you let me assist you?

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:44]** So I'm kind of like trying to block line of sight for the guys coming out.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:49]** Rick will step outside the door, like one step outside the door, because he realizes what's going on.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** He's going to fall away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Is there anything that you need?

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** I don't... I'm just asking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** Is everything okay?

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** We were just checking on with the professor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:06]** Thank you for checking in with us.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** We appreciate it.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:12]** My question is, how can Song see us in this dimly lit hallway?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:15]** Because androids have darkvision?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** Fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:19]** Actually, they have low light.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** Sorry, low light vision.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** Oh, no, they do have dark vision.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:21]** 60 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:23]** Are you guys looking for Trostenec?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:24]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:30]** Well, I think... We were talking with the professor.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Yes.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:34]** Is the professor okay?

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** He's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:35]** Yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:38]** He seemed a little concerned about a couple of things.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:42]** You might want to keep tabs on him throughout the ride here.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** Sure.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:43]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:44]** Okay.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:44]** Yep.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** All right.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:48]** They seem like they're really trying to end the conversation at the moment.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:51]** Who's this trust Nick person?

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** Trostenec is the Vesk passenger.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:56]** I thought that you all had met.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:57]** Maybe you didn't.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** I don't know.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:02]** So Trostenec, I think, is in the cargo hold.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** He went over to the cargo hold.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** I saw him this morning.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** He seemed like he was trying to go over there.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** I told you.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:11]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:14]** How would one get to the cargo hold, son?

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** Uh, it's over this way.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:20]** Points down to the starboard right side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:28]** Nico's gonna kind of hit the... He's gonna kind of roll his knuckles on the side of the door.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:32]** He's gonna roll his knuckles on the side of the door for Hears.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:35]** It's kind of like, yo, get the fuck out.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:37]** So, Hears, what are you doing inside the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:43]** Well, can I not, like, look at the note in this 20 seconds or so that this is happening, or...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** Yeah.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:47]** Well, so during that time that you were taking 20, you did open the note.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:49]** It looked like it was written in VESC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:55]** So a take 20 is instead of rolling a dice, there's a take 10 and a take 20.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:58]** I'll have to read up again about what it means fully.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:02]** But a take 20 means that you succeed, but it takes 20 minutes to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:03]** Right, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:08]** Where a take 10 is you take 10 minutes and you can roll for half the DC or something like that.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:13]** It's all on page 133, I think, of the Core Rulebook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:16]** But I haven't opened this package yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:19]** Yeah, so you're standing there.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** They started to walk outside as this happens.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:27]** You hear them talking, and you are holding this gift package with a note that says, from your loving wife.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** And that's kind of just written in common.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** And then there's a folded note.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** You open the note quickly.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:34]** You look.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:37]** You see that it is in Vesk.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** So what do you want to do?

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:42]** You hear Nico rubbing his knuckles on the door.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** Rolling his knuckles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:47]** So there's also an object, right?

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** So like a wrapped object.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:53]** So here's pockets, that wrapped object and takes the note in Vesk.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** Okay.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:56]** Well, he takes everything because he might as well at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:56]** Okay.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:59]** So, so fucking rapid.

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** Okay.

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:01]** And then what do you do with the suitcase?

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:06]** He zips it back up and then proceeds to walk out.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** Puts it back in its place.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:08]** Okay.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:08]** All right.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** So you walk out.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:11]** Dr.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:13]** O.K., you're up there talking with Song.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** Song is talking to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:16]** I'm trying to distract Song.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:20]** Where exactly is this cargo hold?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:26]** So he turns to the left, right, and says, it's actually right down there.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** How would I get there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:32]** Is there a corridor that I follow or stairs I take or –


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** Yeah, just go ahead and turn around the corner.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:41]** There are two cargo holds, but I think he's in the, he said he was going to do some work or something.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** I think he's in the right one.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:43]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:47]** It's not next to the gymnasium, obviously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** It's past the gymnasium, actually.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** You start walking.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:52]** Oh, I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:53]** You get past it.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:54]** Thank you so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:55 - 00:43:01]** I'll say that even in the dim light, even with all that, they say, is everything okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** The power's out.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Yeah.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:07]** Okay.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:11]** And Nico's going to roll back and call back over his shoulder.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** Just make sure you keep close tabs on the professor over there.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** He didn't look too good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** Doctor, okay.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:20]** Nico, give me a... Bluff check?

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:20]** For what?

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Yeah.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:25]** Why are they bluffing?

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:32]** So you're bluffing because you all walked out of Trost's next room.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:34]** I didn't go in it.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:37]** That's true, but then you started walking forward.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:45]** They can see you coming down the hallway, so then you decided to move forward, talk to them, trying to distract them from what was really going on, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:51]** So this is a bluff check to see whether... I rolled a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** You rolled a 17.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** Nico, what did you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** That's a 12 plus 6.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** That's an 18 for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:55 - 00:44:02]** They don't seem to be suspicious at all, or if they are, they aren't showing it, and they likely don't care.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:09]** You can tell from the tone of the past couple of remarks from them that they seem to be very busy and they want to keep moving on.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:16]** So they probably started talking to you out of common courtesy and possibly even just to make sure that everything was all right with the passengers, right?

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:19]** Song is just, like, busy and is like, all right, great, thanks.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** I just meant to ask you.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** No need to keep talking further.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:24]** How are you getting along without powers, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:54]** you know I'm doing alright hopefully it'll kind of come up here soon we'll see have you seen the goblins since the power's gone out nope I have not and frankly I don't want to see them anymore I'd be happy if I didn't ever see them again on this trip but again I want to serve them that stays between you and me obviously well I'm glad you're back to fighting your own battles so let's carry on gents you know Mika's gonna laugh

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:57]** I'm going to remember that, Doctor, okay?

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:59]** I'm sorry for busting your chops.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** Okay.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** All right.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:01]** All right.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:01]** It's over there.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** Take care, y'all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** Thanks for the salt on my food last night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:07]** Nico's going to laugh.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:09]** He's like, I didn't put salt on your food.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** I did not put salt on your food.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:14]** To be fair, there was food there that was not salted.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** That was totally fine.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** But maybe tonight there will be some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:22]** That sounds like a threat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** That sounds like someone being salty.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:26]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:33]** That sounds like someone being salty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:35]** Well done, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:38]** Can't believe no one else got to that one.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:42]** You all start walking down the hall.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** You pass door after door.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** You pass some

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** Ladders going up and down.

**[00:45:50 - 00:46:01]** At the far end of the hall, maybe 80, 20 feet, you see that the hallway curves off to the right.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:11]** And as it starts to curve off to the right, you see it kind of curves at a 45 degree and then comes back straight dead ends.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:17]** And there are two sets of doors, one further ahead, maybe what is that?

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** 40, 30 feet ahead.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:21]** And then one right around the corner as you walked in.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:22]** What do you all do?

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:48]** what's around this corner uh the wall comes together there that's the end there's no there's like no corner there yeah it's like the front of the ship south here's we'll listen in on the door he goes gonna take his both of his blasters out and he's gonna he's gonna look over at here's gonna be like we want to knock on the door what do we want to be doing here

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:51]** I'm trying to listen, but I rolled a six.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:54]** The front of the ship seems like it is.

**[00:46:56 - 00:47:00]** That seems like more towards the front of the ship is where you are now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:00]** I see.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:03]** Well, let's take a look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:06]** Are both of these sets of doors, do they look like they go to the same place?

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:10]** So it's two doors to the same cargo bay.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** You would presume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:11]** Yes.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** Here's you rolled a six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:15]** Yes.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:17]** For what?

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** What did you roll?

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** I'm trying to listen at the door.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:25]** Rick is going to roll for stealth to open this door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** I will do the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:30]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:33]** So, Rick, you're going to open the door that's further south.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Hears was listening at the door.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** Didn't hear anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:38]** I don't know if you heard, but I have my gun out.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** I just want to clarify that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** I'm going to take my gun out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:49]** And, Nico, you also pulled your pistols out, right?

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:49]** Yeah.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:51]** Okay.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:51]** And, Dr.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:55]** O.K., you pulled out your gun, and you're also stealthily opening the door?

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:56]** The door to the north?

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:58]** I attempted a stealth check.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:00]** However, I rolled a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:01]** Seven.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** Rick, what did you roll on your cell chart?

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** 17.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:06]** 17.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** Interesting.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** 10.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** Let's do this.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:13]** Nine, eight, five, four.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:15]** What?

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:15]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:15]** Nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** Open.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** Are we going to coordinate it to open?

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Should we do that?

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** Are you trying to coordinate it open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:22]** Breach.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** Breach.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:24]** Boom.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:24]** Boom.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** Flashbang.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:25]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** We're playing Rainbow Six, guys, next time.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** Yeah, this is actually Rainbow Six.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:33]** An actual play of a Rainbow Six campaign.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:33]** Surprise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:36]** We're role-playing in the role-play game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** Yes, exactly.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** This is good.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** This is good.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:41]** This is great.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:46]** So you all have... You all have talked to the professor.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:50]** You have broken into Trostenec's room.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** You have stolen some of Trostenec's stuff.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:54]** We... You talked to someone.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** We... Stole...

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:58]** You have, now I, you, royal you.

**[00:48:59 - 00:48:59]** I never heard that term.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** It's a good term.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:08]** And now you are going to investigate cargo room.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** Both doors open.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:17]** And in the middle of this cargo bay, pretty vast, probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Pretty fesk, is that what you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:19]** Fast.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:25]** Probably like 60 feet by, you know, the whole length of the hallway that you were walking.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:33]** You can see large crates and some smaller barrels around it scattered throughout.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** Probably some extra luggage that people didn't bring on.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:40]** Maybe some supplies, some containers, general cargo.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:46]** But the one thing to note is that in the middle of the room...

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:57]** You see Trostnik sprawled, unconscious, face bruised amid the shipping containers.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:14]** There's a robot that looks like a humanoid wearing over padded armor that stands near a large open crate nearby and the lights surrounding its cardioid shaped face glow an ominous red as it scans the hold.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** That's our game.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** Got him.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Hi, everyone.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** It's Nick Belcher.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:27]** I play Nico Orion on the Will Save podcast.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:38]** I just want to mention for all our listeners that it's perfectly normal from time to time to feel a little frustrated playing tabletop role-playing games, whether it's the dice not going in your favor.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** Oh, that's four.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:43]** All right, I'm not using that dice set next time.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:46]** Or the story's not going in your favor.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** It's okay to feel a little frustrated.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:54]** At the end of the day, tabletop role-playing games are all about friendship.

**[00:50:55 - 00:51:09]** So long as everyone are still friends at the end of the day, everyone will always laugh with you about that time you got frustrated for rolling a four on an attack roll that saved your friend's life.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:21]** With that being said, everyone stay safe, stay healthy, and tune in next week to find out what happens next time on Will Save.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:49]** Thank you.
