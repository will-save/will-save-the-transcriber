**[00:00:00 - 00:00:10]** Last time on We'll Save... An innocent vice becomes a vulnerable point of blackmail as Lozu reveals her gambling debts to the group.

**[00:00:11 - 00:00:20]** After leaving Lozu to attend to matters on the bridge, our group of adventurers using the map of the Chimera return to Algiada's room for more clues.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:24]** What they discover is troubling.

**[00:00:24 - 00:00:33]** A ventilation grate shows signs of recent use while the group discovers Algiata and Trostnick's relationship before getting on the Chimera.

**[00:00:34 - 00:00:42]** Upon learning these revelations, the group seeks to investigate the engine room when Hears and Nico hear a clatter from the darkness from the room beyond.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:44]** Are our heroes alone?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:48]** Find out this time on We'll Save You.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:44]** When it comes to what type of person you are, here's a question.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** What type of birthday person are you?

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:53]** Because we found out recently that a lot of us have birthdays in May or right around May.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:57]** A particular one that we will say is tomorrow.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** And that is Mr. Kevin Decker!

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:03]** Yeah, it's a big one too.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:05]** Yeah, so what kind of a birthday person are you?

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** Are you like, oh, I don't like birthdays.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** I don't ever want to celebrate them.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** I don't like to feel older.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:12]** Or like I only want socks or my whole month is my birthday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** Do you have a birthday week like my wife?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** No, I celebrate.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:23]** So my birthday is all about gathering the troops for a good time.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:32]** So I will gladly, like one birthday party before COVID was a thing, was at, what's it called now?

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** That place in downtown LA.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** The Edison?


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** No, the game place.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** 84?

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:40]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** Oh, the arcade place.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** Yeah, the circus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** What's it called?

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:46]** Two-Bit Circus.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** Two-Bit Circus.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:48]** Thank you.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** My brain's like short-circuiting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** Two-Bit Circus.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** No, it's in downtown LA.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:53]** Arts District.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** Arts District, yeah.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:55]** It's great.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** But that's where I had one of my birthday parties.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:00]** This coming year, I turn 35.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** It's a big one.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** I don't know.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** I don't have plans for it yet.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** Should probably make those up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Yeah, because it is tomorrow.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:08]** That's fine.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** Yeah.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:09]** Yeah.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** You'll think of something.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:11]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Two-Bit Circus.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** So join me at Two-Bit Circus.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:13]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Just everyone come out to Two-Bit Circus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** If you haven't been to Two-Bit Circus, it's a lot of fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:18]** I want to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:20]** I feel like... Okay, there it is.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** Done.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:21]** Two-Bit Circus.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** That sounds cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** Done.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:23]** It is.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** Yeah, that's good.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:24]** That's good.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:30]** Yeah, I feel like, you know, when you're that kind of a birthday person who's just like, I don't really want to do too much.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:34]** Then sometimes it just passes you by and then you're like, I should have done something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:34]** You know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** It's important.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** It's important to celebrate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** I had one birthday party.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** I used to do Dave and Buster's.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** It was a big thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** For the specials, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:49]** I would do Chuck E. Cheese, but then it gets a little weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:53]** We talked about Chuck E. Cheese already a long time ago, like episode two or three.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:56]** And Nick gave us some information about their pizza.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:57]** They serve beer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** Do you secretly want to do a Chuck E. Cheese birthday?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:04]** I mean, if it wasn't socially awkward, I would totally do it.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:29]** i'd go with i mean i'll go i've gone just do the adult version and go to dave and busters there you go yeah busters is garbage oh man here's where like my my my addictions start coming out i for a long time i had an addiction to claw machines and dave busters usually has a giant claw machine did they have a support group for that no no they don't that's tough that's tough

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:33]** I mean, I couldn't walk past a claw machine without spending at least five bucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:36]** That could be classified as an addiction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** But on a positive note, I usually won.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** That's good.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** I was very good.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:40]** Yeah.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:45]** It got to the point where I would just give away the toys to random kids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:48]** Well, that's awesome.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** Yeah, see, you're just using it for good.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:50]** This is good.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** This is not bad.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:51]** This is not bad.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:59]** One time when I was like six, my friend Colin, I don't know where you are now, but I hope you've forgotten about this.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:03]** We celebrated at Discovery Zone, and him and I were like best buds.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:08]** And then they brought out his cake, and I was sitting right next to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** I can do everything on my own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:31]** own and they lit the candles and I was like I can do this on my own and they were like what about the candles and he was like and I blew it out right before him and my mom was like Jonathan what are you doing and then like her mom ran over like Colin's mom ran over I had to like sit at the other end of the table I think we left early

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:33]** For Discovery Zone?

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:36]** For DC, for Discovery Zone.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** Oh, that's a good jingle.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** That feels like a jingle that Nick wrote.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** You're too kind, John.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** You're way too kind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:43]** I can do everything on my own.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:45]** I'm going DC, yeah.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** Discovery Zone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** I kind of want that to be a drop.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** Nick, you were saying?

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** You're way too kind, John.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** You're way too kind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:58]** That I would bestow upon you is such a great... Well, post-pandemic, people don't blow on candles anymore.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** Yeah, right?

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** We've just all realized that that's just gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:04]** It's gross that you're blowing all over everyone's cake that they're going to eat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:09]** Well, or in John's case, you're blowing on your friend's candle and then he blows on it right after.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** Yeah, you know, hey, it was the 90s.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** A lot of things were fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** You know what time it is?

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:19]** It's that time we should probably get on to the adventure.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:22]** Unless Nick had one thing that he was trying to get in under the door here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** No, I was just saying game time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:25]** Game time.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:26]** Let's do it.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:29]** Yeah.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** If I recall.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** What happened?

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** Last week.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** Last week.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:34]** Let's be real.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** What didn't happen last week?

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** Am I right?

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** Am I right?

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:41]** We split the party, but didn't split the party.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:41]** That's true.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:41]** You did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:45]** It's a little bit of a wall, so that's split-ish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** So think about this.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** You all go through.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:50]** You're splitting the party.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:53]** Wait, the party's not split.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** We're flanking a wall.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** You're flanking a wall.

**[00:06:55 - 00:07:00]** Important distinction because you get a flanking bonus when flanking the wall should the wall attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:01]** Yeah.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:04]** And all wall-based attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:07]** All wall-based attacks mostly succeed.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:10]** So, you know, it's going to be a tough fight against the wall.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** I wish you all the best.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** I wish you all the best.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** May your characters live.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** Bet you wish you were flanked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:20]** May the odds ever be in your favor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** You couldn't quite decide what to do.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:24]** Do we keep exploring the map?

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:27]** Do we find some treasure, some relic?

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:30]** Do we go and just try and get a top-down view?

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:33]** Maybe we try and look in on some of the security systems.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:37]** You all were split, much like you're split now.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:42]** And you said, well, let's keep exploring a bit of the map.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:46]** Maybe some of these answers will present themselves along the way.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** You head down.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:50]** You check out the gym.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:54]** Nothing in the water except a good time, really.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** And then you keep going down to the engineering deck.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:15]** You go through Kears and Niko go into one of the technical sections in which there is the drift engine, one of the thruster access areas, a lot of the computers that control some of the systems of the ship.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:24]** Dr. O'Kay and Rick, you all head north a little bit into an area that seems to be mostly computer consoles.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:30]** And at the back, there is a long computer screen.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:40]** And I believe you all were just looking, trying to find any clues, any sense of if there's anything important here whatsoever.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:45]** While Nico and Hears, you were both more intently focused on what's wrong with the ship.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** I want to keep exploring the engineering section.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:55]** And as we jump over to the map here on Roll20, thanks, Roll20, and this great music by Syrinscape.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:56]** Thanks, Syrinscape.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** Thank you.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:01]** Thanks.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** Thank you.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Thanks so much.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:03]** ASMR.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** We love you.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** And Hero Lab.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:06]** Love you.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** We love your maps.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** Great, beautiful maps.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:14]** So amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** There's the sound of something falling.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:26]** Scales, taste the rainbow.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:35]** There's the sound of something falling maybe 20, 30 feet away from here as in Niko in that general area where somebody just clicked and highlighted on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:41]** That was actually the sound waves of the falling body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:43]** Niko in here is what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:46]** Nico's going to turn around.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:53]** He's going to grab his blasters from off the table, wherever he put them down to do his computer's checks.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** Okay.

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:00]** And he's just going to kind of take cover over here next to here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** You want to move your character over?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** Yeah.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** Okay.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:09]** And he's going to roll a perception check, too, just to see if he can figure out where this person is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:12]** Here's tell me what you're doing, and then Nico, tell me your perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:36]** uh here's just shares a look with uh nico and uh has some magic missiles ready and we'll also roll perception your hands kind of start to question are these like how tall are these um computer desks mostly to the ceiling you can't really see too much all right just checking they weren't like half cover that's fine it's okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** Nico, here's what you get on your perception checks.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** I got an eight.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** Fifteen.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:41]** Okay.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** Fifteen, an eight.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** You don't hear anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** Okay.

**[00:10:51 - 00:11:00]** Here's this going to roll stealth and kind of sneak around behind Nico and then kind of go check it out.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** It's a 21.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** You seem pretty stealthy.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** There's no door that's going to give you away.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:07]** You walk around.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** You walk around.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:11]** You peer around this corner.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:16]** There's two kind of little hallways, maybe 20 feet.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Before you get to the wall.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:21]** In the middle one, you walk through.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** You don't see anything.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** And you keep going.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** And you peer around the corner.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:32]** And in the... Farthest hallway closest to the door.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** By the way, Nico's gonna find... There's a little door there.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** All real stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:45]** You see... A... Sort of gold object...

**[00:11:47 - 00:12:13]** looks to be like some sort of design it's intentional maybe like a ship or something it's not too big maybe a foot long if if that it's mounted on a rod that's mounted on a silver square base i got a 14 on that south roll john

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:13]** That's fine.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** You're fine.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:19]** I'm putting it into Kelly and Nick's journal right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** Oh, wow.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** It's a statue.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:25]** You'll see in a sec.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** Yeah, it looks like a little statue.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:32]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** This is all happening right as Dr. O.K.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** and Rick are just starting to kind of walk up.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** Fourteen.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** Eighteen and fourteen.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** Okay.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** We're walking back out?

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** No, no, no.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:50]** Just as you're walking down that little back corridor where it's like a further hallway in the back.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:52]** So just fell just before.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:56]** And you're just starting to kind of walk back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** Sorry, they're doing a perception check on this object?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** Yeah, on the object.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** They picked up this object.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:05]** Wouldn't that be like a history or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** I'm getting there.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:06]** I'm getting there.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** It was just a perception check to see.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** It's got magic buttons or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:15]** So you're always getting ahead of yourself there, Kev.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:39]** am i yeah the nose of this object behind the nose of this object seems to be stained with blood what you all can do a life science or medicine check if you want to see that any further i'm not in there yeah i'm talking to nico and here's uh here's got a 27 you can bring it to dr okay holy cow we won't need to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:43 - 00:14:03]** you say bollocks that i'm gonna re-roll i'm gonna yeah i did i'm gonna re-roll that except that's fine um i'm gonna re-roll it because it's cheater yeah weird no it rolled off the table pumpkin eater it rolled thank you it rolled off the table and then it rolled in my hand


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:06]** It rolled off the table, and it was a natural one.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** Yeah, and then just happened to be a one when it hit and then fell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** Actually, to be honest, it rolled lower the second time.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** It was a 12 the first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:15]** You're training life science or medicine, right, Nick?

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** That's correct.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:25]** This is particularly of interest to you because both of you give me a culture check if you're training culture.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:27]** I am not.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** Nico, are you training culture?

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:30]** I am.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** Give me a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:35]** Well, I came through for you this time.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:35]** It's 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** Nice.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** There you go.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** That is impressive.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:43]** Nico, you know that this is a replica.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:55]** Of the Adari, the massive Kasathan generational starship that orbits the packed worlds between Versys and the Diaspora.

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:03]** So you know that this is the Kasathan home, more or less, here in the packed worlds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:05]** Nico's going to relay this to Heroes.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** He's going to be like, that's strange.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:12]** This looks to be the Kasathan ship here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:14]** Don't forget that Keeve is a Kasathan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:15]** Keeve is not a Kasothan.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:18]** Captain Rameem is Kasothan.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:20]** Magwa, the Kasothan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** No, Keeve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** They are a Marakoi.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Oh, you're right, you're right.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Graff is a Yusoki.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:30]** I can't keep all the alien races straight.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:32]** All you alien races look alike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** That's not what I meant.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Yeah, that's definitely what Kev meant.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** I want to get back to this because this is important.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:41]** Here's this check.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:43]** You can tell that the blood...

**[00:15:44 - 00:16:00]** on this object it seems as if the blood only dried recently maybe less than a day and because you did so well because you did so well

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:06]** You can tell that this blood is from a Kasatha.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:10]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** Can you explain why?

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:15]** Why would he know just by looking at it that it's Kasatha blood?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** Because I rolled so high.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** Yeah, because he rolled really high.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** I can't even explain how great it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** Is it like a color thing?

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** He rolled 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:26]** It's for people who pay attention to, you know...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** would also have been able to figure it out.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** Alien races.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:34]** would also... Calls everybody a rat guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:40]** probably would have been able to figure it out too with your kit.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** So what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:47]** Well, here's... Tells this to Nico.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** He just relays it to him.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:53]** He's like, this is only a day old and it's from a Kasothan, this blood.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:56]** He was hit, I don't know, in the head, something.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** And I think here's is going to look up.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:00]** It's head blood.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** The roll is that high.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** It's head blood.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:07]** Actually, I don't know that.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** Is there a way that here's can figure out where this fell from?

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:13]** Maybe the ceiling event, something like that.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** Sure.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** Give me a perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** Look up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** Fair enough.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:21]** He's going to look around, especially up.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** That's a 12, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:34]** Yeah, it looks like the ceiling, you kind of reach up, and the ceiling grate does seem to kind of move a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:38]** Well, there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** It's at that time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:50]** Well, as Hears was doing that, Nico was going to say to him, well, when all this is over, does it look valuable?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:52 - 00:18:02]** It looks like, I'll tell you this, a quick scan appraisal would tell you that this is mostly made out of plastic polymer.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:06]** It's not really any, it's like gold painted.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** It's 3D printed.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:10]** Yeah, it was 3D printed, as one does in the future.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** Here's Nico.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:18]** I don't want to cut you guys off, but if there's anything else you want to say, I was going to jump over to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** Say now or forever hold our peace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:22]** Yeah, because Dr. O.K.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:27]** and Rick, you're walking up.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:29]** The screen looks interesting.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:34]** Maybe you walk down the corridors, large screen, honestly, like 60 feet.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:40]** And you look against the walls on the far corner.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:45]** And then you walk back to the walls on the corner that you are in front of right now.

**[00:18:47 - 00:19:07]** and can we see like all of this area is clear like that rick would like sure like strafe it and you're talking about the area in the center that's like the little twisting yeah it looks like there's openings here yeah yeah so as you walk through there you do see a lot of twisting hallways and computer stations mostly looked

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:18]** This was why you started to notice that the hallway to the right seemed to be the one where there were a lot of people or where there was a lot of activity, right?

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** The chair seemed to be moved and everything.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** And...

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:41]** as you get up to the wall here you do see this like faint kind of outline of a door and a like some sort of keypad panel

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:46]** Can I investigate it?

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:47]** Yeah.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** You walk up.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:55]** It just looks very impressively sunken into the wall.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:59]** It seems like it was really meant for people to not notice at all.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** I rolled on a nine on perception.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:02]** Nine on perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:06]** I rolled a twenty-three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** Yeah, you all already noticed it.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:16]** You see, you can trace your finger now along the outline of the door, and you can tell this is really not meant for anybody to find at all.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:19]** It seems like it's really intended to be hidden.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:31]** But because of the fact that you all first rolled so well and noticed this area, and then with the map, as you look at it, and you're like, the map is circling this wall, so we're just going to focus on this wall.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** And because of that, you did...

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:36]** feel like this was the best area of interest.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:43]** And as you run your fingers over the keypad, you can tell that the door is locked via the keypad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:46]** This appears to be locked.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:56]** Perhaps we might employ our friend Nico to investigate or bypass.

**[00:20:56 - 00:21:04]** I mean, I have a computer skill, but I feel like he might have more tricks up his sleeve when it comes to gaining access to this panel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** I concur.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:11]** Let's just return to... Should we look around the rest of this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:13]** I have cleared out the other area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** Okay.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** Never gets old.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** So what do you want to do?

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:25]** So you start walking over and then you're going to walk back to Nico and here's, or are you going to keep exploring?

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** Weird.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** God, the way you say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:31]** So I checked all these hallways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** Yeah.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:33]** There's nothing really of any interest over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:36]** We can like enter the same room as them through here, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** You do recall that that leads down a certain hallway.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** Yeah.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** So, yeah, we'll go through that.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** Okay.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:47]** So you guys walk down two double doors that are on the central.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:57]** It's the opposite wall that here's a Nico found the statue, and it leads to another set of double doors at the end, a door on your right and an opening on your left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** Sorry, the door is down here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** Nope.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:04]** This is the door here on the right, and then there's a double door.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:04]** There's two doors straight ahead?

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:10]** Yeah, there's a double door straight ahead, and then the opening on the left is just an opening in the wall.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:18]** And as you walk through, you kind of piece and remember maybe this is where the incinerator is, right?

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:23]** This is where you guys came to drop off the bugs, the asteroid lice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:26]** Rick's going to step out into the hall and roll perception.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:26]** Okay.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:26]** Okay.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:31]** 19 plus 5 is a 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:34]** You don't see anything in this hallway.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** Even on the ceilings?

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:39]** Nope, you don't see anything on the ceilings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:41]** Mirrors on the ceilings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:44]** You don't hear anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** No champagne on ice.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** Champagne on ice?

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** No, you don't.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:52]** Well, it's because we're all just prisoners here of our own demise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** That's exactly why.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** That's why.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:55]** That's why.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** This is just Hotel California.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:02]** No, you don't see anything over here or hear anything at all.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:06]** You do actually come to think of it.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:10]** You do hear something with a high perception like that.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** Very faintly.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:17]** You hear like, then it stops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** From what direction?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:23]** Coming from further over this way.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** Over here?

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:31]** Yeah, further to the left past some of these little sit-down computer consoles and past the incinerator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:34]** I'll inform Doctor, okay.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:37]** I hear something over that direction.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:40]** A mechanical tinging noise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:45]** Perhaps something has been knocked loose and is...

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:47]** Who knows?

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:51]** I don't know how these contraptions work.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** It's not like I'm an engineer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:54]** I only know how bodies work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:04]** I only know how you bipedal organisms make whatever you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** Here's a Niko.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:07]** What are you all doing as you're standing there?

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:10]** What are your thoughts of what you should do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:19]** Niko's looking over at Here's and he's just like... And he wants to do a full sweep of the room again here with Here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:20]** Dr.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** O.K.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:23]** 's going to pop in to the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:30]** I'm going to roll a stealth check again just to make sure that we're not alerting anybody who put that there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** Okay.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:41]** He thinks that whatever it is is still up in the vents, but he is going to look around and roll stealth.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** That's 19.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:42]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:43]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:44]** is going to just burst in.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:47]** Nico, what did you get on stealth?

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:47]** 22.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** 22?

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:51]** Yeah, so both of you are trying to be stealthy, and Dr. O.K.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** comes in.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:53]** Hey, how are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Hey, guys.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:59]** Yeah, so... Quick question.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:03]** Do you want to help me break into something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:03]** Dr.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** O.K.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:10]** 's stuffling opens the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** Classic.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:14]** Nico turns sharply and looks over at Dr. K. Shh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** Shh.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** Quiet.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:18]** Quiet.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:19]** Sorry.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:24]** Would you like to help me break into something?

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** Get in here first.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:25]** Get in here.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** What?

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:27]** Why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Bring the robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:53]** not a robot but but why i gotta show you something okay i'll hey hey hey rick uh they want us to see something first i don't think it's interesting but maybe it is so you all show them maybe it's this golden model with blood on it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:57]** So you all... Here, I'll put it in all of your journals.

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** And then I'll show it to the players.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** That looks weird.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:03]** You see it?

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** On the screen, too.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** Is it a statue?

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:09]** Yeah, it's a statue of the Adari with blood on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:12]** Did you say the Kasothans live on it?

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** Like, this is like the home planet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:17]** Yeah, so quick little lore for people who don't know.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:21]** Kasothans came and I believe tried to... They...

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:43]** left and fled their their planet they have a very traditionalist society and they fled their planet uh i forget why but they traveled and they landed in the packed worlds and they said well we're going to take over i think it's aquiton and then they realized that the packed worlds has this whole system and they were like this is probably not in our best interest so the packed worlds um

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:55]** accepted them and said, well, your ship is literally like a generational sized ship that is meant to travel long distances and carry life and, you know, contain the seed of the Kasathan people.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:02]** And so they let the Adari stay in the system and kind of made it part of the pack worlds.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** And that's how Kasathans came in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:11]** So most Kasathans are by now, they might be born somewhere else for sure, but that is their home.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** That's the only home that they know.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:29]** So, here's us going to, like, kind of, say, quietly whisper and, like, point at the vent and be like, it came out of there, dropped down, and this has Kasatan blood on it.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:32]** I think it's from the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:39]** Could I do, like, a life science check?

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:39]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:44]** Yeah, you're probably not going to find out anything more than what you already know.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** That's the blood from a cassava.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:47]** Recall knowledge, though.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:53]** I would be able to, like... I did administer health to Captain Rameem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:55]** True.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:59]** But I don't know that you took Captain Rameem's blood.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** I did.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** I believe.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** I mean, I injected him.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** But you didn't take his blood out.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:08]** I'm not trying to say no.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:14]** I'm just trying to say that I don't think you have a vial of Captain Rameem's blood in particular.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:14]** Okay.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** You can just taste it.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** Yeah, just taste it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:22]** My custom micro lab just does things on its own, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Yeah, clearly.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** I'm super sorry.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:28]** I didn't realize that your micro lab bent the rules to Starfinder.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** My bad.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:32]** Yeah, that was totally my bad.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:34]** It's in the character operations manual, please.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** You're right.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:38]** Biohackers, custom micro labs can bend the rules.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:38]** Yep.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Thanks, Paizo.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:41]** Yeah, thanks, Paizo.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** That was good.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** So what do you all want to do?

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** You have this weapon.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** There's some sort of secret door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:51]** Rick starts shooting all the vents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:56]** Can we seal these vents without shooting him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:56]** No.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:02]** Nico's going to roll a perception check to see if he sees anything on his sweep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** Okay.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** Same, same.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** Let me know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:11]** That's a 13 on my perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:20]** Now that Rick's in the room, he'll look up at the vent and there's an investigate, right?

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:20]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** It's just perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** So I'll roll perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:26]** I'll tell you all that you don't see anything else in the room on your switch.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** Are you on a natural 20?

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** No.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** You don't see anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:34]** Is it bright enough to see if something was up there?

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** Could we tell that there's nothing no longer looking at us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:40]** You can use survival to either find tracks or follow tracks you have found for one mile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** You can use survival then if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** I will roll survival.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:45]** It's still emergency lighting down here.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:54]** There's a bit more lighting from some of the computer screens, but you don't see anything in particular from just standing there and looking up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** I have a 12.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:59]** Rick will say... You don't see any tracks.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:04]** Does somebody want to give me a boost so I can look further into the ventilation system?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:10]** Nico will help him do that, but he also will cast dancing lights.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:12]** He's going to throw some lights up there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:13]** Nice.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** Cantrip.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** Um...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:26]** yeah that's all uh rick is gonna put away his or he's gonna set down his artillery laser and pull out his pistol rick kind of gives him a boost i mean here he's giving him a boost


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:34]** And cast lights to kind of go upside Rick's head as he goes up into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** Okay.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:36]** Interesting.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:40]** Yeah, you don't see much of anything.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:47]** It seems like this vent in particular, as you put yourself above...

**[00:30:47 - 00:31:05]** the finished ceiling there you do see a lot of ducks seems like they're some of the walls go above the ceiling so there's not too much space in here um but from what you can make from the dancing lights and the eerie changing multicolored lights that are kind of painting everything

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:11]** You can tell that this vent in particular and maybe a couple others that are throughout don't have any bolts in them.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:16]** They just can be pushed up and kind of moved over.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** That's not uncommon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:19]** They should have bolts?

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** Like the bolts are removed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:26]** You would think that they would in the engineering section, that maybe there would be something securing them there, but there aren't any bolts there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:30]** Like, this is suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** Literally among us.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:39]** Like, there are little places where there could have been bolts, and there are, like, you know, not any in there.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:41]** Impostors hiding in the vents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Can I reach any of them?

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:46]** Can I, like, put my arm forward and push one up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** Yeah, I thought that you were going up there.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** You're looking up there, right?

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:51]** You're looking around at the vent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** I was just going to stick my head in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** Yeah, and then that's what you see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:59]** I know, but can I reach forward and then push up on another panel?

**[00:31:59 - 00:31:59]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:09]** Or are you saying... No, it's just this great area seems like it should have had bolts and then didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:12]** Weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:16]** Yeah, I'll relay that down to everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:19]** Hey, let's go break into this panel back there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:25]** Are you not concerned about this bloodied statue?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:28]** Well, they're dead, maybe.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** Whoever left it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:33]** That is the concern.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:35]** Maybe they hid the body in a panel.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:44]** I suggest we clear all the other rooms before we go into that locked room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** Did you find anything up there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** We found a door.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:56]** We found a door in the wall that is possibly trying to be hidden, but it has a keypad.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:00]** Possibly one of you may override it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** Yeah.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:04]** Nico, I think you might be well-suited for something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:06]** Doctor, okay.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:11]** Are either you or Rick trained in engineering?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:11]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:16]** I'd like you to come over and take a look at something real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Sure.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:21]** And he's going to walk back over to the computer system he was at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:24]** Okay.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** Okay.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** Fascinating computer.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** What would you like me to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:39]** Nico is going to look over at Dr. Okay, and he's just going to say, this system is telling me that there are some things wrong with the drift engine.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:42]** However, there is a cascade of other issues as well.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:44]** I can't get it quickly.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** I know I can crack it in the long run.

**[00:33:46 - 00:34:01]** I wanted to get the feeling, though, that I get the feeling, though, that if we spent some time in this room, we might be able to collect a lot of information about who the perpetrator is without risking further exposure, risking the fact that we may or may not be onto them.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:05]** We might even find a way to solve some of these issues and get the engines back online.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:06]** You think it's worth it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:15]** I think we have higher concerns, like the creature in the ductwork or the door that we found.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Indeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Something's here right now.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:25]** That being said, the best thing we can do to force their hand is to give them a timetable.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** Right now, that person has none.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** That individual has no timetable.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:34]** They have all the time in the world to accomplish their goals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** I see.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:40]** So that restoring power would upset their plans, you think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:45]** I mean, they wanted the engines off for a good reason.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:48]** We accelerate their timetable, they might grow careless, might flush them out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:57]** If we put our heads together and get that done, how quickly can you get up the engines then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** We don't even know where to begin.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:06]** We would probably need Keev or someone else on the ship to get something running like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:10]** Yeah, you would know that it's taking a day, per se.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:14]** It's a pretty extensive fix, from what you know, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:15]** Okay.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:22]** I don't think that... I don't know that we can... I mean, if we have to, we will.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** But...

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:34]** I think it's better to find out what's going on and restore order to its natural order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:42]** John, would I know whether or not there's a way for me to restore basic power to the ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:44]** You could probably suss out an issue.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** Yeah.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:52]** You could probably suss out a way to make basic power come back, but just to like restore lights maybe.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** Right.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:57]** But not necessarily to get like the drift engine and everything back up and running.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:07]** No, no, no, not the drift engine, but to restore lights and possibly gain a little bit more knowledge or control of the security cameras or something like that, or control of security cameras in this area.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:13]** You can't control them from here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:29]** I think it's important to realize that if this perpetrator is able to go through the vents and carry out any number of heinous acts, that security cameras...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:42]** There's a distinct possibility I'm looking to try to catch this guy in the act, not necessarily track him down just as he's completing their objective.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:45]** Oh, man, this is turning into a big game of Among Us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:51]** There's no security cameras in the quarters where... I saw a blue vent!

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:53]** Emergency meeting.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:55]** I was at the security system.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:58]** Nico's the imposter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** I was in the security room.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:01]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:05]** So what do you guys want to do?

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:07]** It's an interesting thought.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** I thought I might be able to get something out of it.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:11]** Doctor, okay.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** What was it that you wanted me to take a look at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:17]** There is a door that has a security lock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** Let's take a look at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:24]** Perhaps there's a secret entrance to another room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** We could certainly take a look at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** Can we check for booby traps and stuff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:32]** Sure.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:33]** Yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** Roll perceptions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** Fucking natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** Wow.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:42]** Yeah, nothing that seems to be a trap here.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** Not like last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:48]** Well, I think there's no trap, but maybe there is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** Well, what was your total roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** My total roll is perception?

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:53]** 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** Yeah, no, there's no traps.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:58]** You're pretty confident.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** You did an incredibly thorough search.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:05]** I've searched every morsel of this area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** Rick is standing guard in the back.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** He's got his artillery laser back out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:19]** Here's is going to try to hack it, probably with Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:23]** Nico's hacking.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:27]** Either give me an engineering or a computer's check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** Sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:30]** 29.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:32]** 19 to assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** 27.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:39]** Okay, 27 and what, 29?

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** Here's rolling high.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** Yeah, it's impressive.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** It's impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:48]** And I assisted successfully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:51]** And that was computers or engineering or both?

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:54]** Computers.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:54]** Okay.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:56]** You guys hack in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** Do-do-do-do-do-do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:03]** There's like this really long AOL dial-up thing.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** And give me a second.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:09]** Welcome to Chimera Online.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:18]** Welcome to the Chimera Public Access Terminal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:21]** Does anybody remember the old AOL dial-up?

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** Oh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:26]** Oh, how it haunted my dreams.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** Except I never had AOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:33]** I thought I was going to get just left hanging in the cold on that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** No way.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:39]** I was a Netcom and Earthlink guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** Netcom and Earthlink.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** Wow.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** So good.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:43]** Okay.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** I'm going to do something here.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** Reveal the map.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:49]** It's a room full of treasure.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Barquests.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:56]** It's a secret Barquests club where only Barquests are allowed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** All the eggs for the Barquests.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Great.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:02]** Fascinating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** Does anyone have a grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:03]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** I know that you guys are.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:08]** So I'm going to move you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** I will actually prime my grenade.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:10]** Okay.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** I'll hang on to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:14]** Okay.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** You're just going to hold it.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:17]** Pull the pin and walk around with it.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:20]** Just going to pry my grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** Just hold it ready to go.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:25]** That's so funny.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** Just in case.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** That's so funny.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** That's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:34]** There is a feat, I think, that is like cook a grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** You can cook a grenade.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:35]** Yeah.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:36]** So here's the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:39]** Picture this.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** If you say next episode.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** What?

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:43]** What?

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** Don't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:44]** Don't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** Don't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:47 - 00:41:06]** What you see is a door that the faint outline just slides back and then slides over to the right.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:19]** As you step in to this room, automatic lights click on inside a room beyond the open secret door.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** Hold on.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** Hold on.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:27]** Revealing a cargo hold full of dusty boxes.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:32]** Netting hangs from the ceiling.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:39]** And there are a few objects, tools, maybe weapons, things lying around leaning against the walls, against some of the boxes.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:48]** But when, as you look in, it seems to be maybe, I don't know, what is this?

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** 60 by 40 feet wide.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:56]** There's one large area in the center.

**[00:41:57 - 00:42:00]** That seems to be some sort of a pillar.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:02]** Like an obelisk?

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:04]** Like some sort of an obelisk.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:12]** It seems like it's, you know, like a structural... Is it actually in... No, it seems like a structural part of the ship.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:12]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:13]** Yeah.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** Like a strut.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:18]** Um, yeah, like a, sure.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** A strut or column.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** Thank you for the synonyms.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:27]** It seems like some, something in the center is just a solid, big column.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:35]** And then all these crates nearby, but the most interesting thing, and this is where I'm going to move you.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:38]** I know not all of you are in the right space, but I'm going to move you over.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:42]** The most interesting thing is that as you look past the column,

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:55]** There's the form of a male Kasatha lying in the center of the room, arms twisted in painful positions and one of their shoes missing.

**[00:42:55 - 00:43:00]** And there's a puddle of blood dried under their head.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:05]** I'm going to roll perception to see if that's the captain's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** I rolled 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** 23, 21.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** 19.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:09]** 21.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:11]** Okay.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:17]** You are fairly certain that that's the captain's body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** Is there anything else around him?

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Fuck.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:24]** Is there a trap of some sort?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** No, there's nothing.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** Can I see him?

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** You guys can move in.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** There was no trap on the door that you can see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** No, don't go in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:35]** I don't see the thing.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** That's fine.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** Could we see a relic, perhaps?

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** Is it here where I'm moving in?

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** Yeah, did I?

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:42]** Oh, I see.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:43]** Oh, that's why.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** It's because of this thing.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** I'll cut that out.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:46]** No wonder.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:49]** No wonder there was no exclamation of, like, what the hell.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** That's what you see.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:52]** Oh, no!

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** That sucks.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** That looks bad.

**[00:43:56 - 00:44:00]** You are fairly certain that that is the body of the captain.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:03]** No, there doesn't seem to be anything by it.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:05]** Doesn't seem to be any sort of trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:10]** Okay, so I'm going to roll perception on the body with my life science check.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** Is he alive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** Just do either medicine or perception, whichever one you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** I'll do medicine.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** That was...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:49]** 19 19 okay there's a blow to the back of his head having seen the instrument the statue from before it seems like that is some sort of a murder weapon nico's he dead he's dead nico's gonna look over at here's and he's gonna be like this happened recently we heard that clatter and we we saw that statue


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:53]** Yeah, no less than an hour ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** I'm going to search for weapons now.

**[00:44:56 - 00:45:01]** Here's just going to look for more vents or any signs of anything else kind of creeping around in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** Okay, everyone give me a perception check.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** Nico's also going to start walking over to Rick as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** I rolled an 11.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** I rolled a 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:14]** 11, 5, 20.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:14]** 27.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** That is what I was looking for, Dr. Okay.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:23]** Because as you start to walk over, you look over at that center structural element.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** It seems to be some sort of a pillar.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:33]** And Dr. Okay, you realize that that is some sort of a

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:37]** There's like another faint outline of a door there.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:45]** And there's another keypad faintly into there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:47]** Nico, are there any open vents or anything on the ceiling you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** No, there are.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:53]** Yes, but none look like they're twisted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** Are any of them missing screws like they were?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** You would need to go up and look.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** Do you want to look?

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** I'll say that if you want to look, you can go look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** He's ready to help hack something.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:06]** Okay.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** Go ahead, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:17]** Nico's walking over to Rick, and he's going to say, this furthers my suspicions about our little Yusuke friend, Grath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** Mine too.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** He is now a suspect on my list.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:27]** Nico looks troubled and waiting for other reactions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:30]** Want to take a look inside this giant pillar?


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:30]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:33]** I would like to secure the room first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** Mika starts chuckling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:49]** So, Rick, I'll say that if you want to get up and maybe you take a couple crates, move them, stand and push up one of the crates at the top, it seems like it's similar.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:53]** Maybe you do it to one or two and you realize none of them have screws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** Yeah, like they're all loose.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** Like somebody's using this as a travel path.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** What do you guys want to do now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:04]** Nico's going to ask Dr. Okay about the thing here, but Kev, what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** I want to inspect that.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:13]** I want to be able to get up into that area and see if there's any trails of something moving around up there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** Okay.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** Go ahead.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:18]** Yeah, so I'm going to say that you probably are able to get up there.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** You want to give me a perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** Perception or survival?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** Survival is fine.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:23]** That's fine.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:24]** Natural 20.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:25]** Natural 20.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** You don't see any trails.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** You don't see any of that same residue that's in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:34]** Is there any pathway to another area?

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Like, this is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:38]** Some of the vents do go up.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** The vents can go up.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:46]** They clearly connect to other parts of the ship, but you don't see any residue there, per se.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** I'm torn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:54]** wanted to know also what weapons were in here.

**[00:47:55 - 00:48:05]** Is this somebody's illicit storage locker, or is it like... What can I suss about this room in general from my perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:09]** It seems like a room that is meant to not be found.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:18]** And it seems like it has some things in here that, yeah, maybe you wouldn't keep in the general cargo holds of the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:20]** Um, here's one to help armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:42]** get into no not necessarily any armor per se but uh you said what kind of weapons there were some weapons as you look over um you do see that there is there are two tactical dueling swords that are just kind of sitting around what yep


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:42 - 00:49:05]** oh god i gotta have one of those yeah nico's gonna have one too yeah yeah i think here's should definitely have a a fucking lance for a space cavalier so pirate exactly yep it completes the look i quite agree do you guys have like melee abilities yep basic melee proficiency yeah yeah for sure


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:09]** I've got a plus four to hit on melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** All right, look, I'm a pirate.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** I've got to have one of these swords.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** What else are you guys doing?

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:21]** So we're going to try to see if we can't break into this illicit locker.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:23]** Or at least I'm there with Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:25]** I'll help, but I want to quickly check the body.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:28]** Perhaps it's a vault full of gold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:32]** So you all are going to the secret door panel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:38]** I suggest we shut the door behind us and secure this room before we open that vault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:41]** Yeah, just wait one second.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:43]** Let me check this body real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** Oh, God.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:49]** Captain Rameem, have any good weapons on him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** You are checking Captain Rameem's body.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** I am, but I only rolled a 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:56]** Anybody want to help?

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** I rolled a 20.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:59]** Yeah, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:05]** We were able to ascertain the cause of death, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:06]** Yeah.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:12]** You could tell that several blows to the back of the head killed him from some of the head wounds.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** There's nothing on this person.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:16]** So hold on one sec.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:24]** So you did see that based on how much blood is here, the captain wasn't killed here.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:29]** The captain was killed somewhere else and brought to here afterwards.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** Was there a blood trail in the vents?

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** There was not a blood trail in the vents.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:50]** And you can tell that, again, the captain, based on the dry blood from the Adari statue and then from looking here, the captain probably died during last night, during the first night of the drift.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:52]** And you can tell that this is the murder weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:54]** I mean, we just saw the captain in the last three hours.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:54]** Yeah.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:59]** It wasn't that long after we left the bridge that we came down here.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:06]** It's not like we spent 20 hours up there talking to Lozo.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** Not to mess up your timeline, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:20]** I think it was last episode that I said something to the effect of everything that you see or that I tell you or that you've heard has a reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** Oh, shit!

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:23]** The captain's not the captain!

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** Fuck!

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:26]** Sorry.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:29]** This game really is messing with my head, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:31]** This is the most creeped out I've ever been.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:34]** I haven't genuinely been creeped out until now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:39]** This is the most giddy slash upset and terrified I've ever seen Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:43]** Yeah, this is... This is just the start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:46]** I've been on edge this entire game.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** He's wired to 11 right now.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** Dr. Okay, and...

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:56]** You notice that the captain doesn't have anything on their body.

**[00:51:56 - 00:52:08]** If you want to keep looking further to look into the crates and containers and things that aren't just out, that's going to take a bit of time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:14]** Do we want to search the rest of the containers before opening door number three?

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:16]** I think I'd rather open the door first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:17]** I think so, too.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:20]** So Rick wants us to go shut this door here.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:21]** Okay.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:23]** Is there a way to open it from inside?

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:23]** I'm sure there is.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** Yeah, you can shut it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:25]** Shh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** Okay.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** And there's no other doors in this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:30]** There's the door that is in that.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** So far, with the perception check that Dr. O.K.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:40]** did, which was pretty great, I think it was 27, the only door that you found was the one in the center structural area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:47]** Yeah, so we entered here, there's another one on that pillar, and there's the only two entrances in the room besides the panels on the roof.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:51]** So wherever the door is for this pillar, it's on this side, you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** No, the other side.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** It's up here?

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:54 - 00:53:04]** So Rick is going to go move into a tactical position to where he has a view of that door, but he also has a view of the roof panels.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** Actually, probably over this way.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:11]** And he's just going to sit ready with this artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** Okay, so who is going to open the door?

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:15]** I'm just going to have some drugs ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** Drugs ready?

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:16]** Okay.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** Magic missiles ready.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:20]** Magic missiles ready, drugs ready, guns ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:23]** But we need Nico to bypass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:28]** So Nico's going to put away one of his blasters so that he can try to bypass with one hand here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** And I will assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:33]** Rick is going to note to everybody that he's concerned.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:39]** And he tells you as soon as Dr. Okay or whoever said it said he's been dead for a day.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:45]** Rick is going to state, we saw the captain less than three hours ago.

**[00:53:45 - 00:54:06]** and my other my other thing i really want to say is that like the i don't think it's a bar cast then because we know bar cast can shape shift into two that it's not like a bar cast would either eat it to get stronger or like it can only shape a shift into two things so like it's not a bar cast that is taking the form of the captain but the captain that we saw is not the captain

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:11]** And he wants to just make sure that everybody hears that.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** Like, this is a big deal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** What if this is not the captain?

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:18]** Fucked a lot of them.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** Uh... Dr.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:25]** O.K., do you want to... I think, based on your previous medicine check, if you wanted to follow up with that, you could.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:26]** Yeah, could I?

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:30]** Give me another medicine check, Dr. O.K.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** Go ahead.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** I got a 24.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** 24.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:40]** You can tell that this is not any sort of facsimile of a captain.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:42]** This is the real captain.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:44]** Based on the genetic markers looking at the blood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:47]** This is the genuine captain, just so we're clear.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:56]** His body must have been disposed here to hide the fact that he has been taken by some doppelganger.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** I don't know.

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:08]** Could I do a life science check to figure out what creatures might be able to assume his form as well as be compressible in a ventilation shaft?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:11]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:15]** Nick, are you doing that check on the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** Yeah, I am.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:19]** 28.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:21]** That's going to be a 28 on the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** 28 on the door.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** You don't even need Dr.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:24]** O.K.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:26]** 's thing.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:28]** Dr.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:35]** O.K., a 28 would get you... You do know... I'll say this.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** You're not quite sure...

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:47]** But you're very confident that there are creatures that both can compress and change shape and change form.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:52]** And be large enough to be an imposter for Captain Rumi?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Yeah, they can shapeshift.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:55]** You're fairly certain.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** The name at the time escapes you.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:02]** There's probably just a handful, but you're not quite sure, but you're pretty sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:09]** Do they share any, like... Do these creatures that I know about, specifically, like, which one?

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** Are they, like, in a family or a genus?

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:17]** Do they have any attributes or things that, like, give them away that I could, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:42]** rely on to relay uh i'll say this you know that uh similar to an octopus sometimes the skin of the creature can change depending on emotional feelings nico as you similarly this door just slides back a few inches and then slides over

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:50]** And there is a inner area where if you walk in, it looks to be dusty.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:51]** Niko just steps inside.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:53]** Yeah, just steps inside and gets blown to bits.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:59]** So Niko just did the classic roll 20, moving his pawn.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** And that is canon.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** When you move your pawn, you move.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:02]** You step in.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:05]** There are low lights here.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** that just illuminate the ground.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:17]** And as you look over in the bottom left corner of this 10 by 10 little room, there just seemed to be a ladder that goes up into the darkness.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:22]** It is at this time that Rick, give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** Oh my God.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:26]** 13.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:33]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:35]** Nico, here's Dr. OK.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:38]** You are looking into this room.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Maybe Nico steps in.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:41]** Here's Dr. OK.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:46]** I can picture you both, like, leaning, looking, trying to see what's in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:50]** Nico's doing it traditional tactile style.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:54]** Both hands cupped on one blast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:58]** I mean, I had the cost eject just ready.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** Yeah.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:01]** I'm not inside.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** I'm outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** Yeah, but you're all inside of this chamber.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** You guys are ready.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:08]** Here's has magic missiles going.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:14]** Rick, you are standing gun-mounted on these boxes.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:15]** And...

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:34]** Rick, something catches your ears from directly across from you as you hear the door to the whole room goes and starts to open.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:35]** Can I roll a stealth?

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:38]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:38]** What?

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:40]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** Oh, my God.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:47]** What in the world could be waiting for our players behind this door?

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** I know.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:51]** And so does every GM who's played the three-fold conspiracy.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:52]** Or do they?

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** Did I change the book?

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:58]** Look, being a GM is honestly some of the most fun you can legally have.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:06]** You get to voice a million characters, design and build awesome worlds, and then try to kill your player characters every session.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:17]** You are playing the other characters in the world who, just like the PCs, have all of their motivations and desires and wrinkles in their life, and some of whom want to stop or harm the PCs.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:21]** This is part of what makes the world come to life and be real.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:24]** So I want you, listener, to consider being a GM.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:26]** And if you think you can't GM, think again.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** You can do it.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** And your players will enjoy it.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:32]** Because the goal is for you and them to have fun.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** That's totally achievable.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:36]** If you're worried, look, you will make mistakes.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** Your players honestly probably won't notice.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:40]** And you'll have a great time regardless.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** Trust me.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:44]** When Kevin first asked me to DM, I had never done it.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:46]** So, of course, I was like...

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** No way.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:54]** So then I did DM, and then I decided to be a GM, publicly, on a podcast that's being released to other people.

**[00:59:55 - 01:00:04]** So find a cool adventure or one-shot, call up your friends, say let's play, and when you're done, maybe it'll be the next We'll Save Wednesday, and you'll find out about that door.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** See you on the other side.
