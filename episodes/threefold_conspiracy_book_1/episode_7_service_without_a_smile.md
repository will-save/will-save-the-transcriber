## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Last time on Will Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:08]** In the process of cleaning up the remains, Rick-19 and Dr. O.K.

**[00:00:09 - 00:00:17]** stumble across some suspicious behavior by the head of security of the Chimera, Algiada, and a VESC passenger named Trostenec.

**[00:00:18 - 00:00:22]** In their investigation, Rick-19 and Dr. O.K.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:27]** uncover a mysterious plot to what end remains unknown.

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:36]** All the while, Nico and Hears, refusing to help clean up the dead space lice, bond over drinking and singing an unusual pirate shanty.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:41]** With more questions than answers, we can only speculate as to what is in store for our group of adventurers.

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:45]** Will Algiata and Trost next bring their machinations?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:48]** Find out this time on We'll Save!

**[00:00:48 - 00:00:49]** We'll Save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:40]** Hello, everyone.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:49]** Welcome back to another episode of We'll Save, the group project that you love to do.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:54]** Speaking of group projects, quick question.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:58]** Who are you in group projects?

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:00]** Are you the person who waits until the last second?

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:05]** Are you the person who, you know, just right from the beginning, like you're taking notes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** This is not fair at all.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:10]** This is a cheap shot, John, because you've been in like four group projects with me.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** And so you're going to call me out if I say anything wrong.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** I'm like, oh no, I'm a great leader.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** And you're going to be like, bullshit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** No, that's not true.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** You are.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:21]** I had a good experience with group projects with you, and I've played music with Nick before.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:22]** Yep.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:22]** Right?

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:24]** That's been, you know, it's cool.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** We all have good experiences.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:28]** There's no bad blood.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** That's good.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** Does anyone want to volunteer?

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:33]** So we can tell our listeners what kind of group.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** Fine.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** I'll start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:39]** I actually have so many theories about this, but I will wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:46]** So in group projects, I am normally the procrastinator when it comes to doing actual work.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:51]** but I'm early on leadership and setting up things, if that makes sense.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:57]** But that's because I'm terrible at just like, I don't know, filling out the voids on papers.

**[00:02:57 - 00:03:00]** Like I hate typing and text.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:03]** So yeah, that's where I stand.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:07]** I think I do have pretty good leadership skills though when it comes to group projects.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** John, do you concur with all that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** Yeah, 100%.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:13]** You are typically the person who's like, hey, I set up this log.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:14]** I'm ready to go.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** We can log everything here.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:16]** I'm going to start on this.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** I got these ideas rolling.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:22]** And then you take it, and then you kind of pass it off, and then you come back to it once we've worked with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** It's great.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** Nothing bad to report.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** Cool.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:27]** You can complain about me, too.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** That's allowed.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** Yeah, be honest, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** Call the toll-free number, John.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** Okay.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** I'll call in to our podcast next week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** I'll even take my headphones off if you just want to tell me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:46]** I want you to submit to We'll Save the Podcast on Twitter your experience really with Kev on your pseudonym.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:48]** It'll be a fake account.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** It'll be a fake account.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** Group Project John.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** Just take it to my actual account.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** Come tell me to my face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:57]** All right.

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** Will, do we want to hear your theories or Kelly, Nick?

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:00]** Yeah.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** I don't know.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:02]** Anyone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:03]** Anyone?

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** I guess I'll go.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:05]** Okay.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** All right.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:14]** For me, the person I am in group projects directly correlates to how much I've overextended myself.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:22]** So if I've overextended myself in other facets of my life, then I am that guy who was just...

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:45]** trying to get things done wherever I can whenever I can and it's not necessarily ahead of the ball if I if I am managing my time properly I'm usually pretty on the ball and I'm very reliable in projects and take leadership whenever I can that's like a good well thought answer especially when it's thrust upon me so no

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:55]** You see, you had this great answer, Nick, and then you just had to ruin it with, like, two words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** Whenever you have greatness thrust upon you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** Yep.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:03]** I'm sorry.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:07]** I've been watching a little bit of Community lately, and it was just kind of like, no, I don't know.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** That's a great show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** It's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:11]** You don't need to apologize for watching Community.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:13]** I watched a little bit of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** I don't know what to think yet.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** Watch the paintball episodes.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** Your life will be forever changed.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:22]** I'm just going to jump in with my theory real quick.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** I think it really depends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** Tell us about you first.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:28]** We want to hear about how you were as a group project person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:29]** Yeah.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** How are you in a group project?

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** When we're honest, you have to be honest too.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** It depends.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** And this is why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:40]** So if it's a subject that I give a shit about, I am the person who does all the work.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]** But if it's a subject that I could care less about...

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** I like cool.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** Whatever's fine with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** Yeah.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:57]** I am currently like that in the group that I'm in right now with another, another group project where we have one guy that's doing the class project aligns with his like work project.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:00]** And he, he like loves both.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:02]** And like, I don't care about the topic whatsoever.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** So I'm like, what do you want me to do?

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** I'll do it just to get along.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:13]** Like, yeah, you do like a psychology, you know, whatever bachelor intro one Oh one class you take.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** You do a group project.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:18]** I'm like, I'm not going to show up to that and give it all.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:22]** I'm not going to hunt you down or babysit you into doing work.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** I don't give a shit.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:28]** But working on a project...

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:33]** like an engineering or something, that would be something I'd be like, I actually care that this works.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:35]** Like I'm invested in it.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:47]** So I think it really depends like what people's actual investment in the subject matter is, how much they participate in a group project.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:52]** I've got an idea for a subject that we're all interested in, but I want to hear Kelly.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** You've been silent this whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:56 - 00:07:06]** So what I usually do, which makes me think you're going to drop a bomb when I, when I like join a class is I'll like, look for the people like that, like studied the most.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:09]** I'll kind of like sense it and then like start to inch closer to them.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:13]** Um, and then what I do, you're like, Oh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:16]** Critical success.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:16]** No, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** Listen, I'm not finished.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** All right, hold on.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:21]** Accusations are flying way too early.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:24]** So I like to have contingency plans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** I'm getting a call in from the local news network.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** They want to interview you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** Hold on one sec.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:31]** I'll teach you my technique on the news later.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:33]** So I just like to plan a lot.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:40]** So what I do is I will end up forming a group and I'll be like, okay, everybody take a piece and study this or take a piece and do this.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:43]** But I will also do everything myself as well.

**[00:07:43 - 00:08:04]** so but then I end up getting their opinions and their writings and their thoughts or whatever they're I don't know but maybe because I kind of like come from like a non quantitative background so maybe that's why it's like structured like this but um that's why and yeah but I do everything and I just have them as backups for things I miss out on I don't know I guess it is kind of parasitic yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** I would say it's more like synergetic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Yeah, there you go.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:08]** Symbiotic?

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:14]** Well, is there ever a time where you offer them your knowledge from a subject?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** No, it's a secret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:16]** No.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** I just keep it all to myself.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** Actually...

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** No, I do.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:21]** I do.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** I do.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:22]** Yeah.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:24]** Then it's symbiotic.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** I'm a good person, Kevin.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:26]** Yeah.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:26]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:29]** Yeah.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** Yeah.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:30]** Yeah.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** Unless it's D and D. Yeah, they do.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** Awesome.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:33]** Yeah.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:38]** So, or I should really say star finder or star find D sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:43]** Is there anyone out there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** I'll sync that so it sounds like we're singing it together at the same time.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:52]** I'm not wearing a D&D shirt right now at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** Yeah, I'm definitely not wearing one either.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** I'm wearing a Cub shirt.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** Go Cubs.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** I might just throw that out there.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** Yeah, yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:05]** If I had a Jaguar shirt, I'd probably wear it, but I would never have a reason to wear it, so that's fine.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** I know it's not MLB.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** I just wear black V-necks.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** That's all I wear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** Black V-necks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:14]** Literally every time I've been on this podcast, I've worn that, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:17]** I think, actually, yeah, I think you have.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** But when you're on other podcasts, right, Kelly?

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** Kelly, it's going to be your new call sign.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** Yeah, white V-neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** Your call sign's going to be black V-neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** Yeah.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:38]** So that brings me to what I think is the one subject, as Will says, to corroborate your theory, which is that we all agree on, is RPGs.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:43]** But we're all going to talk about that next week.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:46]** Because now we're going to get into the episode.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** Oh, I know.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** It was so close.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:49]** It was so close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** I'm actually really nervous right now.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:53]** I have so many things I want to talk about about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** Well, now you have a week to think about it.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** You're fine.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:56]** You're fine.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** It's all right.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:58]** Okay.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** Such a tease.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:01]** Such a tease.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:10]** Seriously, I kind of wonder whether or not we should just have a group podcast where we just literally shoot the breeze for an hour and see if people actually tune in.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** That's what other people do.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:16]** We could just make that part of our Patreon.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Yeah.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** That'd be cool.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** A little 30-minute weeker.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** We could even do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:26]** Where we just progressively get more inebriated and just let shit fly.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** Because that's never been done.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** That's never been done.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** We're so responsible.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** That's never been done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** Yeah, we're really responsible.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:36]** I typically have one drink per episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** I am a teetotaler.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** Which means what?

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:47]** It's like an abolitionist person who was against alcohol, like prohibition.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** Like, the people who wanted prohibition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** Wait, in what alternative universe are you that person?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:55]** Yeah.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** That's a joke.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** It was a sarcastic joke.

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** Oh, okay.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** I am so bad at this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** It failed because none of us know big words.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:06]** Hey, I know big words.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** I know the biggest words.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:11]** I know the biggest words of all.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:13]** So many words.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:14]** I do.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** I know all of them.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** Throw them out.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** Too funny.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** Teetotaler.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:23]** Totally a big word, right?

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:23]** No.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** The biggest word.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** It's a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** Who remembers?

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** Yeah.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:31]** Who remembers last week?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:35]** I remembered I was about to die in a hallway thanks to Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** What?

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:40]** That's not true at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:43]** Definitely not true.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:47]** I don't think Kelly and I were in the room for that one.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** I think you actually aren't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:53]** Nick's in his bedroom trying to hack the interwebs, and I don't know what Kelly's doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:55]** Just getting some damn sleep.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** I'm tired.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:59]** I thought Hears was doing his face routine.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** His skincare routine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:03]** Well, the best skincare routine is sleep.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** And that's what I was trying to get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Well, that's it.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** Hopefully it finished.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:11]** Sometimes on this podcast we get little drops of wisdom.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:14]** If you didn't catch it, that was one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** Like, let it be.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:21]** You should really use, like, a face serum at night, you know, instead of just washing.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** It's really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** It's very helpful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:26]** Is Dr. Okay going to provide said face serum?

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:29]** Just give him, like, Botox shots before bed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:55]** yeah he could i prefer he could snail mucus is quite good for faces yeah could we do that just come to you for general life elixirs and stuff like that yeah we can talk about that in two weeks time we can talk about our skincare routines and how mechanically dr okay would provide some bonuses if we use if that was a mechanic in star finder


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:56]** Skincare routine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:58]** Yeah.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:58]** I'm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:01]** I don't know why, but I'm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:09]** I believe you all pushed the doorbell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** Ding dong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** Are we ditching?

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** If you run away, that's up to you.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** Is this Halloween?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** You press the doorbell.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:50]** it like five times now from the number of times that we've done that really wants the attention the door does not open well he must not he must not be home rick's gonna roll perception please do no


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** I rolled 12.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:01]** What do you do?

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:04]** Do you just put your android ear up to the door?

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** Well, Rick's ears are actually on his fingertips.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Oh.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:09]** No, I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:13]** I was like, I don't think that's in the core rule, but it could be cool.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** I don't know.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:14]** Why not?

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** No, he just, yeah, he just listens.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** He probably doesn't hear anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:27]** Yeah, you can't really make out anything there given the sound of the ship that's, you know, in the drift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:35]** Is there any indication of light or anything around the edges of the door?

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:36]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** You can't really tell that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:42]** So Rick's going to turn back to Dr. O'Kane and just kind of shrug his shoulders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:45]** Be like, do you want to break in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Do you want to break in?

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:53]** I do not advise that currently.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:56]** I feel like that might be stepping over the bounds.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:57]** Okay.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:01]** Let's just go check on the professor if that was our concern.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:03]** Yeah, I don't know why you knocked on this door anyway.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:29]** uh that was i'm just gonna i'm not even gonna like dr going he's just gonna move i must have been mistaken and he turns around but rick knew damn well what he was doing that was that that is the door to the vesk that we overheard the conversation with oh i know i just didn't know why


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:38]** Well, he was going to see if they opened it, if there was anything that we saw inside or try to get any kind of... That's why I was like, should we break in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:40]** Rick doesn't like to break rules.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:41]** Rick's a stickler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:45]** Well... Rick... Oh, yeah.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:45]** Rick's a stickler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:47]** What did you say about me, Nick?

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:50]** He's an android.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:52]** He's an android.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:55]** Androids aren't required to be lawful and good.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** They are not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:02]** I don't think any race has any alignment tied to it.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** Starfinder.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** You don't have to be that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:08]** No, but Rick is a lawful good android.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** Okay.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** Yeah, you know, think about it.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:16]** We haven't really said what each of our classes are, but maybe it'll just come out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:19]** I thought we kind of did go over that once.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:19]** Did we?

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** Loosely.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** Nobody's come out and said, do we want to do that?

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:26]** Or do we want to keep it a secret?


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:27]** Keep it a secret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** What if we just all whisper it really quietly?

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:34]** Let's all whisper our classes.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** Ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:39]** Three, two, one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:49]** Today's ASMR brought to you by Wilson.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:52]** Thank you for listening to the ASMR portion of our podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** All right, let's get back to it.

**[00:16:54 - 00:17:00]** So, Rick, Dr. O'Kane, you push the doorbell on the vest room.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:04]** And then the door doesn't open.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:09]** So you go to the door across the way, 10 feet away, Professor Benton's room.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** And you...

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:20]** And when that happens, the door, you hear from the highlight.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:25]** And then the door slides open.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:33]** And you see before you, you see Professor Benjams.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** who's opened the door.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:48]** And you see a woman, human, standing near the bed, near where the table was, where there's a chair.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** She's wearing a flight suit.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** Looks like part of the crew of the Chimera.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** And the door opens.

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:01]** Professor Benjam, oh, hello.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** How are you?

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:05]** Peers out and sees Dr. Okay.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:05]** Hello.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** Hello, Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** How are you, Professor?

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:11]** Feeling better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** I'm doing all right.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:15]** Yeah, I'm definitely feeling better.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** Here, come in.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** Do you want to come in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:17]** Yes.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:20]** Come in.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:20]** Come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** Thank you.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** I'm going to roll perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** John, real quick.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:30]** Do you want Kelly and I to headphones off again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:31]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:32]** No.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:32]** OK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** You walk into.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:34]** OK.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** I rolled 18.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** 18, 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:37]** OK.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:45]** You notice that the room is for the most part pretty kept pretty nice.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:48]** There seems to be his belongings in the corner.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:53]** And you notice that his terminal, maybe the chair has been moved back.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** He's been on the terminal.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** The bed looks like he was laying there on the bed.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:01]** But other than that, nothing really out of place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:05]** There's no medical stuff around or anything like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:11]** You see that the woman, right, is holding a bag.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:18]** And she, as you walk in, she walks over and says, Hi.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:19]** Hi.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** I'm Lozu.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** Hi.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:26]** And shakes, reaches out to shake Dr. O'Kays.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:28]** Hello.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** Lozu, is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** Yes, yes, yes.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** I'm Lozu Pahir.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:45]** I'm the first officer of the Chimera, and I have a bit of medical training, and so I always try and attend to our passengers.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** So I came here to check on the professor.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:51]** Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** She walks over to Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:55]** My name is Rick 19.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** Rick, Rick pleasure.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** And he, he reaches forward and shakes her hand.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** She shakes your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:09]** Well, Professor, I just wanted to come check and make sure you are all right.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:13]** It seems like things will be healed pretty soon.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:16]** So I'm very happy to hear that.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:20]** And he says, thank you so much.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:24]** The standard of care on this ship is just great.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:26]** I know accidents happen.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** It's probably my fault.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:29]** But thank you.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** Thank you.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:35]** And then he turns over to Rick, Dr. O.K.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:41]** Was everything okay after I left?

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:44]** Was dinner okay?

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** Were the bugs okay?

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** How did that all turn out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:56]** I'm sorry to tell you this, Professor, but the asteroid lice had to be disposed of.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:58]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:03]** Why were you transporting such a specimen in the first place?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:06]** Well, that was just my cube, right?

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:07]** That was just something I bought.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** I thought it was interesting.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:11]** And I just bought it and brought it with me.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:12]** That's it.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:16]** Guess maybe I shouldn't have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:20]** You were unaware that there were space lights in it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:22]** No, see, I knew that there were space lights.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:26]** But if you remember, the cube was only so big.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** He kind of shows his hands, right?

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:32]** It was only so big, and they were so little in size.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:36]** So I certainly wasn't expecting it to break open.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** So, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:43]** I hope you all are okay.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:47]** I'm doing a bit better, thanks to Lozu here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:51]** What was so significant about this cube?

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:54]** Just that it's contained with lice?

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** I don't understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** Sure.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:00]** The significance was that it shrinks.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** It shrinks everything.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:02]** Right.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:06]** So the bugs that were inside were small.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:10]** But then when it broke out, I guess they got to be pretty big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:14]** Yes, they were quite large after they broke free.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** Yeah.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:19]** Lozu kind of takes a step forward.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:23]** Thank you again so much for handling that.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:29]** It's not often that we have passengers who are so competent.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** So thank you.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** Thank you very much, both of you.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:36]** And I guess there were some others.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** So if you could please thank them as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** Can I do like a sense motive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:40]** Sure, on who?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** On Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** Sure.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:48]** Ooh, I believe that's a 20.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** I got a 20 also.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:53]** But I have a minus one, so that's actually a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:55]** I got a 17 plus three, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:58]** 17 plus three, okay.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:02]** She seems genuinely thankful that you were able to handle.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** What a waste of a cuddle.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Yeah.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:05]** Wow.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** She seems like a genuine, genuine person.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:19]** Well, with that, I think it's getting closer to bedtime, and I have some things to check in on before I go to bed.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** So good night, all professor.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:25]** I will check in with you tomorrow.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:26]** Goodbye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** She walks out.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:34]** As soon as she leaves, Rick slams the door shut and looks at the professor and says, Tell us the truth!

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** He doesn't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:41]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:43]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:46]** He rips off his shirt and he's just jacked underneath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:52]** Transforms into a giant asteroid louse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:55]** just made me cough on my drink.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** I almost did a spit take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:02]** Uh, Professor?

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** Yes?

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** How did you come by this cube?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:12]** This was just something that I had picked up actually on Legacy Station just at a market.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:20]** Part of what I do is I like to get into the culture of wherever I am.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:23]** And so I was just exploring, walking around Legacy Station.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** And it just seemed interesting.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** I thought it was something that I could bring back.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:32]** I bring back a lot of little souvenirs from my visits and excavations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:36]** Seems like something like that could be useful for smuggling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:58]** something of similar rick does a double take like he he gives you a side look and like are you serious right now i may not be uh maybe old but i'm i'm certainly still a professor so i i don't know what you're insinuating but nothing that was not the case you could unwittingly be uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:01]** Part of something, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** You're saying that I... Oh, I'm so sorry.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:08]** I thought maybe you were saying that I was the one smuggling.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** I am so sorry.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** Of course not.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:11]** That is my apologies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:14]** I would never insinuate a fellow professor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** Oh, you're a professor.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** Well, a doctor.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Oh, wow.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:21]** This is very embarrassing.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** I'm very sorry.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** Take my professorship now, right?

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** No, it's okay.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:34]** So anyway, and then he kind of walks over, sits down on the bed and says, again, thank you so much.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:38]** If there's anything I can do, let me know.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:40]** Otherwise, I...

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:42]** If it's all right, I might turn in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:46]** Professor, before we go, I was wondering if you could answer a couple of questions.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** Sure, please.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:51]** I was wondering if you knew anything about the personnel on board.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** Do I know anything?

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:59]** Like the personnel crew or the personnel passengers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:02]** Either, actually.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:04]** We were looking for answers to both.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:09]** I don't really – well, I know you all, right?

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:09]** I know you two.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:10]** I know the other two.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:16]** I believe the Sheeran, Hears, and the gentleman, Nico, right?

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** I know them.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:23]** I don't know who the Hobgoblin or the Vesk are.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** I'm not so sure.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:28]** And then I'm just – I don't really know the crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:30]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** Sure.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Always happy to help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:37]** Have a good evening, Professor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** You too.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:42]** Professor, if you need anything... I hope you're okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** Was that another pun?

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:48]** I feel like that's a pun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:50]** That is a pun, but here's the thing.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:58]** These punishments that we've instituted now, the doctor okay okay is, you know, that can only be in like really.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:00]** Yeah, that's your like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** That's your go-to.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:06]** I mean, it would have to be special circumstances for it to apply.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:06]** Super special.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** It either has to be especially terrible or especially great.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:15]** It has to be extraordinary pun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:17]** Extraordinary pun.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** Not just an okay one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:22]** Not just an okay one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** I think Kev gets it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** I think Kev gets it.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:26]** I think Kev gets that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** All right.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** Is Kev getting it?

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:28]** Is Kev getting it?

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** All right.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** All right.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** That's, yeah.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** That was, yeah.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:32]** That was good.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:38]** So plus one, right, to whatever you would like, Mr. Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:49]** congratulations so rick's gonna say oh thank you thank you uh rick's just gonna look at the professor and say like if you need anything i am across the hall and one door over


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:54]** Okay, one door to the left or to the right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:58]** Well, there's only one door over, because the other way is down the hall, right?

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:01]** Well, but, yeah, so is it to the left or to the right?

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** I mean, is the professor asking me?

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** I'm asking you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:11]** There's only one door over from... Wait, so are you right across?

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:17]** Because if I go one door to the wrong way, I'm going out the escape pods, and that's not what I'm trying to do here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:19]** Kevin is facepalming.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:25]** No, Rick would... Professor, I will talk to you later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** No, to the left.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:30]** The professor immediately falls asleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** With Rick in the room still?

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:33]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:34]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:39]** You leave, he falls asleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:46]** I think right before we separate, we're just going to ask, did you find anything suspicious back there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:53]** Nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing seems too ordinary around here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:57]** I would have to agree with that, but I think we should call it an evening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** Have a good night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** You too, Android.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:04]** Rick.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** You too, passengers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:07]** No, I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** Android Rick.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:08]** Android Rick.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** He has a name.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** Rick 19.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:18]** Not to be confused with COVID-19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** Wow.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** What a segue.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:23]** Nico, you went into your room.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:26]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:34]** And you said that you were checking the computer terminal to see if your request, right, if your query was returned.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:35]** Yep.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:37]** Okay.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:39]** Trying to find our Patreon on the dark web.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:43]** Yeah, yeah, you're trying to find a Patreon in the infosphere.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:50]** Well, as you come in, you notice, and now here's Rick, Dr.

**[00:29:50 - 00:30:00]** O.K., you all notice this too, that there's like a pop-up on your computer that's just showing the times for breakfast tomorrow, times for lunch, times for dinner, right?

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** Just kind of a floating thing, some information.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:11]** And as you log in, you go and you check.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:16]** And it seems like nothing has come back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** All right.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:30]** Nico, at that point, based off the conversation that he had with Rick and Dr. OK, as a precaution, just as a...

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:59]** back whisper precaution and because Nico's a little paranoid Nico's a little paranoid seeing due to his backstory he's still a little paranoid likes to play it off but he's still a little paranoid he didn't he heard it he can't unhear it now he's just now he just wants to make sure that there's nothing funny going on aboard the ship so Nico wants to see if he can't hack into the ship's intercom and security cameras


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** Interesting.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** As you have this thought.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:05]** Not that I would know anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** There's a notification that comes up.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Okay.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:10]** Saying nothing found.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:13]** You read your message from your query.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** It's come back.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** There's nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:17]** Nico wants to go ahead and forward.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:24]** He wants to place markers on any suspicious footage that the cameras may or may not pick up.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:28]** And he wants them forwarded to his data pad.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:31]** and an alert ping when you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** I'll say this.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:38]** The DC to hack from your terminal into the footage on the ship is very high.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** I don't think you're going to hit it.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** Okay.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:44]** But you can still give me a computers check.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:55]** It's worth it to say a quick thing about computers and Starfinder in that now that there is a computer skill, it doesn't automatically mean that you can just hacker man in.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:58]** There is still kind of like a level of...

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:24]** interface where you do just need to gain access then if you want to gain further access if you want to hack in then provided there are no firewalls or anything separating these modules i know i'm talking to two people here who are software and computer engineers and presumably you all listening there might be some people out there so this is nothing new this might be a little simplistic but the ability to hack in still is not easy to do right

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:32]** But again, that doesn't mean that you can't look at what is there and try and learn something from that if you want to do a computer's check.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** Does that make sense?

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** I'm not trying to shut you down.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** You can still give me that check.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:41]** I'm just letting you know that to do that requires an extraordinary amount of skill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** Sounds like he shut you down, Nick.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:42]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:46]** Does the computer run Windows ME?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:48]** I'm still rolling.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** I'm still rolling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** Does it run Windows ME?

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:58]** Just hold shift and then reboot it.

**[00:32:59 - 00:32:59]** That's it.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** You unlock the secret.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** It opens up.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:04]** I think it was actually F6, but whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** That's going to be a 19 on the roll.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** 19 on the roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:13]** 14 plus 6.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** I'll say this.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** That's 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Sorry.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** That's a 20 on the roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** No, it's okay.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:18]** It's good.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** I'll say this.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:28]** As you're digging through, maybe you're starting to look at some of the properties of the files, right?

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:36]** All these info spheres have videos, popular hollow vids, some limited recent news, right?

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:43]** We talked before about how, when you jump into the drift, there's kind of a limit, right?

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:46]** There's a wall on the information and communication that can come through.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:55]** But you do seem to notice that it is more limited than typically.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:58]** It does seem like there are just maybe not as many choices.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** Could be just the ship.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:04]** Could be the crew.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** Could be what they downloaded.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:09]** Maybe they didn't have enough time to download before leaving Legacy Station.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** But it seems a little odd.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** I'll say that.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:14]** Okay.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** All right.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:15]** I want to finish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** Sorry.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** No, no, it's okay.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:19]** I was just going to say, I don't want.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:24]** You are more than welcome to do as many computer checks as you want.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:31]** But I think in general, like, let's characterize it as this is you over 10, 15, 20 minutes, right?

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** This is what this check gets you.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:34]** Because that's a really good check.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:36]** Doesn't mean you couldn't get better, right?

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** And I'm not necessarily trying to encourage you.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:40]** I'm just trying to say, like...

**[00:34:40 - 00:35:09]** this idea of taking 10 taking 20 on things right like taking time right so then that way it feels like a meaningful thing and as you're searching through that's kind of that's what you find tonight you know okay that's the conclusion that you come to okay uh just a quick answer though like i was not successful in being able to see security footage or being able to forward anything to my database correct correct sorry i didn't address that exactly explicitly earlier but yeah you weren't able to like access any of that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:11]** Not even any audio?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** No, right?

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:22]** Because that requires going through whatever firewalls they've set up into that part of their database and then being able to get access to that in the first place, right?

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** So it's multiple checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** Okay.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:34]** Well, Nico is going to make a mental note to himself at this point to every night just make sure that he is keeping tabs on all of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** Yeah, because, I mean, you got the message back, right?

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** You were sitting there going through it.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:39]** You checked it first.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** While you're sitting there, it comes back.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** And you're like, let me just keep going through.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** That's what you noticed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** What did the message say, by the way?

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:52]** I don't think you mentioned that the message came back, but I don't think you mentioned what it said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** Nothing found.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:54]** Right.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** You had put out a query to see if there was anything.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:01]** It came back saying nothing pinged back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:04]** Nothing pinged back about whether or not I was wanted on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** Exactly.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:08]** There were no warrants out.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** There was no information.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:09]** Okay.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:13]** You feel confident that the answer you got back is what's out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:15]** Okay.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:21]** Yeah, Nico's going to go to bed, and he's just going to make sure that the last thing he does is that he locks his door and triggers an alarm.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:25]** What are you thinking as you get in bed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:28]** Nico's just still feeling a little buzzed going to bed.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:31]** But aside from that, he's going to be sleeping like a baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** Like a little baby Grayson.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:37]** Aw.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:37]** Aw.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:39]** Shout out to Ken's baby.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:43]** He hasn't been sleeping much at all lately, but okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** That's why this is a fantasy.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** If you have any suggestions, write in.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:50]** Fantasy role playing.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** Rick, Dr. Okay hears.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** What are you...

**[00:36:54 - 00:37:01]** What are you all thinking as the door shuts and it's the end of your day, your first day here on the Chimera?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:10]** Rick lays down on his bed, but the biggest question is, do androids dream of electric sheep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** Okay, Philip K. Dick.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:20]** I think Dr. Okay is just, his thoughts are, what the heck's going on here?

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** What did I get myself into?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:36]** Here's is reflecting on that shared drunken shanty that he had with Nico and is curious how he happens to know that.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** He's planning to ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** Brick, are you just dreaming of electric sheep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** The silence is eerie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** Yeah, it's eerie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** I think that was everybody, right?

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** We all said what we were going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:56]** I didn't know that your joke was your answer, Kif.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** It kind of was.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** He's going to bed.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:58]** Okay.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:58]** All right.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** That's fine.

**[00:37:59 - 00:37:59]** Cool.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** So you all go to bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:04]** The night passes.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:09]** And it is the next morning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** Do we get eight hours of sleep?

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:14]** You get eight hours of rest.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:14]** Yes.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** You do.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:16]** Nice.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:19]** This is the first time we've recovered, so does anyone want to go over it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:22]** How do I do it in Hero Lab?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** In Hero Lab, I think you just add them back in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** Yeah, you just add them.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:27]** Oh, wait.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** There is a rest and recharge button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** Oh, look at that.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:36]** Thank you, Hero Lab and Sirenscape and Paizo and Roll20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** Right below resolve points.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** Right below the resolve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** Booyah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** Ah, there we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** Yeah.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** Oh, wow.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:44]** Very good.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** Very good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** Very good.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** But do we want to just look at the mechanics of it?

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:53]** It said, I just had it, page 251, I think, in the core rulebook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:53]** Yeah.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:54]** Read it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:57]** I'm not even there yet.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** Slow down.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** Tell the audience.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** So it says healing.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** It follows under healing.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:13]** But recovering stamina points, you can regain all your stamina points by spending one RP, which is a resolve point, and taking a 10-minute uninterrupted rest.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:19]** Or after a full night's rest of eight hours of sleep or more, you regain stamina points automatically.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:21]** Some abilities give you a blah, blah, blah.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:21]** Okay.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:23]** And then the other thing is recovering hit points.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** So hit points is a little different.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:27]** So you gain all your stamina points when you do a full rest.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:36]** A full night's rest for hit points, eight hours of sleep or more, you recover one hit point per character level.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:40]** Any significant interruption during your rest prevents you from healing that night.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:46]** So if you have eight hours of uninterrupted rest, you get whatever your level is and hit points back.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:51]** So stamina or full recharges, hit points only at one HP per level.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:52]** Nice.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** Questions?

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:54]** Questions?

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:55]** Moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:59]** None.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:00]** Nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** All right.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** So you wake up.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** Don't know what time you wake up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:11]** Maybe... Slugs are early risers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** That's true, because they're always out on the street.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** Yeah, because it's moist out.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** In the morning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** Yeah, in the morning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** My favorite word.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:23]** Moist.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** Moist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** Being a slug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** Moist.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** Let's hear moist in Dr. O'Kays.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Moist.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:35]** Oh, boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:43]** Man, it's definitely good when you're trying to provide an atmosphere and people are just like, moist, moist, moist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:54]** I guarantee you someone is going to think about that and do like an hour's worth of just saying the word moist with ambient music in the background and just stick it up on Spotify for an hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:56]** I'm sure somebody's already done that.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** Tag us.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** Tag us if you haven't done it already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** No thanks.

**[00:40:59 - 00:40:59]** Let us know.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:01]** Leave me out of that.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** Don't tag Kevin Decker.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:09]** Whatever you do, don't tag Kevin.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:25]** So maybe you all wake up a little roughly at the same time because from outside your door, you all hear the sound of raised voices, heated discussion coming from outside the hall.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:27]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** I go outside immediately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Okay.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:38]** Nico's gonna wake up and kind of take the blasters that he had underneath his pillow and he's gonna go to the door and listen.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** So Dr. O.K.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** steps out.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** Nico, you step up.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Put your ear up to the door.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** You don't open the door.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** Rick, here's.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:51]** I'll walk to the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:55]** He'll pick up his gun from his nightstand and walk to the door.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** Which direction is it coming from?

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:02]** Can I do a perception to see what am I hearing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:08]** Yeah, it sounds like you're hearing raised voices and heated discussion from down towards the cafeteria.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:14]** And Dr. Okay hears, as you step out, you actually see... A giant chimera.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:16]** You see a chimera.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:19]** No, you see Song...

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:25]** seems to be standing in front of the door to the dining hall.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:38]** Their arms are crossed, and they seem to be blocking the hobgoblin and the goblins from entering.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:46]** And as you step out and see them talking, you see the hobgoblin kind of step up and get right in Song's face.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:57]** Song seems to—their face kind of distorts a little bit and says, You can't bring those fiends in here anymore.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** Song points to the goblin sucker.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:08]** They ate twice their allotted portions last night, and they made a right mess doing it, and I was up all hours.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:16]** I was scrubbing on my knees, and I won't be spending the rest of this trip tidying up after them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:25]** And then the hobgoblin straightens her spine and snarls, You dare to bar us from a rightful repast?

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:32]** I paid good credits for passage aboard this bucket of rust and I demand satisfaction.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:45]** Well, you can take your food and go and I'll pack it up for you and you can clean up after yourselves or wallow in it or do whatever you want in your own blasted cabins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:48]** This is going on loudly.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** That's what you just heard.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:57]** Nico at this point is going to step out, and he's just going to be casually, very nonchalantly looking down there.

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:06]** Just one hand always on the blaster, ready to draw, but not really doing anything quick to do anything about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:13]** Professor Benjam steps out and also seems to be walking forward, a little confused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:28]** Rick holsters his tactical pistol, and then he's going to shoulder on his artillery laser and then pull his trench coat up over the artillery laser, pop his collar, and then step into the hallway.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** He does it very casually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:36]** Dr. Okay is going to walk up and go by them and say, excuse me, do you know where the gym is?

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:39]** And then continue walking towards the gym.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:43]** Okay, so goes, starts to walk around the corner.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Yes.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:47]** Roll initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:49]** Excuse me, pardon.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** They just move out of your way.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** They look and they see you.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:58]** And Song turns and says, can you, can't you agree?

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:58]** You were there.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** You saw all of them being dirty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** Doctor, okay.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:09]** I will not presume to know anything of anyone for cleanliness sake, but okay.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** And then I'll just keep walking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Okay.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:12]** So you keep walking.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** Rick hears.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Nico, what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:20]** Rick starts to walk up, and are these two doors open?

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** Which doors?

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:22]** These ones?

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** No.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** They're closed.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:26]** I'm assuming it's from the Hobgoblins.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** I wasn't sure if they just opened and walked out.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:39]** But anyways, so he's going to walk up casually and kind of step in between the professor, and he's going to put his hand kind of down and try to indicate for the professor to back off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** Okay.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:40]** Here's Nico.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** What do you do?

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:45]** Nico's going to walk up next to yours, and he's just going to be like,

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:47]** What the hell's that all about?

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Let's go watch.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** I want to see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:53]** So you all step up, okay?

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:56]** You all step up as you do the hobgoblin.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** Pack it up, then, cookie!

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:03]** And the space goblins kind of cackle and laugh.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:16]** And Song blows some air out of their nose from their artificial lungs, goes back in, quickly comes back out a few seconds later and shoves a bag into the hobgoblin's chest.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:17]** Take it!

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:27]** The hobgoblin gives this kind of feral look and then they all walk back into the door that is on the professor's right.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:29]** As this happens, Dr.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:33]** O.K., as you're walking around the corner... Sorry, Rick, were you going to say something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:36]** I mean, he just kind of steps forward and gets out of the way.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** Okay.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** And that's the pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:38]** Okay.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:40]** As that happens, Dr.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:42]** O.K., you're walking around the corner.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:48]** You actually see Lozu coming down the corridor.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:49]** Oh, hi.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** Good morning.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Good morning, Doctor.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:51]** Okay.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** How are you?

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:57]** She looks a little, like, a little antsy, a little nervous.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Oh, okay.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** Can I roll a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** I am fine.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:02]** How are you?

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:06]** And can I roll sense motive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:06]** Sure.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** I'm good.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** Just got a lot on my mind.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** Seventeen.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:14]** Okay.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** I started to react as if I was her.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** Oh, yes.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** You like it.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:25]** She walks past you, turns, and sees actually Song.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** Song, can I?

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:30]** I'm doing good, Doctor.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:30]** Okay.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:32]** Yeah, I'm doing good.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:32]** Thanks.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:33]** Thanks.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** I appreciate it.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:40]** It's at that moment that Song turns, sees Lozu, and says, One second.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:45]** Song then looks down the hall and says, What are you looky-loos doing?

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:47]** You didn't say anything.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:50]** I had to ask your friend Dr. Okay here.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** You didn't corroborate.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** You didn't help me out at all.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** It would have been nice to have some help here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:55 - 00:48:01]** Rick steps forward and like looks Song in the eye and says like, as a fellow android, I promise I have your back.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:04]** I would have protected you had that gone sour.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Trust me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:08]** Okay, I appreciate that.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:10]** Just next time would have been nice.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:14]** I don't often have to deal with hostile, crazy people like this.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:16]** This is frustrating.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:19]** And it's at that point that Lozu starts to move and walk over.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:21]** Song, Song, I just need to ask you.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** That was so fast.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** She just like slid across the screen.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:27]** Yeah, it's almost like she was dragged by some external powerful force.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** On roll 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:35]** It surrounds us, binds us, penetrates us, binds the galaxy together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:38]** Metachlorians, obviously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:43]** Hashtag Alec Guinness.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:47]** Song, look, Song, I guess you're all here.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:53]** Song, have you heard from or have you seen Algiata?

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:57]** No, I would have appreciated her help now.

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:03]** These looky-loos here didn't help me at all, and it would have been nice if she... No, look, Song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:07]** I helped you by allowing you to solve your own battle, Song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** Okay.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:12]** Oh, my gosh.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** Lozu says, look, that's no matter.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:23]** Look, Song, can you just... And maybe you all here, you all seem pretty competent.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:28]** Look, can you just tell me if you see her, maybe hear from her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** Where are her quarters?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:37]** Her quarters are up in the crew section, but I went to check on her, and she's not answering.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:41]** And her door's locked, and I just...

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** I haven't seen her.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:43]** I haven't seen her.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:50]** So if any of you see her, then please just have her check in with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:54]** Has anyone checked the security cameras, perhaps?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:58]** I will have to go check and go see.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:00]** I can assist you in that.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** No, it's okay.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:03]** Look, it's not too big of a deal.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:08]** And then she kind of takes a step and just says, please just let me know if anything happens.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** She starts to walk down the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:16]** Nico wants to pause her before she walks by.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** And he's just going to be like...

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:20]** I heard you're missing somebody on the security staff.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:23]** They're missing the security chief.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** Yeah, Algiata.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:26]** Yeah.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:32]** And Professor Benjam steps up and seems to also be concerned.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:34]** Yeah, I just haven't seen her.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** I'm not quite sure.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:39]** Not quite sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:41]** That doesn't seem like a small matter.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:46]** I have some expertise with weapons and security cams and technology.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** I'd be happy to assist in this matter.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** Okay.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:54]** And I'm going to roll diplomacy, too, just to kind of plant the suggestion.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:57]** And this is what I'm going to say with that diplomacy roll.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:06]** It's going to be like, no one would be happy in the event that not all measures were taken and all resources taken advantage of.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:09]** When the security chief disappears.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** What did you roll?

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** She asked that openly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:18]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** I'm asking Nick what he rolled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** That's a 16 plus 6.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:23]** That's a 22.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** 22.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:26]** Nicely done.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:31]** Yeah, so she seems for a moment, thinks about it.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** You can tell she's got a lot of things going on.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** Yeah, I...

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:38]** You know, I think I really appreciate that.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** Maybe I will ask you for some help.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** Look, I need to just take care of a few things.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** If that's okay.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Look, I'll reach out.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** Thank all of you.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** Thanks to all of you.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:49]** Sorry.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:49]** Sorry.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** I'm just a little nervous.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** Just a little strange.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:53]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** What is there to be nervous about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:55 - 00:52:01]** I'm just worried because people just don't go missing aboard the ship.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** Honestly, with... Yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** I'm just saying everything that's happened, I'm not surprised.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** Everything has happened on this trip.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** This is a boondoggle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** I don't know what a boondoggle is.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:20]** I don't know what that is either, but... Hey, I'm going to agree with yours here.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:24]** It took over 20 minutes and a blast to fight before I was able to get my scotch.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:29]** Wait, is Song still standing there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** It was good scotch, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:34]** Normally, they just handle it out as you arrive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:44]** Song is still standing there, but as Lozu starts to turn and walk away... Rick's going to brush past these guys and kind of just tap her on the shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** As you tap on the shoulder...

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:51]** There's a sound of like distant in the ship.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:58]** Lights are going to go out.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** And the power...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:00]** Where the lights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:01]** Cuts out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** Go out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** And the entire corridor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** On the camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:05]** Falls into darkness.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** Kevin, I like it.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** I like it.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** This is bullshit.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** I didn't even need to say that's game.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** One more thing.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** I just started playing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** You just knew.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** We just knew.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:18]** This is scary now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:20]** Now everyone's going to be dead.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:22]** How do flashlights work in Starfinder?

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Greetings.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** I am the android, Rick19.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:32]** I have to admit that I am quite concerned with our current situation.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:35]** Something here is not right.
