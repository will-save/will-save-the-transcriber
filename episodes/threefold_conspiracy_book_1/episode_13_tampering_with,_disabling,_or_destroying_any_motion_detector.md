## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:07]** Last time on Will Save, the crew finds a new clue in their search for Algiada.

**[00:00:08 - 00:00:09]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:00:09 - 00:00:15]** inspects the discovered tail ring closer and realizes it is a traditional Yasuki tail ring.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:25]** But before the group can follow up, the group is interrupted by a rude band of goblins under the command of hobgoblin Gingeroga.

**[00:00:25 - 00:00:29]** The groups part, and our heroes head to the crew quarters.

**[00:00:29 - 00:00:35]** On the way, they discover a part from a long-lost ship, the Star Dream 2.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:42]** Things take a dangerous turn upon finding Algiata's room, as they hear the sound of something charging up.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:45]** What has the group walked into now?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on Willsafe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:52]** Do you guys think it's true that if you're the kid who just throws notes and assignments into your book bag when you're in elementary school that you'll grow up to be somebody who doesn't take notes during your D&D session?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** I never took notes anyway.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:58]** I guess that explains it.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:58]** Because that was me.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:01]** I like participating in class discussions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:06]** I am terrible at taking notes, but I'm the only one in this group that takes notes on our shared Google Drive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:08]** That's not entirely true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** I'm going to help you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:14]** That's going to be my... No, Will just decides to snipe from the sidelines in the notes section.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** That's his fun area.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:18]** Will only adds comments and footnotes.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** So, fun side note.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:24]** Like, in our D&D game, we try to tame some wolves, like, second week.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:25]** What's D&D?

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** Dungeons and Dragons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** No, no, no.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** That doesn't exist here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Well, okay.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:39]** Let me finish the damn story.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:47]** In an unnamed role-playing game, we tried to tame some very feral wolves.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** And none of us had animal handling.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:53]** It was literally the stupidest move ever.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:53]** Ever.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:57]** And we ended up having to freaking kill these wolves.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:06]** And I find like two weeks later, Will's posted in the comment section of this guy standing over three dead wolves with a damn crossbow.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** Don't give away.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** And Will.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** That was Kevin?

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** That was Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:15]** I assumed it was Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:18]** I'm the only one that takes notes.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** That's not true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:26]** Can I also just call out the literary device that Nick used, which is the unreliable narrator device?

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:30]** Because Nick was the one who wanted to make the animal handling happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:33]** didn't want him to die.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** I fully acknowledge that.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:39]** And we were all bitching about it the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:43]** It made for an excellent inside joke.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Sorry, not sorry.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** Inside jokes really work well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:49]** And the wolves all died in ignominious ways.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:51]** I think the last one rolled off of some ball bearings.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:55]** It was so pathetic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** I take notes occasionally.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** I know, Will.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** I'm just poking at you.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:02]** And here's the problem.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** This is what happens, okay?

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:10]** My problem with taking notes in Google Drive collectively is that...

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:18]** When we're both taking down the same information at the same time, we will edit each other's shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:23]** And that's why I try to, like, if I see you typing, I stop and let you finish typing.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:27]** It takes some coordination and some give and take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:34]** I have been on the same sentence with you, trying to, like, return down...

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:38]** And then you end up being at that same cursor point.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:41]** And then we just type over each other.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:44]** And it's like, what the heck are we even doing here?

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** What are we doing?

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** Why are we doing this?

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** I just abstain now.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** And I'm not going to do it.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** You just courteously abstain.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:50]** At all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** Yeah, that's the problem, though.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:56]** Because when I'm not actually actively typing, then nothing gets typed.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:58]** And I can't actively type all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** See, this is what happens when we have nice things.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:03]** It's okay.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** It's good.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** You guys will learn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** It's good.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:11]** So let's jump into the content of those notes.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:15]** I want to know whether it's in the notes or not.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** What are your characters?

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:17]** Okay.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:17]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:24]** I have my notes open, and I'm ready to Control-F it.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:26]** Is that Control-F-U-C-K-Me?

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:30]** I'm just going to Control-F it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:32]** What shortcut is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:32]** Control-F?

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** It's the find feature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:40]** Oh, I thought it would be propeller command.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** It is.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:42]** It's Command-F on a Mac.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:44]** It's Control-F on a Mac.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:47]** Will Garrett, computer software developer.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:47]** It's a short key.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** It's a short key.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** So what are we looking for?

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** Well, not looking for.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** I just want to ask.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** Nothing pops up.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:56]** What are you all thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:00]** What are your characters thinking?

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:25]** thinking i mean like now that this gunshot has rang on now that there's a gunshot now that you've found something a panel of the ship that says the name of this other ship that vanished now that trostenek has you know shouted out the name of keeve what do you what are you thinking i trust no one nico at the moment is kind of uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:34]** Nico wants to find out all the information and find the relic and then sell the information and the relic to the highest bidder.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:40]** So he wants to control the situation, control the knowledge and sell it when it suits him and his friends the most.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:43]** Now, walking into that room, there's only one thing on his mind right now.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:47]** And that is, oh, control beep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:50]** I think Lozu sold us up the river.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** John, can we get a bleep in motion?

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** Wait, what, Nick?

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:57]** Can we get an actual censor sound on that one?

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:58]** All right, cool.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** And Kevin, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:03]** We never censored ourselves ever until Nick wants to be censored.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** Self-censorship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:08]** And then I actually did censor myself just then, and it was through an act of will.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:10]** Thank you, Kevin.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:10]** An act of will?

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:11]** An act of will.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** An act of will.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** Will save my censors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** No punishment for me there?

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** No.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** That was a stretch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** John, what was your question?

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:22]** Sorry, what was...

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:26]** Oh, I was just going to say, you know, it's a tough thing.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** You get on the ship.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:32]** You're headed towards, you know, Absalom Station.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:38]** And it feels like each time you go somewhere new, something happens.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** You talk to somebody.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** Somebody's unconscious.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** Somebody's standing in the hall, completely motionless.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:53]** And I just wanted to tap into your character's psyches for a second to see what you were thinking.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** You feeling stressed?

**[00:07:55 - 00:08:02]** Because now you all have become kind of the de facto unofficial task force investigators to look into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:05]** Yeah, Rick is definitely on edge.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:11]** There's only three people that he kind of trusts on this ship right now, and it's the three people in the hallway with him.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:16]** And even then, he barely knows these guys, and he just doesn't know what to make of them.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:29]** But I guess like all the pieces going together right now is we know that Keeve and Lozu are in some kind of relationship, probably romantic.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** Some tryst.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** Assignation.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:33]** Say again?

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** Some tryst.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:34]** Tryst.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** Tryst.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** Is that – that's got a positive connotation to it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:42]** I think assignation is maybe one of the four.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:56]** And then the other connection we know that Al Giada, the security officer, also has a connection to one of the – to the Vesk passenger who is possibly an arms dealer or –

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** Something or other.

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:03]** Their connection is very strange, too, because we overheard them having that conversation about going through with a plan or not.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** So there's at least two different factions going on.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:10]** Then we got the weird Hobgoblins and Goblin group running around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** Yeah.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:14]** They were trying to keep it secret, right?

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** Like Lozu and Keefe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** That's the strange part.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:20]** That just came out now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:24]** That's what I was referring to by Trist, like a secret meeting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:30]** Well, no, because I don't think the relationship between Lozu and Keeve is that secret.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:34]** But I think their motives are secret.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:39]** Because Tristan X shouted, it's Keeve to me.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:41]** as they left the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:50]** So that's saying that whatever is... I don't trust Nick or trust Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Thank you, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:53]** That was a joke.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** That was good.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:56]** I actually do trust you, Nick.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:56]** You're great.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:57]** Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:58]** Nico Orion.

**[00:09:59 - 00:09:59]** Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** Yeah, where is Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:04]** You know about the star whatever.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** You knew about the star dream too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:09]** I also know about Leonardo Copernicus too.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** Leonardo Copernicus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:15]** To circumnavigate the stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:20]** I vote that we try to bring that back sometime in an illusion or something like that, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:24]** I think Lozu sold us downriver, man.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:29]** She sent us up to this room to get shot at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:38]** There's a distinct possibility of that, but in any case, we learn more by getting shot at than we did by not talking to her and keeping things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:43]** Yeah, for all we know, they could all be in cahoots, and we should just take over the ship and run with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** Yeah.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:45]** Wow.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:48]** I'm working on some cue music for John on that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** For the moment when you just take over the ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** For the moment where we just start killing everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:53]** Wow.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:55]** So you're just going to murder some people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:55]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:56 - 00:11:01]** I thought we were going to try and go into this secret hideout and tame them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** Oh, yeah, that's exactly what we're doing.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:09]** John, what's our animal handling skill?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:09]** Zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:12]** Survival has a degree of animal handling in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:12]** Here's.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:13]** Go ahead.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:23]** Here's is still curious why Lozu just stopped and stared deadly at the wall, like an angle, until we woke her from whatever trance she was in.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:29]** And to be honest, as much as everything is happening bit by bit...

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:46]** like and here's almost got crushed by like a hug about he's pretty excited because like for the longest time he's been laying low for months and months after being kicked out of the free captains and so to have some action is pretty great yeah that's true yeah the loser standing the hallway thing is very strange

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:52]** Is that some kind of mind takeover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:58]** Yeah, and spooky is... Spooky is like this double-edged sword.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** I love it, but I hate it at the same time.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:03]** Because you get all spooked?

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:15]** We may or may not have another game through an unnamed role-playing system that we played a really creepy dungeon with this weird creature that could read our minds and like...

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** Oh, it was so dark and scary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** It was like my skin crawled.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:22]** A guy looking at you out of the darkness, whispering in your ear.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** The Gnostic.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** The Gnostic.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:26]** Oh, if there's any kind of that in this.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** That was crazy cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:30]** All right, where's Dr. Okay stand on all of this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** I think Dr. Okay said.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** You said, right?

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** You said where you stand on all this.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** He doesn't trust anybody.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** You don't trust anybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:40]** Don't trust nobody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:48]** Also, yeah, I thought we could... Lozu sending us to this room to get shot at?

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** Sounds like a trap.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:53]** I'm going to send her out the airlock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:57]** But then again, it could be that Algiada is still alive.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:58]** She's an imposter.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:03]** And she's in that room trying to defend herself, and Lozu knew this, and so she sent us to kill her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** Could be.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:06]** Furiously takes notes.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:07]** Fucking A, man.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** Yeah.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** Who's shooting at us, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** Well, I think it's time- Reveal it.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:13]** Yeah.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:19]** To give you all and the listeners what they want, and that's to know what's going on.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** So, if you direct your attention-


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:43]** to the map so


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** I really just wanted to let that go for a minute.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** I just wanted that to just loop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:51]** Did anybody know what that was?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** Are you just scatting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** No, we never know your references.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** It was Pokemon, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** Yeah.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Yeah.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:01]** Whenever you encounter like a wild encounter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** Yeah.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** It's on the counter.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:04]** I hear it now.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:08]** Suddenly the screen in front of you eight bits into a little.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:10]** Hide hearing being 2020.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:13]** My hearing's always 2020.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:13]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** Behind hearing this 2020.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:25]** The shot comes at you, Deco.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** What is your EAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** Oh, beep me.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:32]** Let's see here.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:36]** EAC is 12.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:38]** Your yakety yak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** 12?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:42]** Yeah, it's 12.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:45]** I'm probably going to get really hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** I rolled a 23.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:56]** This shot hits you square in the chest.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** Oh, no.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** For 12 points of damage.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** Holy cow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** You are, John, we're going to have words after this game here.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** Let's have words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** Dude, are you even still alive?

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:09]** Yeah.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:14]** What's going on with you and your health right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** I'm in bad shape here.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:16]** That hurt.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** Let's see here.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** I have six points of stamina.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** You said that's 12.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:24]** So that's going to be four points of health remaining.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** Four points.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:27]** So you dropped your stamina.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** You're at four points of hit points remaining.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** You're out of stamina.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:30]** Yeah.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** I am out of stamina.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:36]** So that's like one shot and you're dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** Yeah, that really is the case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** What do you do, Nico?

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:43]** I'm sure it just rocks you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** It does.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** So I'm going to go ahead.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:49]** I'm going to show on the map, and I'm going to verbalize what happens.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:49]** Yes, please.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:54]** When Nico gets shot, he's going to get blown back, and he's going to get blown back in the ears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** I believe it.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:03]** So Nico's going to be knocking ears down because he just gets shot.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:06]** Can I roll something for this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** I don't want to get knocked down.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** Strength and reflex?

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:13]** You could roll an athletics check real quick to see if you get knocked down.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** Oh, great.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Yeah.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:15]** Let's see how that.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:16]** There's a reflex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** It's pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:19]** Okay.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:22]** So you kind of step back and maybe you catch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** I want to catch him.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** I don't want him to fall to the ground.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** Yeah.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:25]** Okay.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** You catch him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** He thinks like, oh, best Mara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:30]** How do I manage health in this right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:35]** You can click on it, and then it brings up increase or decrease and reset and undo.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** Thank you, Hero Lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:36]** Where's that?

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:38]** I can't see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:44]** Stamina and hit points are right at the very top of the combat tab in the very middle of the screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:47]** I could use a potion here right now.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** Okay.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:51]** So what are you all thinking?

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:51]** What are you going to do?

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:53]** Your shot?

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:55]** What do we roll for initiative at that point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:55]** Yeah, what's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** Well...

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:57]** That's the thing.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:01]** As soon as Nico falls back, Rick, you take a step, you look in.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** No other shot.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** Your role perception?

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** Comes at you.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** And in fact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** Yeah, she's probably just scared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:14]** What you see is what appears to be some sort of.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:16]** Is it a bot?

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:16]** Gun.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:16]** Trap?

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:21]** Mounted to the wall, to the far wall.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** It was a trap.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:25]** Aimed at the door.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:32]** You can see a little wisp of like, seems like smoky, frosty stuff coming off of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** All right.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** Rick is going to step right into the doorway.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:35]** Okay.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:37]** And roll a perception on the roof.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:37]** Okay.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** I got 10.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** Okay.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** Perception check.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:42]** 10.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** 10.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** on the room.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:50]** So there's clearly a door here, right in front of me.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:53]** Looks like there might be two doors, like French doors to the left of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:58]** Well, so as you step in, you see the rest of the room.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:04]** It looks, again, as I read last time, it looks pretty neat and simple.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:08]** It's a desk, bed, chair, lounge.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:11]** Can't really see too much else.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:14]** There doesn't seem to be anybody in there with your 10.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:18]** Nico inheres as you're looking down at your wound, Nico.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:21]** Let's get into healing it in just a sec.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:28]** You notice that some of the skin around where you were hit is like bone cold.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** Like you took cryo damage.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** Like ice damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:38]** Nico's going to be looking up at everybody else.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** Now that's cold.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:43]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:48]** Is that punishment?

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:50]** Yeah, I give it a thumbs up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** I'll give it a thumbs up.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:56]** This is turning into lethal weapon meets Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:06]** I'm going to administer some, I think, treat deadly wounds to Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Yep.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:09]** What is treat deadly wounds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:13]** I guess you use medicine to restore hit points.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:42]** yeah but it's a certain dc takes so yeah it's dc is based on the medical equipment used i can't i'm using my my micro lab my custom micro lab uh but i don't know what the dc is uh it's probably in the equipment section let's look i think it's 25 what no yeah because that's what it was 25 i think that's wrong i have to roll really high


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** Or you could take 20, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:50]** You cannot take 20 on medical checks to treat the other ones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:58]** And I rolled a 16, which is one short of what I need.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** Literally one short.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:12]** And yes, I actually, fun fact, we stopped recording for a moment and I rolled it off air and I rolled a 16 off air and I just re-rolled it.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:34]** for fun and it was also a 16 so it's meant to be fate decided 24 dc 25 your wounds are fucked he completely ignored me when i told him you need to roll higher you all right buddy hey there's a bed here you can just lay down you can just lie down uh nico's gonna be like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** That one's going to leave a mark.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** Cold, cold.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:37]** All right.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:38]** I'm pissed.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** We'll get you sound.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** Where is that?

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** Where is that gun?

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** Where is that gun?

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** I want to see that gun.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** Where's that gun?

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** Rick holds up his hand and says, easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** Take it easy.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** It appears as though it was some kind of trap.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** I don't care what it was.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:52]** Nico, why are you walking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:56]** Don't just march into a room.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:56]** All right.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:58]** So what?

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** So Nico starts running into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:01]** I got up.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:02]** I walked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** Nico's walking up to the room.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:07]** You see, give me an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** Do I have engineering skill?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:09]** Do you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:11]** That is a better question.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:13]** I would think that you would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** I have an engineering skill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** I do, actually.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:17]** Yeah, especially because you're... I do.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** Give me a roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** I'll assist with that.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** Okay, you're assisting?

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** With my engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:26]** That is a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** I have a 13.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** Yeah, I can assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:31]** A 12, 13, so that's 14.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:35]** And then Dr. Okay is assisting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:36]** Yeah, I failed.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:37]** Okay, you failed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:37]** That's fine.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:38]** It's okay.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:39]** I'll tell you this.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:42]** The roll tells you two things.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:46]** One, you see where this gun is attached to the wall.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** It's like mounted onto the wall.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:52]** And you realize that you can take it off.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** You can demount it.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** All right.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:59]** But, Debs, you realize that...

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:04]** It is a sub-zero ice carbine.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:12]** And from your roll, you think it was probably rigged to overload, to overcharge.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:13]** Oh, no.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:15]** And fire a bunch of its ammo in a single shot.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** That's why it hit you.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:20]** That's why it was so deadly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:24]** So what do you want to do?

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** Nico's going to ask if anybody wants this.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:32]** Nico's going to say, all right, well, might as well take this as a souvenir.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:32]** Who wants it?

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** I'm going to take it down.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** Oh, yeah, I'll take it.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:35]** I'll take it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Rico raises his hand.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** Sorry, Rick raises his hand.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** Rico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:43]** What was the mechanism to fire it?

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** Can we look at that?

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** Rick needs to clear the room.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Okay, let's do this one at a time.

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:02]** Will, I'm going to take your 19 and I'm going to use it as part of your room check, unless you want to do other stuff.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** We'll get to the other stuff in a second.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** We'll get to just the room.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** But you look, Dr.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:12]** O.K., and you see there are motion sensors mounted inside the doorway.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:17]** So soon as Nico walked through, then they went off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:18]** Great.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** Are they hardwired?

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** Are they wireless?

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:23]** They, like, go to a computer controller?

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** Bluetooth?

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:30]** Like, MacGyvered or, like, over-engineered like Mark Roper?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** MacGyver.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:36]** Seems like they were put in... Paperclip, rubber band, hairspray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:41]** You would think that the doors don't have motion sensors on them, but they were rigged to the gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** Like, to the trigger assembly?

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** Like, there's an actual, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:55]** If we're splitting hairs here... No, I mean, it was rigged to allow the gun to go off as soon as they went off.

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:00]** Can we... So it's just a simple control, like... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:03]** So it wouldn't alert someone remotely that someone went into this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:08]** You would need to make a computer check on the motion sensors.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:08]** I will do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** Okay, go ahead.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:12]** Yeah, and I'll assist.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:12]** Yep.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:14]** I successfully assist.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:15]** I did a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:16]** So 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:18]** I'm guessing Will got really high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:18]** Yeah.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** Yeah.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:25]** They don't... I say computers because rather than engineering, you could have done either, I guess.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:28]** These seem to be simple motion sensors.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:30]** Dumb in that sense.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** They're not smart motion sensors.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:34]** They don't have any capability that allows them to connect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:43]** Connect them to your nest or... So in order to discharge this weapon, it was...

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:54]** was wired into the weapon from the motion controller or was it signaled to the weapon?

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** How did it fire?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:55 - 00:25:02]** It sends a signal to the ice carbine to overcharge and to fire a single shot.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:05]** Here's a problem with playing this game with a bunch of engineers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:09]** Now we're all like, tell me the specifics.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** What type of sensor did they use?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** Was it IR or Bluetooth?

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Let's see.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:23]** No, my actual thought was, like, there's no way to override, like, a lot of the mechanisms on a firearm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:33]** No, no, like, there's a mechanism in the game that lets you, like, override a weapon where you use all of your charges at once or whatever the way it works out to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** I agree with that.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:34]** That's fine.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:36]** That's not my contention here.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** Well, I'll say this, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:40]** There's also the technology frequently.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:40]** It's not my contention here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:40 - 00:26:08]** has magic ingrained in it not in the sense where like the weapon is magic it's like some component is literally using magic to help power something else I want to know if the trigger is physically moving when this thing gets tripped or not I think it doesn't matter like if you want it to yes that's what's happening otherwise it's plugged in with a USB and that's what's making it do it like that kind of thing that's just beyond the scope


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:12]** Well, he probably wants to... What are you looking to do, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** I want to steal these.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** I want to be able to make traps later.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:25]** So Kevin and I both want the gun.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** We'll have to figure out a way.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** I'll roll you for it.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** Yeah, I'm down for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:35]** I'm going to take the whatever trigger assembly as well as the motion controller and deactivate it and use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:38]** That just kind of defeats the purpose of Kevin and I rolling over this gun.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:40]** So we really have to figure out what we're going to do with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** I don't care about the gun.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:44]** He's saying he'll remove whatever mechanism was used to make it attract.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** Oh, okay, okay.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:45]** For sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:45]** Recover it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** Yeah.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:47]** Gotcha, gotcha.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** So I'll roll...

**[00:26:49 - 00:27:09]** because that's what i like to do that's how i roll rick just as soon as you raise your hand rick waves waves you on like whatever and then he's focused goes focused back on like clearing the room because there's still two other doors and there might be john am i able to appreciate it um go ahead doctor okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:15]** Can I examine these parts and recover them?

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:18]** Like the motion sensor, the trigger assembly, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:22]** Yeah, so there are really only three parts in the system.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** There's one motion sensor.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** Sorry, two.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** There's the motion sensor and there's the gun.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:34]** Later, if you want to take apart them, figure out how it works, try and be able to learn so you can reproduce that later, that's fine.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** But you can take the motion sensor with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Yes, I want to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:38]** Cool.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Totally fine.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:41]** And then it sounds like Hears has the gun.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:41]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:45]** I'm going to check the cabinet as well just to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:46]** Okay.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** Nico, what are you doing?

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:52]** Nico is just trying to take the gun off and get it to either Hears or Rick, whoever wants it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:53 - 00:28:07]** Can I do any sort of engineering or culture check on the, like, is the motion sensor native to the ship or is it specific to, like, would I know anything about its origin based on its construction?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:08]** Not really.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:13]** Did anybody write their name on the bottom of it so we know who put it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** This is from Star Dreamer 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** There's a heart, and there are a couple initials.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:20]** So somebody loves somebody else.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:23]** No, there's nothing on it indicating that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** Dang, just gave it away without trying to make a joke.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:30]** He just gave it away that it's Lozu and Keeve set us up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** I literally did not mean that.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** I was just telling a joke.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:35]** But maybe it was.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** No, there's nothing on it that you can tell.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** There's no mark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:42]** Is there anything in the cabinet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** Let's do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** Dr. OK, you give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Here's you want to look.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** So give me another perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** Rick wants to check the other two doors for traps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** I'd like to search the room as well.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:58]** 12.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** I'll assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** So here's got a 12.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** I assist.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** Nico, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:09]** Nico is going to roll an engineering check to try to see if he can't take the laser off the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:10]** You could already do that.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:11]** That's fine.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** You don't need to roll for that.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:13]** Yeah.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:16]** If you're trained in engineering, you could do that.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:21]** I rolled an 18 perception again to assist.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** What does a 12 become in that case?

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** 18, 12.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** Nico, are you doing anything else?

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:29]** And Rick, you're rolling an engineering check or a perception check to see if there are any traps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:37]** I was going to check because there's one door probably to the bathroom or whatever and there's another set of doors to something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** No, those are not doors.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** That's just like a desk.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:40]** Those are windows?

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** It's like a console table.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Okay, so there's only one more door to the bathroom.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:46]** Then I'll check that for traps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:49]** Okay, so let's go around, see what you all find.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** Nico, were you making a roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** No, I'm not making a roll.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** I'm just taking off that laser and giving it to Rico.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:56]** Okay.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Damn it, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Rico's a type of copyright printer.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Yeah.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:05]** So, Rick, yeah, you look in.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** There just seems to be a bathroom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** And Rick's going to hold up four fingers.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:12]** All clear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** Here's and Dr. Okay.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** This is where it gets interesting.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** Who went over to the console?

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** I think it was Rick, but maybe Dr. Okay.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** You were near there.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:24]** Rick was there, but he was, he wasn't doing anything with it.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** He was walking past it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** Right.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** Right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** Okay.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** A couple of things.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:31]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:37]** You see what seems to be a,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:38 - 00:31:08]** paper notebook and I am putting it in your journal now one sec boom so you should be able to see that oh it's a ledger of some sort several deposits and withdrawals from different corporations and holding companies


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:11]** Is Dr. OK saying this out loud?

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** Yes.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:16]** Nico's going to say, what's that you're looking at?

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:23]** And he's, he's going to be, he's taken down the artillery laser and he's, and he calls out, by the way, here's Rick.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** You guys want it?

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** You guys want one of these?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:26]** What is it?

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** We already rolled on it.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:28]** Rick takes it.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** I'm sorry.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:29]** Here's takes it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** Here's takes it.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:31]** Yeah.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** That was already done.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:33]** All right.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** So now Nico walks over to where Dr. Okay.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:39]** Is that like, do you mind if I take a, do you mind if I look at that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** Sure.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** All right.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:52]** John, can I roll a culture and profession check to see if I recognize any of the corporations on those?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:53]** Give me one sec.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** I'm going to add it to your journal.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** So it's in your journal now, Nick.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:00]** And yeah, give me a culture check.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:02]** Here's the culture check, John.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:05]** And Will, give me a wisdom check.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:08]** That's an 18 on the culture check.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** 18 on culture?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:13]** Wisdom is plus one, so 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:16]** 18, okay.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:22]** Before I say anything, you two are literally looking at the paper.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:28]** So what are your thoughts for the rest of the players in the audience?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** Nico's going to say it loud for everybody.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:41]** He's just like, well, Dr. Okay, looks like your theory about this being the original Star Dreamer 2 here might be a little bit more plausible now.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:46]** Looks like we got some ship repair reports and looks like we got some financial holdings as well.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:53]** And how interesting for Algiada to be in possession of these papers.

**[00:32:54 - 00:33:01]** So, I'm inclined to try and see who else knows about this.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:05]** This should be the captain's property, and it's not.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** So, let's find out who Algiada's in Kedut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** I wonder...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:13]** Let's find out who Algiata is in cahoots with.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:17]** So let's see if we can get some leverage on them.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:20]** This is the start of something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** What were you going to say, John?

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** Like, what do we learn from this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** Yeah.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** Yeah.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:26]** Because I want to give you that.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** Nico.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:35]** Obviously, there are a couple deposits, transactions, withdrawals into some packed worlds and near space banks.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** Some of them you recognize.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:41]** You're like, oh, yep, I've seen that before.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:43]** Like Abadar Corp Financial Holdings.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** Yep.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:44]** Seen that.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** Bank of Absalom.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** Seen that.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Triaxis Trust.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:50]** Seems like a little local planet.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:53]** Maybe you don't recognize it, but you're like, that's fine.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Voyage Corporation.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:54]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** What is 4LP?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** So this is what your wisdom check gets you.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** You got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:09]** You recall that LP... Slozo... Pal... Palier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:11]** Pahir.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:11]** Pahir?

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** Yes.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:16]** I'm going to add this to everyone's journals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:22]** Seems like... Algeota paid off.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** So is this...

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:47]** yeah is this like so if i'm if i'm reading this correctly these this is her own personal ledger or is this for the ship she was dealing with trust and neck they were in some kind of they were trying because he explained to us that they they were trying to ship out these robots and sell them off or whatever they were trying to do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** So what are we looking at here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:49 - 00:35:03]** Well, I'm looking at something that's emboldened, written, ship repairs, quote-unquote, on her personal ledger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** It's a debt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:07]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:09]** This is the chief of security, right?

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:13]** I want to bring something else to y'all's attention.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:18]** Here's maybe you're somewhat absentmindedly looking.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:21]** Part of your mind is thinking, trying to put clues together.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:26]** The other part of you is just blindly looking when you're shearing fingers.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:26]** Find it.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:32]** There's a small, sleek metal data pad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:38]** Well, here's goes to pick that up and tries to access it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** It is locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** Here's will try to open it.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** Computers check.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** Can we hack it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** You can do.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:49]** Give me a computer check.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** Here's rules.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:52]** Primary access is what we need to get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Ten computers check.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** Yeah.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** Some assistance.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:58]** I rolled really well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** I'll assist on the computer check.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:01]** Assist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:05]** Who is rolling to get in and who is rolling to assist?

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** I'm rolling to assist.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Nick is rolling to assist.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:09]** So that counts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:12]** Kelly, what's your computers?

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:17]** It's plus eight, but I rolled pretty low this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** But you did try and get in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** I did try to get in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** And Will assisted.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:22]** Yes.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** With a 14, right?

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** Because you both assisted.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:36]** And then there's something about that device here is that you just feel so confident that you know the backdoor security into the pad.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:43]** You show Dr. OK, Dr. OK agrees, mirrors that confidence, and then doo-doo, doesn't.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** Doesn't quite work.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:45]** You want to try again?

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:46]** You want to switch?

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** You want somebody else to try?

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Can we try again?

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** I'm down for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** Nothing's happened.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** You can always try again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** There's nothing preventing you from trying again.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:57]** That's true.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** Here's rolls of 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** To assist or to do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:00]** To do it.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** I'll roll to assist.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** I'll roll to assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:04]** Okay.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:04]** Okay.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** That's a 15 plus 6.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** That's a 21 to assist.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** Nice.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** You both assist.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:12]** On 21s, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:14]** There's something about this check.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:21]** Maybe Nico and Dr. OK, you both see the same little thing that Hears was doing wrong in that moment.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:23]** You're like, hey, no, fix this.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:27]** It opens.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:34]** At first, it doesn't seem to be anything suspicious.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:54]** normal it's fine nothing nothing screams out being like my note in case people can't find me but you're scrolling through her messages there's a folder that is password protected


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Now we need to get another access.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:00]** I'm going to try to get into this.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** Grant access.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:02]** I'll assist.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** I will roll to get in.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** I got 20.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:07]** You got 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:11]** Oh, hell yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** I got 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:14]** That's a 16 to assist.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** So that's plus four.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** Rick, what are you thinking during all this?

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:21]** He's kind of standing back.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:23]** The technology stuff is all way over his head.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Okay.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:25]** He's an android.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:29]** And he's just trying to piece together what's going on.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:39]** But he does think that Algiata has some kind of scam of her own going on, but that's not what the case is, unless it's clashing with Lozu and Keeve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:45]** It is also possible that this paper note was planted by whoever set this trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:50]** What was your perception check, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:53]** On the traps was 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:57]** Okay, but you didn't roll one on the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** No, do you want me to?

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** If you want.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:01]** 12.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** My perception check rolls are terrible today.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** Yeah?

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** I rolled a 12.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** You rolled a 12, got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:09]** Pass your protective message.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** That's weird.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** It's weird, right?

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:16]** For somebody to have a password-protected folder on their data pad?

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** I don't know.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:18]** Who knows?

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** No lifestyle shaming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:28]** I mean, if I was a chief security officer, I would probably have a password-protected folder with...

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:34]** Some sort of dossier documents on crew members or passengers, perhaps.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:36]** Okay.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** It's not out of the ordinary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:45]** I don't think it's too out of the ordinary for a security officer to have a password protected folder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:49]** However, let's take a look.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** Let's see what's inside.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:53]** I mean, she's gone after all.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** Presumably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** He just looks into the folder.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** He's looking.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** What does he see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:13]** A set of messages between Algiana and a no-reply contact in the city of Maro on Akiton.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:39]** conversation you start scrolling through the thread it's mostly innocuous mostly talking about the memories of an an uncle are but who's looking through these messages i think it's nico here's and dr okay yes yep okay give me a sense motive check all of us yeah uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** What is my sense motive?

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:49]** I don't... I mean, are we all rolling... Natural 20 plus 4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** We're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:50]** Nice.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:54]** Are we rolling collectively?

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** Oh, I got a natural 20 minus 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** I got a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** Oh, you got a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** I got a 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** You were all rolling individually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:02]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Because you're all reading messages.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** You're not talking necessarily out loud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:08]** I don't know the vernacular too well, I don't think.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** with my 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:14]** It's alright, because it sounds like Nico and here's what you get, and Rick, you actually maybe were peering over the shoulder.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:18]** Maybe you understood it in this cold way.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** Here's what you get.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** Here's got a 3.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Okay.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** You say it with such optimism.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** None of this makes sense to you.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:27]** You say it with such optimism.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** I'm not very good at sensing.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** I got a 3.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** I'm just like, everything looks great.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** Fine.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:38]** So Nico and Rick, in your minds, you're piecing it together.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:45]** Seems like there's almost like a sinister undertone to the messages.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:48]** The memories are...

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:52]** records something.

**[00:41:52 - 00:42:01]** So the memories are records of something nefarious that the no reply address would like to see.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:16]** Algiada could seemingly provide these memories if no reply ensures that Uncle R has a permanent new home.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:25]** And Algiata writes that she will, quote, take care of Uncle R's old place once he's gone.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:27]** All right.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:30]** So give me a wisdom check.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** A wisdom check?

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:31]** Yeah.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:32]** Go ahead, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:37]** Nico's going to kind of voice a theory out loud here.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:39]** He's just like, we need to be careful.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:45]** This artillery laser that was pointed at us, we might have been meant to find all of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:47 - 00:43:11]** for them to cast the blame on us we need to we need to find everything the only one that has an r in their name what did you see what happened what do you find yeah what are we what are we rolling i don't understand i can't make this out the only person with an r in their name from the ship's roster so far is uh captain rameem is that what you say is rick or is kevin

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:14]** That's what I'm thinking about as Kevin, but Rick will say that.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:19]** Is it possible that Uncle R is referring to the captain?

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:22]** Nick, what did you get on your wisdom check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** I got a 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:30]** Nico, you realize... I got a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:31]** Okay.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:33]** And Dr. Okay.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:39]** Yeah, Uncle R is the captain's first initial... Yes!


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:40]** Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** That reminds me of that.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:43]** Huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** Oh, I thought you were confirming it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:49]** No, but they had the same thought that Rick already had.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:43:52 - 00:44:01]** And seems like you can surmise that Uncle R's old place is probably the Chimera.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:17]** So it could be that these two participants were maybe plotting something sinister against Uncle R upon the Chimera's return to the Pact world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** Nico's going to joke out loud.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** Talk about a Chimera.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:25]** The ship used to be the Star Dreamer.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** Now it's the Chimera.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** Two ships in one.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** Okay.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** That's what a chimera is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:38]** It's like Darth Vader.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** Literally father.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:42]** So what are you thinking?

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** What do you guys think?

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** What do you say?

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:49]** Nico says aloud, it's clear that the captain's in danger.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:54]** Now, the better question is, is it in our best interest to save him?

**[00:44:54 - 00:45:02]** Or are we better served going after the relic and finding more information on these perpetrators before it goes cold?

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** The captain may or may not be dead already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:09]** The livelihood of the ship is more important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:12]** Yeah, I would agree with Rick here.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** Finding the relic's not going to go anywhere.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:21]** Well, the ship is, you know, in motion and no one's getting off of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:25]** Yeah, you're currently stuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:29]** I mean, the captain... We could all die here before we find the relic.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** Let's put it that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** Algiata may or may not be off this ship already.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:36]** There's no power to this ship at the moment.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:41]** Algiata may have just upped and left after getting what she needs or killing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** But here's the thing, Nick.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** So, like...

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:53]** Yes, Algiata, and this, it's like, Nico didn't get all this information up front, but, like, Algiata and Trusinac are definitely involved in something.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** Are you saying this is right?

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:58]** No, this is Kevin talking as a group, too.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:06]** So Algiata and Trusinac are definitely, like, involved in some kind of quote-unquote plan, which is probably taking over the ship and killing off Captain Rameem.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:13]** But at the same time, we know that Lozu and Keeve are up to something.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:19]** so we don't necessarily know that like, I'll jot is necessarily the bad guy in this situation.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:26]** Currently, like we're not saying she's good and she might be trying to kill the captain, but it sounded like, and I can't remember who was the one backing out of that.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:28]** Was that trust neck or, or I'll jot is saying like, let's not do it.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:31]** We can consult our, wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** Well, I don't know.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** Cause I wasn't in on that.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:35]** Like here's, and I were not in on that conversation.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** That's the first time I'm hearing about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:38 - 00:47:01]** well i think we told you about it before oh yeah okay yeah well okay so quote this is episode six if you want to go back and listen to it uh rick and dr okay over here um algiata and trust neck speaking the the vast trust neck says stick to the plan and algiata says if we follow the plan we will get nothing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:31]** you know I like that you're the one who's saying this because it kind of makes sense that Rick has this like perfect hardcore memory yeah perfect memory perfect memory and I believe I did I've read that before in voices as if Rick was just like replaying yeah like the audio so you could I don't know what episode that was that I did that in yeah so yeah okay we'll do so in this conversation Rick will say like it's possible that Algiada is not the person that we believe she is currently I'm not saying she is innocent but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:33]** Let me replay something for you.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:36]** And then he clicks and it says, stick to the plan.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:40]** If we follow the plan, we'll get nothing.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:53]** And then he comes back to his regular voice and says, that was Algiata and the Vesk, Trusinik, who implemented Keeve as an aggressor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:56]** Well, let's kind of put the pieces together here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:56 - 00:48:03]** We gave Trustneck over to Lozu, who is having some kind of relationship with Keeve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:04]** Exactly.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:10]** So we gave Trustneck a potential agitator over to someone else that gave us a key card.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:13]** And while we're hunky-dory, we certainly don't trust her either.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:19]** Now, the bigger question is, let's think about everything that's in play at the moment.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:33]** We have a relic in play, a captain whose life is in danger, and some hitherto unrecognized disabled ship and some hitherto unconfirmed assailants.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:35]** Now, what's our play?

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:41]** How do we make sure that we get these guys and make sure we secure as much information?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** I say we secure the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:44]** Kill everyone and take the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:49]** With all the nonsense going on, we probably should be in charge, to be honest.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:54]** Let's find a way to take control of the bridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:55 - 00:49:15]** all right well we'll need to restore power first and then we'll need control of the the first thing i would say we recommend we do is we go and we restore power to the ship then we're going to need control of the security system just for the listeners sake there was this running conversation in our like slack stuff


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:23]** for the last week, jokingly saying that the easiest way out of all of this is to just commandeer the ship, hijack it, and make it our own.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** I genuinely think that's true.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:30]** Yeah, there was like this Among Us, quote-unquote Among Us game references about just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:53]** ejecting everybody everyone's an imposter oh we're not gonna jack we're gonna but yes that was a discussion we now it's actually coming to play i love it too yeah take control and interview them and understand what's happening but we need we need to have control of the situation to do that best i think so


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** From a pirate?

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** That's awfully peaceful of you here.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** I expected more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:02]** Look, I... You expect me to just mindlessly toss people out?

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:06]** I also have a brain and want to do the thing that's best for us.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** I want that relic.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** I want to get us to where we need to go.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** And we got to solve this problem today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** I wish to go to the pack worlds.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Eventually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** Yeah, yeah, same.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:23]** Well, in order to get to all those objectives, the first thing we'll need to do is to restore power to the ship.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:23]** Hmm.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:25]** Then I say we do it.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:29]** Clearly the agitators want this ship disabled with the power off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:31]** Perhaps there's more booby traps as well.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** We should be very careful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** Let's go restore power to the ship.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:38]** Then we'll worry about the bridge.

**[00:50:39 - 00:51:03]** should we i'm down should we secure the captain though i believe we should secure the captain and check the bridge that is the controlling point for the ship i mean we're already up here captain may or may not already be dead i don't think we should risk our lives for an unknown they're either holding them hostage or they've already killed them let's not go rush off to a grave the same way let's have control of the situation


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:06]** Sorry, a little Navy background stuff, too.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:08]** The bridge is where you control the ship from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:14]** Isn't there a power core, though, that I'm assuming that they may have shut down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:25]** Yes, and as an engineering person off of a submarine, you can control the ship from the back, but it's very difficult to do and not easy, and it would take overriding a ton of systems and a full crew to do it.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:31]** So I think the bridge is a central point where whoever's in control of the bridge is controlling the ship.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:34]** Whether or not you have power is a secondary problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:34]** Yes.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** I mean, we have backup power and life support right now.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:47]** So I wouldn't want that to fall into the wrong hands while we're on a wild goose chase to restore power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:52]** Why don't we then secure the captain and... Yeah, take the bridge, secure the captain.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:54]** And then ask them what they know.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** Maybe they do know something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:00]** In any case, I don't think the captain should be a priority.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:03]** The captain is going to be either dead or held hostage.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:08]** If we go with the mindset of freeing him, we risk compromising our own objectives.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:10]** And to be honest... Which are what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Yeah, our objective is to survive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:18]** Our objective is to survive, but also to make sure we get the most out of this situation.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:21]** Because there's clearly something for us to profit here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:24]** That is your objective, not our objective.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** It's going to be in your best interest, too.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** And Nico winks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:34]** Just like you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** I want that relic.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:42]** But to get a place of power, I think I think we need to like we need to get the people that are in power and understand what they know.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** You know, we don't need them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:48]** We can take the Chimera ourselves.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:51]** I don't trust anybody else in this ship right now, aside from the three people on this ship.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** I don't trust anyone either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:55]** I think we can take it if we take the captain.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** They've convinced me.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** This is good.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** You want to at least look at the bridge?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** Let's go to the bridge.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** Let's go to the bridge.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:07]** I'm just saying, let's not have our hearts set on saving the captain.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** If it's convenient, let's do it.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** That's not what I'm trying to do.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** I just want to secure the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** I don't think anybody actually said that.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** Yeah, no one...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:17]** Secure meaning either his living body or his corpse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** I just want to get out of here.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** All right, let's go.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:21]** Alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:23]** So what's the plan?

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** I would concur with Dr. Roque.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:27]** He just starts to walk towards the bridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** Dude.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Okay, so he just walks out.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:32]** Nico's going to pause one more time.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** He's going to ask everybody else.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:36]** He's like, are we all stocked up on ammo for this fight?

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** If it comes down to a shootout, are we ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** Do you need a rest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** Have you lost your senses, Nico?

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** I mean, he's almost dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:59]** Like, to be honest, some spineless fool decided to shoot me full of coal, and I'd much rather warm up before I go into any type of heated firefight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:04]** What does that mean?

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Dr. O'Kane is just confused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** What, you want to go in the hot tub or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** With those goblins?

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** Are you kidding me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:18]** They probably pooped in that thing.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:21]** We could also attempt to heal Nico again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:26]** But the healing also restores the stamina, too.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** Like, resting restores stamina, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:29]** Yeah.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** That's true.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** Can't you just spend a resolve point and do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** Can I, John?

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** Yeah.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** You can always spend a resolve point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:44]** If someone wants to... Doctor, okay, if you want to give me a med shot here, I can spend a resolve point.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** I already did, and I failed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** I can't do it again.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** Oh, really?

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:49]** You can't?

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:55]** No, I don't think it... The rules are you can't take 20 to do a medicine check.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:58]** You can't do... 10 minutes of uninterrupted rest.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** To spend a resolve point.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:26]** yeah to get your stamina back up to your normal maximum and you don't get any hit points though right nope you need to sleep or get yeah uh so get healing to get hit points or nick if you spend a resolve take 10 then you'll have full stamina so that gives me what 10 hit points yeah so you're down you're down four no i'm down six

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** But what's your stamina?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:31]** My stamina is six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:31]** Okay.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:33]** And then your hit points is eight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** My hit points are ten.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** Okay.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** He did 12 damage to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** Yeah, you have four left.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:42]** You have four hit points.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** No stamina.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** Okay.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:49]** So you'll just have to rest for a night's worth, maybe?

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:49]** Yeah.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:50]** Six, seven hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:54]** Well, if you rest a night, you will gain the number of points equal to your level, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:55]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:56 - 00:56:00]** And you gain all your stamina points back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:02]** So I get six stamina points and one health point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** If you rest.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:07]** And you wouldn't use a resolve point, which can also be used to stabilize yourself.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:08]** So what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:13]** I suggest we hunker down within this room.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:17]** You guys can cuddle up on the bed if you really need to take a rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** I do not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:26]** I know for you androids, cuddling is something you do when you're charging sockets, but for humans, we don't cuddle up unless we've done some nooky here.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** You understand?

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:34]** I'm very confused by this person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** Which person?

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** Oh.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:39]** Okay.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:41]** We were like, we all like cuddling.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:41]** What is wrong with him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:49]** So you all are talking about staying in this room for 10 minutes or like overnight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:51]** 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** So you're going to spend a resolve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** I can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:54]** Yeah.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:56]** Okay.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:56]** 10 minutes.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:58]** 10 minutes and burn a resolve point.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** That's not that bad.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** So you all come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:05]** I'm going to put a motion detector on the hallway.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:05]** Okay.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** Okay.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** And hook it up to my data pad.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:13]** Do I need to roll like a computer's check to do that or engineering?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:19]** I would roll an engineering check and then a computer's to hook it up to your data pad because you're going to wirelessly hook it up.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** So that's going to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:25]** So I got a 19 on my engineering.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:26]** Engineering.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** That was good.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:34]** 25 on my computer's chart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** Okay.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:41]** So you're trying to manipulate the control module of the motion sensor to do what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:48]** To give you an alert when you... Can I detect if somebody passes by versus...

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** comes and stays.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** The question is, does it continue to trip then?

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** It's either on or off.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:58]** Is it on the entire time that there is motion and as soon as there's no longer motion, it turns off?

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:01]** Or is it just a one-time beep, there was something?

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:05]** Typically, motion sensors will stay active until there's no longer motion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** Then it will stay active until there's no longer motion.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:09]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** Okay.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** Here's a little stand guard by its door.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:15]** I just want to see if somebody passes by while we're in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:18]** So you're standing out for the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:18]** Yes.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:19]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** Rick, are you in?

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** Yeah.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** Rick will take the guard.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** He's going to lean up against the door.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:29]** Okay.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:42]** As you're standing there, you realize maybe that you didn't see before there's a photo on the console.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:47]** You're like, oh, why didn't I see that before?

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:50]** Maybe Nico walks over, picks up the photo.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** It's a hollow picture.

**[00:58:54 - 00:59:00]** It's a young, Rhyphorian man in some sort of... Will you please describe Rhyphorian for us?

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** Algiata is Rhyphorian.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:04]** Humanoid, tipped ears.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:11]** So they're from the planet where the planet has interminably long seasons.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:16]** like decades long winters and then decades long summers because of his orbit.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:20]** They historically have been paired with like dragons.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:25]** So, uh, they, the Skyfire Legion are Rhyforian.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:28]** Um, and they have like bonds that they share with dragon kin.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:32]** So half the planet, half, let's call it half is ruled by dragons.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:35]** Half of them are ruled by the Rhyforians.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** There's kind of an uneasy truce at the moment.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:40]** And, uh,

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:50]** From looking at the picture, you're like, this is probably a dig site on Triaxis.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:52]** It's like an archaeological dig site.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:59]** And the man in the picture bears a familial resemblance to Algiada.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:04]** But what might be of more interest...

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:08]** is somebody standing in the background.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** Their arms are crossed.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:13]** They're watching the young Rhyphorian dig.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:25]** And that somebody seems to be a younger, without a goatee, Professor Broden Benjamin.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** What?

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:29]** No!

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** What?

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:32]** The plot thickens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:39]** Hey guys, Niko Orion here, and I'm at the end of my rope.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:53]** I've watched my best friend get assassinated, I'm on the run, I've been attacked by space lice, shot in the chest with an ice carbine, and now I find that Algiata is plotting against her own capture of Mien's life!

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:58]** Now, if I don't find the truth soon, well, I'm gonna lose it.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:04]** That being said, I want to give a special thank you to Paizo for running the three full conspiracy.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** You guys are legends.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:11]** And I want to give a special thank you to all those who come together to produce this beautiful podcast.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:13]** Until next We'll Save Wednesday.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:14]** See ya.


## Speaker_0
