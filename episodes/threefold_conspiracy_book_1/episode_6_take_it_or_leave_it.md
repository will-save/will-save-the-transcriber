## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Last time on Will Save.

**[00:00:03 - 00:00:07]** The fight against the space lice has finally come to an end.

**[00:00:07 - 00:00:13]** With the final flash of a magic missile, the last of these unsavory critters has met a premature end.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:18]** As our adventurers finished off this untimely infestation, they had to take extra care.

**[00:00:18 - 00:00:23]** Upon each of their deaths, the space slice exploded into a burning acid substance.

**[00:00:24 - 00:00:32]** Wreck 19 had to keep on scraping off a particularly stubborn space slice, while Hears and Nico continued to sharpshoot the space slice off their compatriots.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:33]** Dr.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:39]** O.K., after garnering the attention of the crew, returned to provide biochemical inhibitors to the space slice.

**[00:00:39 - 00:00:44]** With our characters routinely finding trouble, will they ever find a moment to rest?

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:48]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:56]** there are a few things more personal and creative and indicative of who you are as a person in life than two things your favorite candy and your toppings on pizza


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:00]** Oh, my God.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** That got Kev right from the beginning.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:08]** Every time we start, you're so ominous and mysterious about it.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:10]** You're like, there are things in this universe.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Like candy.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:16]** And pizza toppings.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:18]** No, candy is a very important topic to me.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** Candy is important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:22]** And I dedicate the intro to this episode six.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:25]** Thank you for tuning in this week to candy.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** All candy in general.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** All candy in general.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** Except black licorice.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:30]** No.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:34]** But particularly zero bars.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Those are my favorite.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:37]** Shout out to all you zero bar lovers.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** What the heck is that?

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Just like one person.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Yeah, no one knows.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:40]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:50]** To Kev's point, though, it would be like if we had the trailer for a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away from Star Wars.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** What's that?

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:56]** And it would be like the next thing you saw, candy.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** Such an iconic moment.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** And then candy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:04]** Zero does look like a candy bar that would be in Star Wars, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** It looks good.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** I mean, thank you for that segue, Kelly.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** In a vending machine on the Death Star.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:11]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** That was great.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:16]** I will say, though, that black licorice is like pineapple on pizza.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** That is like an equivalent.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:21]** Because there are people who love it and will fight you for it.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** I'm just going to props that you tied the two together.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:25]** The majority of the world knows it's wrong and terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:30]** You know how you have to play those dumb wedding games during a reception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:32]** Oh, I thought you meant like when you're dealing with your wife.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:35]** I never have to play those dumb wedding games because I love my wife.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** We're not talking about my marriage.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** I'm talking about my marriage.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:42]** This is not one of those podcasts where we talk about relationships.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** This is not one of those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** I know what you mean, though.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** Those ones at the reception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:56]** My wife is first-generation Dutch, and it's a cultural thing, black licorice.

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:04]** And so they made me eat a bunch of salty black licorice during the reception.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Salt?

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** And I wanted to die.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Yeah.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** They're called droppies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:10]** They made you?

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Like you were required to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:13]** Yeah, it was like part of the game because I like lost parts of it.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** Wow, that's messed up.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** The punishment was to eat droppies.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** Wow.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** It looks like you should have just won part of the game there.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:23]** They didn't just make you do like JÃ¤germeister shots?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** I would have preferred that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** Yeah, that's basically what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** I had to eat droppies.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:31]** Can I just say that I feel like this music is not good.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** I feel like this is better music, waiting music.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** I'm just going to change it.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** This is probably better, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** A little bit better?

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:41]** My grandmother always had a candy dish on top of her.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:44]** She had this like old radio stand fireplace thing.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** That takes a lot of explaining on its own.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:53]** But the candy dish though, it was always just out of reach for children until I was tall enough.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:59]** And then I just, but the problem was that when I got tall enough, the candy in it turned to black licorice.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:01]** Oh.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:24]** so it was starburst and stuff when i was little and then once i was big enough to reach it she knew she put out the candy that she liked so i wouldn't take it that's smart that's an interesting strategy yeah wow my grandmother yeah she was a smart woman yeah yeah she picked up on it my favorite candy though is is reese's peanut butter cups i mean yeah you can't go wrong


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:26]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** Nick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** Reese's are awesome.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** Sour Belts.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** That's Nick.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:32]** I'm going to throw that ring in there.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** I'm going to throw that in the ring right there.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:37]** Sour Belts, whether it's green apple, watermelon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** Is Sour Belts a brand name?

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:44]** Because I think about just like the sour strips of candy that are basically titled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** Yeah, that's what it is.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** I think they are brand agnostic.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** I think they are brand agnostic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** How do we all feel about Haribo gummies?

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** Sorry, Kelly.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** I love Haribos.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:59]** Also Dutch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** What is a Haribo gummy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** It's just the brand.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** Haribo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** They're like the gummy bear.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:09]** I have some organic gummy bears right now that are okay.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:09]** I don't know.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:12]** Gummy bears don't have a whole lot of flavor to them, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:14]** They're mostly just gelatin.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:19]** Bouncing here and there and everywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** That's okay.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:25]** If you pull any of those late 80s, early 90s cartoons out, then I'm on board.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:28]** You're on board.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:32]** That solves our next conversation topic, which was late 80s, 90s cartoons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** We just skipped pizza toppings.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:34]** We did.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** We don't have to do pizza right now.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:41]** They just brought Darkwing Duck back.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** Oh, yeah, they did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:46]** Have you guys watched the new DuckTales?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** You had to wait for the theme to go through, Kevin.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** Then now you can talk about Darkwing Duck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:56]** I know.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:59]** Have you guys watched the new DuckTales?

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:01]** Well, the new DuckTales is amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** Darkwing Duck!

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:06]** All the DuckTales are amazing, but the new one is a really good remake for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:11]** But they brought Darkwing Duck into the new DuckTales.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** What?

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:14]** And reintroduced them.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:16]** Darkwing Duck was one of my favorite shows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:19]** How come I'm more into kids shows now than I'm old?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:21]** Because they're your kids shows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:24]** Because you realize all the humor that they put in that was only for adults.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:28]** Because it's the only form of creativity still left in either TV or film.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** Everything else is like a remake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:33]** That's not fair.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:36]** Alternatively, you could listen to a podcast like we'll save.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:38]** That's one form of entertainment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:39]** Yeah, I guess so.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:42]** Well, I said TV or film.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:44]** Podcast is not either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** You're right.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:53]** So the question is, do we do an update on favorite pizza toppings and open that big can of worms?

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:57]** Or do we talk about our new house rule that we've decided?

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** New house rule.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** I like the house rule.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Why not both?

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:02]** Why not both?


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:08]** Okay, we are not getting a discussion about which pizzas are okay or not, because that is a fight all on its own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** Favorite pizza topping?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:15]** Unpopular opinion, white pizza with bacon and mushrooms.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:20]** Unpopular opinion, white pizza with chicken and sriracha and blue cheese.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** That sounds cool.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** With garlic.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:25]** I like jalapenos and spicy peppers on them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:27]** Yeah, so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:27]** And butter.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:31]** Sorry, you guys are listing off all the things I just won't put on anything.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** One is jalapenos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** Kevin, I served it to you.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** Mushrooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:38]** That's always why whenever we're together, we always get two pizzas.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:43]** One mystery pizza that we all eat, and then one, like, pepperoni pizza.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:45]** Yeah, because Kev thinks water is spicy.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** Everything is spicy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** Everything is spicy.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:53]** But I will say that... Prosciutto ham.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:53]** Okay, Kev.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** Artificial crab meat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** On pizza?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** It's just like a white fish.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** Yeah, it's like cod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** It's so good on pizza.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** You really got me there, Kev.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:07]** I was not expecting you to say that.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:09]** I would rather eat anchovies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** We were just like, oh, let's make our own pizza tonight.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** What toppings do we have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:18]** Anchovies are good, so I would try artificial crab meat.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:21]** Nick, we didn't hear what your favorite was.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:21]** On pizza?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:22]** Yeah.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** Oh, crap.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:24]** All right.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:33]** I think it's got to be my chicken, bacon, chicken, bacon, mushroom and garlic and onion Alfredo pizza.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** That's true.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** So all white pizzas.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Fair.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:37]** Yeah.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** Fair.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** All what pizzas?

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** White pizzas.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** What's a white pizza?

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** No tomato sauce?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:46]** Everyone in New York is going to unfollow us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:49]** Yeah, we're going to lose a lot of people.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** Everybody in Italy is going to be like, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:53 - 00:10:00]** Recently, I've been eating more marinara pizzas with some red pepper flakes, some bacon, pepper.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:04]** I was saying for my crab one, we use marinara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:06]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:28]** what so white pizza is a white sauce blank yeah it's like white wine sauce yeah just just no sauce or frankly no like tomato sauce could be some just like olive oil or whatever pesto even oh pesto classic pesto is really good so let's get into the house real real quick


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:34]** For every pepperoni you put on your pizza, you have to do five push-ups.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** That's it.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:39]** You get a plus five for every pepperoni that you eat.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:41]** So imagine a game.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** You're laughing.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** You're listening to us play.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** One of us makes a joke.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** It's a pun.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:51]** You're like, wow, that was a really good pun.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** We here at We'll Save, we agree with you.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:57]** Or maybe we don't.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:59]** Maybe we think it wasn't a good pun.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** But that's the question.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:05]** So when one of us makes a pun, we're all going to have a little quorum.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** I don't know if we have enough people to make a quorum.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:10]** We're all going to have a little quorum.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** Decide, was that a good pun?

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** Was that not a good pun?

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** I don't know.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:25]** And if we all agree, then that person gets a plus one to whatever roll damage that they want to of their own.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:26]** Right.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** But you could transfer.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** Could be a skill.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:29]** Could be a skill.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** Could be damage.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Could be whatever.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:32]** Could be whatever.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:33]** Saving throw.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** A will save even perhaps.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** Hashtag will save.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** Hashtag will save.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:37]** Hashtag will save.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:41]** And it is transferable to somebody.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** You can hand it off to somebody.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:49]** The question is, what is this called?

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:53]** Nick thought of the term punishment, but then- No.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** No, I did not.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:55]** That was Kevin.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** Kevin thought of it.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:57]** That was all Kevin.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:57]** My bad.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** My bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:58]** All right.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** My bad.

**[00:11:59 - 00:11:59]** Wow.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:00]** Sorry.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** I need my credit when I give.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:01]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:03]** This room got real hot.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** My bad.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:04]** Okay.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** So this is a meeting.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:06]** Okay.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:09]** So Kev thought of punishment, but what are we going to call it?

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** What if-


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:15]** What if we spell it punishment, but like mint is M-I-N-T because it's not negative then?

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** Because you like mint candy?

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:17]** Is that the tie-in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:21]** It's like a little bit of candy, a little bit of punny.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** Back to the candy conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** A little bit of candy, a little bit of punny, a little bit of best of both worlds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:25]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** Pun plus one?

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:26]** I don't know.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** What are we doing?

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:27]** Punishment.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** One pun?

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:28]** Pun one?

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:33]** That would seriously be a great brand for mint.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:37]** We can't call it a big pun because rest in peace, is he still around?


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:38]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** Big pun.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:43]** Yes, big pun is rest in peace, big pun.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** He passed away in the year 2000.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** Big pun.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** Rest in peace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** Yeah.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** I like the term punishment.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** I don't think it necessarily needs to be negative.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** I think it's just funny.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** Punishment it is.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** Punishment.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:01]** Kevin said it's punishment, so there it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:07]** No, I mean like you said yeah, Kelly was like yeah, Nick liked it, Will liked it, I liked it.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:07]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:33]** we all just cheers and with that and with that do i get one for my review review the pun for us what was it playback yeah because you were like oh rick to rick got two points or whatever and i like said i will rick to fire


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:36]** Ah, that's right.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** Rictify.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** We got to vote on this.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** Rictify.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:39]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** What is the vote?

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:43]** I was Rictify.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** I'm sorry.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:49]** As Rick, I'm going to have to give that a no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** Oh.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:50]** Wow.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** Rick is salty about it.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** Salty.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:53]** Salty.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:58]** And salt is, you know, harmful to Dr. O'Kane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:02]** Apparently I made a pun about the wind and it blew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** Fine.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** That gets it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:09]** Now we're voting on two different ones.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:09]** All right.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** Just one.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** Rictify.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** I'm going to give a thumbs up on that one.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:16]** So we got one thumbs down, one thumbs up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** It's already three thumbs up.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** Nick Votai.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** So you get a plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** You get a punishment.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Congratulations, Will.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** You got a punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:25]** Well deserved.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:26]** Will deserved.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:32]** See, this is what I was worried about.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** We're just going to look for puns everywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:39]** I think we have to have, like, a debounce method on this.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** Max of one per game.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:41]** Yeah.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** It could be, like, inspiration.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** Yeah, like, you can only have it once.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** You can't get more of it.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Yeah, you can't get more.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** Okay.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** All right.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:53]** Well, with that said, let's jump in.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:56]** Let's talk quickly about what happened.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** You jump on the ship.

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** You go to your rooms.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:05]** You hear some videos, watching videos about the Chimera.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:09]** You get a notification to come to the galley.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:20]** There are refreshments for you as an apology from the captain and the crew for the conflict, encounter, whatever you want to call it, that happened in the docking bay.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:28]** While you're there, you meet Keeve Cadenz, and you get to sit down for a moment with Professor Benjamin.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:32]** He's showing this cube, drops the cube.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:43]** Asteroid lice that were kept inside are now running, milling about the galley and angry at being trapped.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** So they attack you.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:54]** And over the course of two hours, give or take two episodes, you all handle them rather smartly.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:59]** You did some pretty awesome stuff, including Dr. OK giving them a mixture of cocktails.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:08]** Here's Never Missing with a magic missile and Rick shooting him and Nico just blastering away like a sharpshooting.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:11]** Trying to think of a western.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** Clint Eastwood.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** Clint Eastwood, yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Sure, sure, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** And with that, Dr.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** O.K., you let Song know.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:21]** You said, hey, Song, you might want to come check this out.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:22]** Key's in there.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:23]** Song comes in.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:30]** Last episode, we just ended where the lice, they were all dead.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** So I'm going to go to rule 20.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:36]** I'm going to bring you guys back over to the big map.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:41]** If you go to the center, you can see Dr. Okay, you're standing next to one.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** Rick, you're in the middle of the room.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:54]** Nico, here's the slightly injured professor sitting at the table that you were originally at, littered with asteroid lice all around.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:59]** As soon as that last asteroid lice explodes...

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:02]** Song looks over.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:06]** They survey the room, look around.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:10]** I don't know who's responsible.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:17]** For this, I have, it seems our guest here is injured.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:21]** But they kind of gesture over to the professor.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:24]** The professor is just looking down.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:27]** He looks over and he says, I'm mostly all right.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** I think I'll be all right.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:33]** I might just lay down a bit or go.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:41]** And Song cuts him off and says, I've asked for Lozu to come check in with you.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:46]** Maybe she can come in here and walk you or what?

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:49]** The professor says, I'm just going to go to my room.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:52]** I think I can walk.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:56]** And so he starts to kind of slowly ease himself up.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:00]** And Song says, all right, let me know if you need anything else.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** I'll come check in on you soon.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Keeve.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:06]** I don't care what you do with the bugs here.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** I don't care if you throw them out the airlock.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** I don't care if you throw them in the incinerator.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:11]** Whatever.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** Just hurry.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** I've called Lozu.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:15]** I'm supposed to be serving supper here soon.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:20]** This was supposed to be just a sort of refreshing chat.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:24]** And Keeve, they look super kind of sheepish.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:27]** And they close their eyes and...

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Sure, Song.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:33]** Just let me get some gloves or something.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** And they start to kind of look around.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:38]** Song turns to the four of you and says, Thank you.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** I'm going to go back into the kitchen.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** Doctor, okay, right?

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** Thank you for letting me know.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:48]** I will make sure that your dinner tonight is excellent beyond compare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** I'm so sorry for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:51]** Please.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** Without salt, yes, of course, of course, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:55]** Don't let me catch any salt on here.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:58]** You'll see what... No, I don't know.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** I say nothing like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** Are you sassing me?

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** No, I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:04]** No, but I am quite serious about the salt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** I definitely understand.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:16]** And you can see beneath their android exterior, you know, they do have that flat affectation, but even so, you can tell that song, they're trying to keep it together.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:21]** They definitely get salty, for lack of a better word, and can get very upset.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:25]** And so they turn around, they start to walk in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:31]** Nico's going to call in after him before they head back in and say, just make sure to bring me my whiskey.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:35]** I asked for it over five, ten minutes ago before I started shooting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** Absolutely.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:41]** Yes, I believe you'll find it, if you use your eyes, on the table.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:43]** He kind of says under his breath, like on the table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:44]** The table that's not there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:49]** The table that doesn't have food in it because I didn't bring it over from the small amount.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:56]** And it's at that point that the door closes behind Song and they are back in the cavity.

**[00:19:56 - 00:20:24]** hear you keev keev looks over and he says thank you so so much for your help i i don't know what i would have done without any of you look look song was right i i i need to clean it up um i'll clean up the mess on the floor and and the chairs um i'll i'll get it looking perfect but i i hate to ask could i just get even just one of you to help me bring the remains of the bugs down to the incinerator

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** in the engine room.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** It won't take long.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** That's it.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** And then you can rest.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:30]** It doesn't need to be all of you.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** I can find a way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:38]** I will assist in disposing of these highly caustic creatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:39]** Thank you.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:52]** Rick swings his artillery rifle or laser behind his shoulder, tucks it underneath his trench coat, and he just looks at Keeve and says, I will assist you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:52 - 00:21:01]** Nico's going to plop down, sit down, and he's going to pick up his whiskey glass and he's going to be like, I've been waiting to nurse this for at least 30 minutes.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Sorry, no can do.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** Is that Nico's accent?

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** This accent has changed.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** Nico, where did you get that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:09]** Yeah, I thought he was Han Solo-ish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:11]** Wait, really?

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** Damn it, I forget my accent.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** It's all right, that happens.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** It's okay.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** All right, this is Nico's new accent from now on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:25]** Nico's really trying hard to fit in.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:27]** Nico's really trying to fit in.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:29]** Nico's sus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:33]** Nico's sus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:38]** For anybody who doesn't know, Among Us is a video game and sus is short for suspect.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:39]** It's an imposter type game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** It takes place on a starship as well.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:42]** Yes, it does.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:43]** People can be ejected.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** Ejected.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** Emergency meeting!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** Ejected.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:58]** Here's we'll sit down right next to Nico at that table and just kind of like exhale like, he's not going anywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:59 - 00:21:59]** Okay.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** I'm going to have some of that whiskey too.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** All right.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:05]** Well, Keeve looks over at conveniently Dr. Okay and Rick.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** Thank you for helping.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** I really appreciate it.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:12]** Here, just let's, I think by now they're fine.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:15]** And you look over and the steam has stopped rising.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:23]** Maybe, Dr. O'Kate, you recall from your check that the caustic remains are only for maybe a minute or so.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:26]** It's not, you know, they're safe to handle now.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:36]** But nonetheless, Keeve walks over, opens a cabinet near the table and says, just in case, hands out some gloves, you know.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:40]** Some of the yellow ones that you get at like Target, you know, that are like really big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:42]** These don't really fit me, but okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** You're right.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** Let me see if I can get something else.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:50]** Let's just get a buddy bag for these vermin.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:53]** And they go over and they grab a smaller bag.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:55]** Because these things are pretty large.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** Again, they're, like, three feet by a foot wide.

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** They can probably fit one in a bag.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** Some, like, hefty bags.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** Like the ones that hold, like, 13 gallons, right?

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:07]** And the scented ones with the lavender.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** So it smells really nice when you open it up.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** You know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:13]** Smells like the swamp of Pabuck.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:14]** Pabuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:17]** Here, just follow me.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:20]** We'll go down real quick.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:20]** Thank you again.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** Thank you so much.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:25]** And starts to walk out the door.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:34]** So Keeve, they turn the corner and they start walking down the main hall that passes by your rooms.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:42]** Turns back and just says, There are multiple ways to get down to the engine, but I think it's probably faster if we just go up here.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:42]** There's this...

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:44]** Literal unsafe there.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:52]** I don't know how much you've been in or around near engines, but happy to talk you through it or show you a bit.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:56]** But just want to make sure that I respect your time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:56]** They're so nice.

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:00]** Why did we go the long way, but okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:07]** Because as you'll see, the incinerator is actually closer to where we're going down now.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:10]** So they take you down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:15]** Going down, down, baby, down to the incinerator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:18]** If you all will give me one second.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:23]** Like water through a drain, I'm spinning down, down, down.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:30]** So if you look closer to the bottom right of the map, you will see Keeve.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** Oh, there we go.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:40]** So the three of you, Keeve, Dr. OK, and Rick traverse down a set of ladders that go between decks.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** Keeve is leading.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:47]** You land in a vestibule where ahead of you there is one door and to your right there's another.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:49]** Keeve takes the right door.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** You follow.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:57]** You walk in to what is a rather small room.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** It seems like

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:03]** Kind of a control room for the ship.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:08]** Seems like there are three or four terminals that you can sit at.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** They seem to control various systems.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:14]** It seems like there might be some servers here.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** What's this door?

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:17]** You're talking about the door in the southwest corner.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:23]** And Keeve says, that's actually going right into a pretty sensitive part.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** It's a little loud in there.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:31]** I'm a little concerned about it, but that might be closer to the...

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:54]** to the drift engine so i i want to keep that safe area i don't don't want my passengers to get hurt i like engines they walk over to the southern wall it kind of pulls down this metal handle and when you look in you can see that this is the incinerator you can't you wouldn't want to get in there you could if you needed to but

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** You don't want to clamber in there.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:58]** That's where you... Because you'll get incinerated.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:02]** Because you will get literally incinerated and burned up.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:06]** So you chuck the bodies in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:10]** Seems like I made pretty fast work of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** Thank you.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:13]** I've got to go help out with...

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:18]** Cleaning up and then... We'll see ourselves out.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** Oh, sure, sure, sure.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** Here, it might be faster.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** I don't know where your rooms are.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:27]** It might be faster to go out this way, but... Which way?

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** They point to a door on the east wall.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:33]** If you want to go out this way, it might be a little faster.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:38]** If you want to get back to the galley, but you could do either, or you could just go up to here.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:44]** Now I'm going to check on a few things in the engine area first, and then I really need to take care of the galley.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:48]** I guess I'll be seeing you up there soon.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:48]** Thank you again.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:50]** I really appreciate it.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** And they leave out the eastern door.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** You're quite welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:56]** Rick turns to Dr.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:01]** O.K., kind of confused, and says, You know the way out of here?

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:04]** I will follow you then.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:04]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:09]** I don't know the way out, but I could go out this way, you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:15]** I mean, you sound like you know where you're going, so do you want to roll a bluff on me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:19]** You could tell that... Here, I'll say this.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:24]** In terms of logistics, the door that you came in, you could go back up.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:27]** Keeve is just trying to like, Keeve is an engineer.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:29]** He's just trying to think of all the possible things.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:29]** You can go out that door.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** You can go out this door.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:34]** You, uh, in case you want to like see more of the engine room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** Uh, Rick is also an Android.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:44]** So he has a flat affect, which is a, uh, plus two D of DCs.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** Okay.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:47]** Since motive checks, um,

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:50]** Yeah, like androids just don't, they don't comprehend.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** They don't pick up on those cues.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** Emotions and cues.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:53]** Okay.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:56]** So when you said like, oh, I could just go this way.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** He just, he looked at you and goes like, oh, you know the way around the ship.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:00]** I guess I'll follow you.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** Like that's the way Rick is thinking about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:10]** Can I learn anything about these computers before... Doctor, okay, you can tell if you wanted to make an engineering check to see exactly what they're doing, you could.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:15]** But just from the outset, it looks like they're just control systems for the ship.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** For the ship, for the engines and such.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** And just all the systems.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** Why don't we go this way?

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:29]** So as you exit the eastern door, you see that you're actually in a central corridor where to the south are a set of closed double doors.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:36]** Through the panes beyond, you can see the drift engine components and some more of the sensitive components.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:44]** Areas that Keeve was referring to, to your north, are a set of open double doors that intersect with a hallway.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:52]** Across that hallway, it opens into a low ceiling, larger area full of computer banks that are pretty important, it seems.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** One end of that...

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:57]** The intersecting hallway likely goes back to the ladders you came down.

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:00]** The other end presumably goes to another way up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:03]** Rick is kind of aimlessly following you because he doesn't know where to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:07]** Rick, do you care to go back to the quarters or to have a look around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:12]** I thought you were returning to the quarters area.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** What is your intentions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:21]** I'm always curious as to, you know, as a scientist and a scholar, what kind of vessel we are on.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:23]** Would you care to assist me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:31]** I am willing to follow you and explore, but I don't want to violate any rules or regulations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:38]** I feel as though Keeve was pretty upfront about us being able to explore.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** That was my impression.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** Let's proceed then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** Okay.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:45]** So where do you go?

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:47]** Go up through the corridor to the computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:52]** What's below me, by the way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:58]** Below you, you can see through the panel that looks like it's another long corridor.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:03]** You can see some sort of big power core off to the right.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:09]** So you're guessing this is probably where there's a lot of the real mechanics.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:18]** And then when you look through this door here, you can see another set of computer banks as well as another large, some sort of apparatus that's moving down here.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:22]** Probably, again, part of the power core, part of the engine.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:24]** Some pretty heavy-duty stuff going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** Let's go up here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:35]** So... As you walk up, you start walking north in the corridor.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** And...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:42]** What you see... My heart is racing right now.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:46]** It's sketchy and scary, I'll be honest.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** Oh, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** It's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** Is this going to get really bad really quick?

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:55]** We're just going to open the door on a monster or ghost or something.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:57]** What kind of ship is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:01]** So, to your right, you see...

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:15]** a similar door and we split the party just to note so you see a similar door to your right you're at a tea like a tea hallway you see a similar door to your right and Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:29]** you think that door is probably where Keeve was talking about like that's similar to the steps that we came down there's just two of them for ease of access yes of course makes sense

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:42]** You can see that this area in front of you, it are all these like bracket L kind of shaped walls that seem to indicate different terminals, probably some servers.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:44]** There are probably some things back there.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:47]** It's just another little like lower area.

**[00:31:48 - 00:32:14]** indented low and wide alcove on the wall right you can tell that the uh here i'll reveal it a bit you can see that each of these is like a little corridor that goes back like server stack rows yeah yeah yeah i can't there there are some like cable runs and and raceways and stuff at the top it's it's definitely not meant for passengers to be here

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:26]** And at this point, I'm actually going to ask Kelly and Nick to just take off your headphones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** Because you're not here.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:31]** I don't like this going at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** Take a break, guys.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** Just take a break for a quick second.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** Nick's like, all right, I'm just going to hop on my phone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** Then he's going to kill us both.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** Because he's the imposter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:42]** Nick is the imposter and he can't hear us.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:42]** Perfect.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:46]** They're going to see probably on roll 20.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** It's okay.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** If not, it's fine.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:52]** For everyone listening, I've revealed a little bit ahead of this server room, a little bit to the right.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:58]** To the left, you see almost a carbon copy.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** of what is on the right.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:09]** You see the door that's at the end of the hallway is the same door that was straight ahead of you when you first landed on this deck.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:26]** But weirdly enough, as you started walking forward, you thought for a split second, maybe you heard... And... Just like mumbling or voices?

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** Just voices.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:36]** And as you did, you turn a corner in the server room of engineering.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:59]** You kind of almost stumble upon what appears to be the security chief, Algiada, standing in the shadows kind of to one side of this corridor, talking to the Vesk, who you saw when you were first boarding.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:06]** And right as you step in, you kind of look to your right, look to your left and see them.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:11]** They're both just seemingly having maybe an argument.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:35]** just too risky we should we should stick to the plan if we follow the plan it'll go wrong and we'll get nothing she kind of retorts and they seem like they're about to continue and then it's at that moment that the vest turns sees you and touches algiata algiata turns takes a step out

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** I'm sorry, what are you doing here?

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:39]** This is not a section in which you belong.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** Is there something that I can help you with?

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** Are you lost?

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:46]** She's talking to Rick and Dr. Oak.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** We were helping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:51]** We were trying to find our way back to the galley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:53]** Dispose of some bodies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:58]** I think, you know, I did hear about something.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** I did get a call about something going on in the galley.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** Is everything all right?

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:03]** Is there an issue?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** Maybe we've handled it?

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:08]** There were some asteroid lice that were released.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:11]** We were able to dispatch them fairly quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Is everything okay down here?

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:15]** Absolutely, everything is okay.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:21]** We're just having a conversation, and the Vesk turns and walks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:25]** Sense motive with my negative one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:27]** Sense motive.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** So the Vesk starts to walk away.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:33]** They open the door, and the door closes, and they leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Yeah, I'm an android.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:38]** I rolled a nine.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** I got an eight for sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:41]** Eight?

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:41]** Ooh.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** I got a 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** Oh!

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** Nice.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:47]** Okay.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:50]** That is awesome.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:55]** So, with your sense motive, Rick, you can't quite tell.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** You don't really know.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:05]** But with your sense motive, Dr. Okay, it seems... How do I say this?

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:12]** You recall that Algiata...

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:17]** ...said... ...we... ...during the exchange.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:24]** Maybe... ...she just is... ...a little bit annoyed... ...that you're there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** That's what Rick sees, you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:29]** Or that's what... That's what Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:29]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:30]** sees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:38]** I think... ...maybe it's best that I... ...that I walk you back... ...to the galley?

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Come.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:39]** Come.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:45]** She starts to walk towards the door that the vest left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:49]** Can I roll a perception check on this area where they were standing?

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Absolutely.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:57]** 15 plus, what is my perception?

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** Found it.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** Plus four.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** I got a 19 on that perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** 19.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** Area seems normal.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:04]** Seems fine.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:06]** In fact, I will reveal it for you.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:14]** Seems like another little cubby where there's another passage on the right above that leads further into the server room.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** Seems like just two chairs.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** Computer.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** Come on.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** She starts to walk through the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** I suppose I should follow.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Can I see down this?

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:31]** Like, is there anything... There's nothing on, like, the computers that would indicate, like, what they were doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:34]** No, and it didn't seem like they were on the computer.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** It just seemed like they were talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:37]** They were just talking amongst themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** So she leads you up.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:42]** If you come up, she leads you out over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:43]** All right.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** How do you want to inform the others that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** Nick!

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Kelly!

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:50]** Have a good night.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:52]** Thank you.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:53]** All right.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:53]** Goodbye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:54]** Excuse me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:55]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** Who are you again?

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** I am Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:04]** Hello, Rick19.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** My name is Al Giada.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:09]** I'm the chief security officer here.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:11]** It's good that I ran into you.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:16]** I'm glad that I was able to clear up, make sure that everything was okay.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:22]** Thank you for being more than just a passenger, for being someone who helps steward the safety of the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:28]** Can I ask you about your concerns that you had earlier that we overheard?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:28]** Oh, absolutely.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:32]** I guess maybe you haven't had a chance to meet him yet.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:36]** That is Trostenec.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:38]** He is a fellow passenger.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** I don't often get to see him.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:44]** We've done some security work in the past.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:52]** I was trying to convince him to upgrade this rickety robot that he's got stored in cargo there.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Sense motive.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:59]** I'll say that you already did a good sense mode before, but I'll give you one more.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:09]** He wanted to kind of land some better jobs, so I'm just giving him some friendly advice between professionals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** Some jobs, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** Yes, he's a bounty hunter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** I am a bounty hunter as well.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** Then maybe you would know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:21]** Can I detect deception as my sense motive check?

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** Is that one of the things in the core rule book?

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** I believe so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:24]** Sorry, what did you ask?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:29]** You can use sense motive to determine whether something just said to you was a deception or a lie.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:32]** Yeah, I mean, I think that's part of the normal sense motive.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:34]** What did you roll on your sense motive?

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:34]** Eighteen.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:35]** Eighteen.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** What did you roll, Rick?

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Four.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:37]** Four.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:38]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:39 - 00:40:05]** yeah he believes everything you're saying right now what do you say i'm gonna ask that i have to say something no but like are you just trying to yeah i'm like but like you already did a sense motive earlier okay so i could say something like oh what kind of work is he looking for like perhaps help but wouldn't that endeavor he just is i think heading to absalom for some new i go ahead we'll


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:10]** Well, I just wanted to know if she genuinely was talking about what work.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:19]** So I would pry into that in an attempt to see if she was flustered at all by that question.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** About the work?

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:22]** No.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:31]** Well, yeah, because, I mean, she's acting annoyed that we were there and that, like, she's trying to get this trustnic, right?

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:32]** Trustnic.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** Trustnic to convince him to take a job?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** Like, what kind of job?

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:45]** No, she's trying to convince him that he needs to upgrade his robot if he wants to get better jobs.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** Gotcha.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:51]** But what we heard them say was, stick to the plan.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** If we follow the plan, we will get nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** Do you say that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:56]** Do you ask her?

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:00]** No, that's me as a player thinking out loud.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:04]** Rick has no idea what's going on, but Kevin is thinking hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:07]** Is there anything else that I can do for you?

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:10]** I would like to go back to my room.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** Is there anything else?

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** Again, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:15]** All right.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** No, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:18]** If there's nothing, take care.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:23]** She walks away.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:26]** Rick is going to go back into the mess hall.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:28]** Yeah, so you're back now in the mess hall.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** As if nothing was wrong.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:32]** He just wanders back in, sits back down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:37]** So you're back in the mess hall, and here's Iniko.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:38]** You guys back?

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** You got your cans on?

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:41]** Yep.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:44]** Thank you for being patient while I asked you to take them off.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** We've been drinking up here.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** Yeah, so lots of drinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:50]** So you're drinking.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** You're hanging out.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** Yeah.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Rick and Dr. OK come back in.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:58]** Song had kind of pointed out where the nice whiskey was.

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** What's going on?

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:01]** What's going on as we come in?

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:03]** What have you two been up to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:11]** So as they went out and kind of helped them clean up, Nico kind of walks, sits down and grabs his whiskey.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:15]** And he's just like, that reminds me of the last time I was smuggling guns.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Your stories are great.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** Hey, guys.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:21]** Hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** Guys.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:25]** What's up?

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Hey, Rick.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:30]** Why don't you come over here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** Okay.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** I will join you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:39]** I'm on the ship to clear my name.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:43]** I'm flying far from home.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:53]** Before I left, I asked if they knew if I would ever come home.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:59]** They said, well, take it or leave it.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:01]** Take it or leave it.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:05]** Something you never know.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:09]** Take it or leave it.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:11]** Take it or leave it.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:17]** It's time for us to go.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:25]** Cheers!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:25]** Cheers!

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:27]** This is baffling to me.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** I didn't know you would know that one.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:31]** Can I roll a culture check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:32]** I didn't even know that song.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** The real question is how do you...

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:38]** I got 13 on culture check.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** Yeah, you saw it to me at some point.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** I can't remember.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** We'll talk about it later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:45]** So, Will, you're going to roll a culture check?

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:47]** Yeah, I have no idea what that was.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:49]** Okay, give me a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** 13.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:52]** Yeah, you don't really know it.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:56]** It just seems like a song, like kind of a shanty thing.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:57]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:04]** There seems to be perhaps something afoot on this ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** I would have to agree.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:09]** That conversation did seem quite suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:13]** Suspicious?

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** What are you talking about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Come over here.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** Come grab a drink.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** Come on, you big old bucket of bolts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:36]** They might have had a few too many drinks, Rick, but what Rick means to say is we encountered some people on the ship that seem to have a plan in the midst in which perhaps they plan to...

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:47]** rip off someone or something and uh perhaps the professor is involved so i wonder perhaps he was supposed to die just now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Really?

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:50]** You think this was a targeted attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:54]** Look, I can't stand up or pay attention or turn my head at you.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** Can you just sit down?

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** I'm really wasted.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** So I can actually look at you.

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:00]** You guys got wasted in like five minutes.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:00]** Yeah, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:07]** Rick will be a little confused by that statement and will just like awkwardly sit down like, uh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** Make it easy there, Rick.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:10]** Come on.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** We're just a little junkie nobody, sir.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Come on.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:17]** Now, you guys have mentioned something about conspiracies.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:22]** That's not a word I bandy about life, so you're going to have to take it from the top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** I would ask you to lower your voice, Nico.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:31]** It's just that maybe we should be discussing this since we all came on together.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:41]** Really, I mean, I don't know you from, you know, say, some other slug, but, you know,

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:49]** I don't quite know how to put it, but there's some things afoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:53]** You're going to have to go ahead and explain that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** All right.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:55]** Go on.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** Back to the southern accent.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** Is that your permanent accent for Nico now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:04]** It's like a little bit of Lando Calrissian, a little bit of Han Solo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:09]** Listen, I've learned he's a man of the world, all right?

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** Sometimes he's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:32]** Rick is going to ignore the ridiculousness going on and turn and look at Dr. Okay and say, do you believe that those lice were targeted attacks on that professor?


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:32]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:46]** It's a very strange occurrence to just have, uh, lice appear and, well, we don't know their nature or their origin, and with the people below, uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:51]** I'm sorry, but I don't know if I see a connection currently.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:56]** The professor brought the lice himself in that container.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:56]** Did he know he had them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:59]** Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:03]** You guys are talking about connections, conspiracies, targeted lice attacks.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:09]** I thought that was... I thought you guys were just pulling one on me for a second, but if you guys want to go ahead and explain it, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** Oh, no, no.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** We are quite serious.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** We overheard a conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:18]** Song walks out holding some food.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:20]** They put down some food.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:20]** Well, hey, you're back.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** Yeah, I'm starting to put out the food.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:26]** Give me just maybe 10, 15 more minutes here.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:28]** Dinner should be served pretty soon.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** Let me know if you need anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:34]** Do you know where they brought the professor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** Sorry, sorry, sorry.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** I'm getting a lot of things at once.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** I'm pretty busy here.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:40]** I can answer one question.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** Which question do you want?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** Well, go ahead after this.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:46]** It's just a real quick order here for you, Mr. Salk.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:49]** I think Hughes and I would like another bottle of whiskey when you get a moment.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** That's fine.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:53]** If you go back to my compatriot Slug here, I think he might have a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:56]** They just point to the bottle that's on the table.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:57]** Dr.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** O.K., you had a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:02]** Do you know where they brought the Professor Benjamin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:04]** I believe the Professor just went to his room.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** He seemed to be able to walk.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:08]** It wasn't too bad, but I did ask.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:11]** I think Lozu should be checking.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** On the professor.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** Thank you.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:17]** Jeez, who else thinks song is a bit of a hard ass?

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:24]** I like you, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:34]** So Rick's going to turn back to Dr. OK and say, like, I agree that there is something suspicious going on, but I'm not sure if they are connected.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:38]** Yeah, I'm not either, but something doesn't seem right.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** Laces just don't appear out of nowhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:45]** Would you like to investigate it further?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:51]** I think it would definitely improve our station, so to speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:54 - 00:49:00]** So the door opens, and who walks in but the Yosuke, Dr.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** O.K., that you had seen before.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** This Yosuke... Where did you see this Yosuke at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** In the gym, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:07]** Dr.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:10]** O.K., yeah, you saw this Yosuke in the gym.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:14]** This Yosuke short...

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:18]** russet fur, tan tail, gold eyes.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:25]** One of the ears is pierced with a small silver hoop.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:28]** There's like a stained flight suit.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:36]** While you can tell from the flight suit that maybe this individual doesn't quite care about their appearance all the time.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:43]** For this moment, it looks like they showered up a little bit after being in the gym.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:57]** And they walk in and they look over before you and nod, hold up a hand and wave and kind of a half-hearted smile and sit down at the table.

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:01]** And then look over, see some of the food that's up on the table.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:05]** They start to walk over and prepare a plate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:10]** I'm going to walk over and try to engage in some small talk.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:10]** Okay.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** I think that's a good idea.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:16]** Do you believe he is also involved in this conspiracy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:26]** That's why I'm going over there to the food table to see what... Hey, uh... Oh, sorry to interrupt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** What can I do?

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:32]** I don't know what's happening, but if he needs me to smash someone, just let me know.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** How can I help?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:35]** So you are good in combat.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:37]** That sounds like something I should remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** Yes, you should.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** What do you think they're going on about?

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** They're acting mighty funny.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:50]** Some conspiracy, some, I don't know, thing with the professor and the rat guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:52]** Yeah, so Rick's going to just look you in the eye.

**[00:50:52 - 00:51:05]** He's very serious about this right now, and he's going to be like, when we went down there to get rid of those bodies, we walked back up and overheard a Vesk talking to Chief Security Officer Al-Jadda.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:05]** Yeah.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:14]** They were having a rather suspicious conversation, talking about a plan and whether or not they should stick to it.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:17]** I mean... There seems to be something amiss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:22]** The door to your left, the one that Dr. O.K.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:27]** and Rick, you came through, Keeve, walks in.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Waves over.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:33]** They rub their stomach, excited for dinner.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:37]** And they walk over to the table to start to kind of make a plate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:48]** Rick is going to take his leave from your guys' table, and he's going to walk over directly to the food table, but towards Keef.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:52]** The food on the table is what he's looking for, but it's near Keef.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** That's kind of what Dr. O'Keefe was doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:54]** Okay.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:57]** So let's go around the horn here.

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:00]** Nico and Hears, what are you all doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:06]** We're just... At least I'm sitting at the table just trying to...

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:10]** trying to digest what Rick has just told Nico.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:22]** Nico's still kind of drunk and kind of caught up in the revelry of the moment and just doesn't quite believe everything he's heard.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** It's just kind of bizarre.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** Here's...

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:44]** uh here's is kind of similar i mean he is very drunk and i think the last explanation helped him understand what's going on but he doesn't know how to contribute or what to do okay so he's gonna drink with nico i think uh so rick you walk over towards here's or towards keith


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:47]** And Keeve is loading up their plate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** Yeah, Rick will also load up his plate.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** Okay.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:57]** And he's going to look at Keeve and say, like, your name is Keeve, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:58]** Yes.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** Yes.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** Keeve, you're...

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** Rick, Rick19.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** Yes, yes.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** Thank you again for helping.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** That was most generous of you.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:12]** I can't thank you enough.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:17]** I hope maybe you saw a little bit of the workings of what I do here.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:20]** I don't know if you could pick it up, but I'm the engineer here.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:24]** That is an impressive position to have.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Thank you.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:26]** Thank you.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** They seem very appreciative.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** Like, that is just not something that comes from passengers.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** Thank you.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** I really appreciate that.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:35]** And then they start putting some things.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:40]** And you can tell the ambiance has changed, not just from the fact that I changed the Syrinscape music.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** Thank you, Syrinscape.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:48]** But the fact that it seems like Song has brought out some more food by this point.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:52]** And we'll get to Dr. OK in just a minute.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** Rick, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:59]** He's going to look at Keeve and he's going to... He's trying to probe just a little bit, even though he's terrible at this.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:04]** But he's going to ask Keeve, like, have you been on this ship very long?

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:07]** Do you know the other crew members very well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:10]** Do I know the other crew members very well?

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** Yeah, yeah, I do.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:19]** This is actually my first job out of Marata, but I've always wanted to be an engineer.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:24]** So yeah, I've been here now for maybe a year, a year or two.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** I know them pretty well, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:29]** You happen to know who the large Vesk is.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:32]** I believe his name is Trostnik?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** Um, Trostnik...

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:38]** No, I don't know who that is, no.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:44]** I don't know why I have a British accent suddenly, but I don't know who that is.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:47]** Are they a passenger?

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** They're not a crew, if that's what you're asking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:57]** Okay, do you possibly know the chief security officer, Al Giada?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** Algeata.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Yeah.

**[00:54:59 - 00:54:59]** Yeah.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:00]** I do.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:06]** Then possibly this trust neck is a friend of Algeata.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:06]** Sure.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:08]** Or some kind of relation.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:08]** Sure.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:09]** Yeah.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** That's all I, I don't know.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** All right.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:15]** Well, Dr. Okay.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** Unless there's something else.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:17]** Yeah.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:19]** He's just like awkwardly cuts that off.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** Okay.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** It makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:26]** Piece of Rick is a little ham handed with this social interaction stuff.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Right.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** You know, Dr. Okay.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:32]** You walk over, uh, this short Yusuke is next to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:40]** I'm picking through the items with the tongs to examine whether or not they have salt.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:44]** I'm very disappointed in song at the moment.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:48]** Oh, gosh, there's nothing to eat here.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:50]** Oh, I'm sorry.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** What is your name?

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:53]** I don't mean to be in your way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:56]** Hey, yeah, that's fine.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** Graph.

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:12]** At that moment, there is the door in the center here that leads right to the quarters, opens, and in walks the hobgoblin passenger from before.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:24]** The hobgoblin starts to walk over past Nico and hears, and very loudly, the four goblins walk in, and they are...

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:29]** And just like pushing each other and loud.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:32]** And it is suddenly just, this is now a scene, right?

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:35]** Like it's like, this is the dinner time.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** There seems to be a lot of different people here going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:40]** John, can I roll a culture check with a minus because I'm drunk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:41]** Yes.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:43]** Give me one sec though with Dr. Okay.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:46]** So Dr. Okay, as soon as you say, what is your name?

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:50]** And the Yusuke looks...

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:50]** All right.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** Grath.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** Grath Medic.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Hey, pleasure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:54]** What's your name?

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:58]** Your name is Grath Medic?

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:58]** Yep.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** I'm the pilot.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** Oh, you're a pilot.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:02]** I thought you were a medic for a moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:03]** No.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** Medic.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** With a T, not a D. My mistake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:13]** I do not enunciate well because, as you can tell, I'm a shy roon.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:37]** sure yeah uh yeah we don't know dr contu okadas but you may call me dr okay pleasure to meet you that's okay yes and he just reaches over starts to put some more things on a plate starts to turn and starts to kind of walk away nice to meet you do you work on this ship


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** Uh, yeah.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:40]** Oh, yes.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** Sorry, you're the pilot.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** Yeah, I'm the pilot.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:47]** How long have you been the pilot of the Chimera?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:52]** I've been a pilot here for probably the past couple of years.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:55]** It's not my first gig, but, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:58]** Do you know the rest of the... If he's a pilot, who's flying the ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:59 - 00:57:59]** It's an autopilot.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:02]** You realize that there's an autopilot for the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:02]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** I heard you talking across the room.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** That's why I answered your question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:07]** Yes.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Fascinating.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:15]** Are you familiar with the whole crew, or do you mostly keep to yourself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:19]** I'm familiar, actually, yeah, with the whole crew.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** They're not always fun, let's say.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:24]** Maybe they'd be a little more fun if they lightened up.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:30]** and he points over to the drinks that are on the table, and actually he's like, actually, I'm going to lighten up a little bit.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** Walks over, grabs one of the drinks.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:33]** You want some?

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:37]** Yes, I'll join you for a drink if you don't mind.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** Well, this is good.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** This is great.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:45]** Seems like your friends over there are definitely enjoying some of that too.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:46]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:51]** Nico's just going to raise his glass over in their general direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:57]** I don't know the songs they sing, though, so I can't really drink with them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:01]** Well, you can drink with anybody.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** I don't know why you're turning down drinking friends.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:06]** Drinking friends are the only friends that you really need, right?

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** I suppose you're right.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** He kind of starts to walk over.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:10]** Come over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:13]** Sit down and drink with us.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:14]** Come on.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Hey, come on over here.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** Come on.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** Let's go.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** We're telling stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:22]** Grath turns to Dr. O'Kane and says, do you know that Sheeran?

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:23]** Yes.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** He helped me.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:28]** All right, well, tell him not to call me Rat Guy.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** Oh, hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** And I'll drink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:33]** Rat Guy!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:37]** You know, some people are kind of sensitive to the whole rat raccoon thing.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:39]** You know, might be.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:40]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:43]** I can't hear you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:44]** Our friend here.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:44]** Hi.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** Sorry.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:50]** I can't remember his name.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** I remember his last name.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** Medic.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:52]** Graph.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** Graph.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:54]** Medic.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:56]** He's a Yusuke.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** What's his deal exactly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** What is he?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** I'm right here.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** You don't need to talk.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** Yeah, what's your deal?

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** I'm in third person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** All right, hold on, hold on.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** I'm the pilot here.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:09]** Let me take it from here, fella.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:19]** And at that point, there's like, it sounds like for a second there's some clamor and you look over and the goblins have just taken food and they just dropped it on the ground.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:21]** And then they're going to get more food.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** They're like, not...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:49]** eating and the hobgoblin is just standing there looking over them almost apathetically not caring what they're doing so uh first nico's gonna do a couple things here first nico wants to roll a kind of a culture check with the minus because he's drunk he's not gonna be at 100 full faculty so he wants to know this is he wants to remember whether or not this is normal behavior for the hobgoblins he may or may not have come across okay go ahead yeah that's fine

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:51]** Natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:52]** Natural one.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** They just seem loud.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:57]** They seem like fairies.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** Yeah, they seem great.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:00]** They seem real happy.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:02]** Yep.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:12]** And then the second thing he's going to do, he's going to say... He's going to turn to here and say, I think what my friend's trying to say here, my Yosuke friend, is...

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:15]** We're just all trading war stories over here.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:18]** I've smuggled guns for a long time in my life.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:21]** I used to own my own weapons manufacturing company.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:27]** And we're just over here trading stories, and we're a little bit drunk, so please excuse my friend.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:37]** And at that, he's going to roll a diplomacy check to kind of, one, ease his mind, and two, just kind of acquaint him to kind of like the rougher mentality of both himself and hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:38]** Okay, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:43]** So that's going to be a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:45]** Okay.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:48]** Hey, when we're drinking, things happen.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:49]** It's all good.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** I'm Grath.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:51]** Good to meet you.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** What's your name?

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:54]** Okay, Nico.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** Nice to meet you, Grath.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:57]** Grath turns over to Hears.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** I'm Grath.

**[01:01:59 - 01:01:59]** Didn't I get your name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:02]** Yeah, name's Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:03]** Hears.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:03]** Come here, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:04]** All right.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:06]** You know, can I just share something with you all?

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:09]** You all are really probably...

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:11]** The funnest passengers.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:17]** I mean, those goblins are... Song is going to go ape shit about what those goblins are doing.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:23]** But you all, so far... Just sitting here with you, you all are the funnest passengers.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:24]** Hands down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:25]** Hands down.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:27]** I appreciate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** Cheers to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:33]** That tickles my phalanges a bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:35]** Rick...

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:38]** Uh, you're still not at the table with grass.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** Here's Nico.

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]** Not that you need to be.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:42]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:44]** Uh, Rick is sitting off by himself.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:48]** Um, he's like, I mean, he's, he can hear what's going on over there, right?

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** It's not that far away.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:50]** Yeah.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:56]** Um, but he sat by himself at an empty table and is just kind of observing everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:57]** All right.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:59]** Actually, yeah.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:00]** I approve.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:02]** He's going to actually sit on this side of the table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** Very androidish.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** Very androidish.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:04]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:11]** Yeah, Keeve goes to sit down, sit at a table, pull out their pad.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:14]** The goblins are still pretty cantankerous.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:16]** Some time passes.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** You guys are hanging out with Grath.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:26]** Unless there's something that you want to talk to Grath about, he seems just kind of pretty happy just to talk and swap stories, hang out.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:28]** Dinner kind of goes, moves on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:34]** I'd like to bring up El Giada Yom at some point.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:56]** in the conversation naturally like the rest of the crew all right so you bring up algae yeah okay yeah yeah uh so you bring up algae yeah yeah what is it that you want to know about her what's what's going on how long has she you know been here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:57 - 01:04:00]** She's been here for as long as I've been here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:03]** You guys came up at the same time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:05]** I wouldn't say came up at the same time.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:07]** She's not really a person to come up with.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** But she's been around.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** We don't interact that often.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:12]** I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:19]** Nico's going to kind of ask... Nico's going to follow up with Grath.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:25]** He's going to follow up with Grath like, what do you mean by not someone you come up with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:27]** She's just...

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:27]** I don't know.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:30]** She's just a little rude.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:31]** She's always been a little rude to people.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:37]** She's nice to the passengers sometimes, but she's a little rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:38]** Tell me a little bit more about her.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:43]** He's going to try to be a little disarming just by drinking a little bit more.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:46]** He's going to add a diplomacy check to that, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:49]** Give me your diplomacy check.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:50]** I can aid, right?

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:52]** You can aid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:54]** You got to get a DC 10.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:55]** So that's going to be a 21.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:56]** 21.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** That's a 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:58]** Yeah.

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:59]** I do not aid.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:00]** I rolled a four.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** You rolled a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:03]** Okay.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:09]** Look, I don't want to get you too involved in crew politics.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** It's not a big deal.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:10]** I lost something.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:12]** I was a little concerned.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:13]** Maybe she took it.

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:15]** We don't need to go into it.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:16]** It's fine.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:23]** She's just not my favorite crew member, not the person that I really want to go hang out with after I end my shift.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:25]** You know what I'm saying?

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:25]** That's it.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:26]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:26]** Thank you, Chip.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:28]** Just offhand, what did you lose?

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:35]** I mean, it seems like it's just a strange harbor, and I just like knowing who I'm flying with, and I'm sure you feel the same way.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:35]** Sure, sure.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:37]** I'm sure you inspect your ship before you take off every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:40]** She lost something that was important to me.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:41]** That's it.

**[01:05:41 - 01:05:44]** It was just a little family heirloom that I had.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:47]** And it's not my favorite.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:50]** What was it?

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:51]** It's a family heirloom.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:52]** Yeah, but I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:52]** It's a ring.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:53]** Is it a necklace?

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:54]** Oh, a ring.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:55]** Yeah, it's a ring.

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:56]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:57]** Yeah.

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:01]** So anyway, I don't want to talk about it.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:01]** Who wants another drink?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:03]** It just starts to go.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:04]** You don't have to ask me.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:05]** It's more drinks.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:08]** Can I do a sense motive on that?

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:09]** He doesn't want to talk about it.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:11]** Yeah, sure.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:14]** 14 on the die.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:15]** I'll aid, by the way, on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:16]** Plus 3.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:16]** I'll aid.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]** 17.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:18]** Hold on, Nick.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:18]** 17.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:22]** Nick, did you get a... Yeah, roll for aid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:25]** Yeah, that's going to be success.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:28]** Can we explain how?

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:29]** It's like DC 10, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:33]** Yeah, so if you make that check and get a DC 10, the person can add a plus two to their roll.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:40]** Although for a sense motive, I'm going to say that since you all aren't like talking and being like, what did you think his motive was in that moment?

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:45]** Then it's more like, Nico, you might just pick up whatever Dr. OK picks up.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:46]** Does that make sense?

**[01:06:46 - 01:07:10]** yeah so dr okay you get the sense that it's just a sore subject he's not like he just met you your friends uh you're all a little drunk and hanging out he's not gonna like open up to you he already opened up by telling you that like he and algietta kind of aren't on the best of terms that was it you know it's like he's not gonna super go into it he just doesn't really want to talk about it anymore it's a bummer you say that you had a falling out

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:12]** I don't know if we got a falling out.

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:13]** We still work together.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:13]** We're professionals.

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:15]** Just, yeah.

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:16]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:17]** Sorry to hear that, friend.

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:19]** I appreciate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:19]** I appreciate it.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:20]** And he cheers as you.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:22]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:24]** Graft, it's a real pleasure drinking with you.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:26]** You can come and drink at my table anytime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:29]** Well, you all can come and drink in my room anytime.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:31]** I might have some spirits that maybe Song doesn't know about.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:32]** So, you know.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:33]** Not right now.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:35]** But we got a couple of days.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:37]** You're always welcome to come by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:38]** I have a weird question.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:40]** Give me that weird question.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:47]** So, um, are we, are we all like on the same page that alcohol is technically speaking a poison?

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:48]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:49]** Yes.

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:49]** Yeah.

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:50]** You roll a con check.

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:51]** If you were, you would.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:54]** You would probably roll the fortitude check.

**[01:07:55 - 01:08:20]** or fortitude yep well con talks about poisons that's fine but in terms of this i would probably go with fortitude because it's your ability to keep it but i think the fortitude is based on your con anyway so i have a poison rejection trait yeah so you're asking will you can i like not do you actually get drunk yeah that's something we'll have to look into okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:46]** i also have a resistance to poisons because you're an android okay we can look into that as graft goes to walk away to grab a drink nico wants to actually do a sense motive on the goblins uh over there once more just because they garnered his attention again and sure he just yeah i mean they've been loud and cantankerous uh this whole time 100 cantankerous and they're like pissed off


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:48]** That's a 16 plus 4.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:48]** That's 20.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:50]** No, like they're dancing around.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:52]** Maybe that wasn't the best term.

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:58]** Nick, let's do a perception check instead of a sense motive check.

**[01:08:58 - 01:08:59]** Because they're not saying anything.

**[01:08:59 - 01:09:00]** You're just doing perception.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:02]** So just add your perception bonus instead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:05]** Yeah, that's a plus zero, so that's just a flat 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:07]** 16, okay.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:12]** Yeah, I mean, they honestly just seem messy, gluttonous, and loud.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:14]** Maybe cantankerous wasn't the best word, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:18]** Cantankerous means bad-tempered, argumentative, and uncooperative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:24]** They are cantankerous in the sense that, like, if one of them steps on the other one's foot, they'll push him.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:28]** you know, and then get into like a little scuffle and then rowdy.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:28]** Yeah.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:29]** Rowdy.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:32]** And then the hobgoblin will kind of just break them up.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:33]** Having a row.

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:34]** Yeah.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:36]** Like having a row.

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:37]** That's where rowdy comes from.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:38]** Actually, I don't know.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:38]** So.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:40]** Dinner seems to go on.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:42]** Grats seem to get more drinks.

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:46]** Unless there's anything else you guys want to do, time passes.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:52]** That's pretty much everyone who goes in and everyone leaves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:58]** Nico's going to, throughout the course of the dinner and grabbing drinks, Nico's going to ask a little bit more about Dr. Okay.

**[01:09:59 - 01:10:02]** He wants to get to know a little bit more about Dr. Okay.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:06]** So he's going to say, Dr. Okay, tell me a little bit more about yourself here.

**[01:10:07 - 01:10:07]** Yeah.

**[01:10:07 - 01:10:14]** I've never seen someone, never encountered a slug before, and you seem to have a very unusual expertise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:19]** My race is Osharu.

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:22]** We are from the home world of Pabak.

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:27]** We do not share much with the common slug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:31]** Do you always, like, slime out all over the place like that?

**[01:10:32 - 01:10:33]** Is that a pretty common thing for you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:42]** When I feel threatened by a space louse, perhaps a little wit comes out.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:44]** A little piddle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:47 - 01:10:49]** You're a big man for admitting it.

**[01:10:49 - 01:10:49]** What can I say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:52]** Sometimes it works to my advantage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:55]** You're good as char, Dr. O'Kane.

**[01:10:55 - 01:10:56]** You're good with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:57 - 01:10:58]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:58 - 01:10:58]** Hey, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:00]** Hey, Rick.

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:00]** You still over there, buddy?

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:04]** At this point, they've all kind of left.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:07]** So it's pretty much just Rick and the three of you sitting at the table.

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:08]** Everybody cleared out?

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:08]** Yeah.

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:10]** Time has been going on.

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:11]** Time has been going on.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:13]** Unless you tell me that you wanted to talk to somebody.

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:16]** Did anyone want to talk to the Hobgoblins?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:19]** Nah, they're just being rowdy.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:20]** It's a rough crowd.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:21]** Nika dismisses it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:24]** The Hobgoblin was in charge of the rowdy.

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:26]** Yeah, he was the not rowdy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:29]** Yeah, but he didn't give a shit.

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:32]** It was just kind of more like people that he's either ashamed of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:38]** Can I roll a perception on the Hobgoblin to see if he had any kind of markers or anything on him?

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:39]** Sure.

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:41]** Yeah, I can do like a... I'm assuming it's a him.

**[01:11:41 - 01:11:43]** Sorry, that's bad on me.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:44]** It, her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:45]** That's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:46]** They.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:47]** Yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:50]** I rolled a 12 with a plus 5, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:52]** 12 with a plus 5, so that's a perception check.

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:54]** Perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:55]** Plus four.

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:56]** Why did my perception go down?

**[01:11:56 - 01:11:57]** Oh, no.

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:57]** Sorry.

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:58]** That was my acrobatics.

**[01:11:59 - 01:11:59]** Plus four.

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:01]** So, 16 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:02]** Yeah.

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:04]** I'll just tell you she, right?

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:06]** You can tell that it's a she.

**[01:12:07 - 01:12:09]** She's better dressed than the goblins.

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:39]** covered in tattoos wearing a similar armor in the sense that it's like a space suit it's ready for anything but you don't know i mean there's no tattoo necessarily that you might know but you could give me a culture check can i do a culture check culture check 20 20 what about you rick i don't i'm not even trained in culture you're not trained in culture then yeah then you can't do it dr okay you were also doing a perception check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:41]** Wait, is culture trained or untrained?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:42]** I think culture is trained.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:44]** I have a culture plus seven.

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:46]** He rolled a 13.

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:46]** Plus seven?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:47]** Okay.

**[01:12:47 - 01:13:00]** John, would it be dishonest to have... To dishonestly... Or not dishonest, to retroactively say that when Nico was observing over there, he was passively looking for anything that bothered him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:03]** If any...

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:14]** I don't know that it would be dishonest, but if you want, like, instead of saying that you're looking, then I'll say that now, if there's anything in particular, if you want to study them, you can do that now.

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:17]** But when you're over there, you weren't like actively doing it.

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:21]** You just need to tell me, oh yeah, now I'm going to check them out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:28]** Well, before the hop, before the hobgoblins walk out of the room, Nico's going to take one last look and both do a perception and culture.

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:29]** See if anything catches his eye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:30]** Are you trained in culture?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:35]** Yes, I had plus seven on my culture, so yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:37]** Okay, so Dr. Okay got a 20.

**[01:13:37 - 01:13:39]** Just give me a culture check, Nick.

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:40]** Just culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:44]** That's a plus seven on the culture with a 14 on the die.

**[01:13:44 - 01:13:45]** So 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:45]** Okay.

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:53]** So the four goblins, who are space goblins, just seem to be wearing all the same uniform.

**[01:13:53 - 01:14:05]** And from what you can tell from her tattoos and her uniform, it seems like she is some sort of a fighter for hire mercenary.

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:10]** And these seem to be people that she is responsible for as part of that group.

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:11]** She's a merc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:12]** All right.

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:19]** So Niko, when they all exit, Niko's just kind of look around in the rest of the room.

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:27]** He's just going to say, looks like this ship gets some pretty unseemly, unseemly company from what I've noticed.

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:31]** Not that I'm not used to rough crowds, but we have a little bit.

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:34]** We have a little troop of space goblins here.

**[01:14:36 - 01:14:38]** Space Goblin mercenaries walking about.

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:39]** Good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:41]** Yeah.

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:41]** Perhaps.

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:42]** Yeah, I don't think.

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:46]** The whole night has been ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:53]** John, were there any identifying marks for us to know what type of mercenary band they came from that would let us know anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:54]** No.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:54]** No.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:59]** Just, like, tattoos for general, like, Molon Lebe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:02]** Yeah.

**[01:15:02 - 01:15:03]** Or Insignia on the armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:04]** No.

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:11]** Before Keeve would have cut out, Rick probably would have asked, you know, is the professor doing okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:13]** Oh, I haven't checked in.

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:16]** I figured I'd give him some time to rest.

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:18]** I think Lauzu was going to go check.

**[01:15:20 - 01:15:22]** But I hope he's okay.

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:23]** He did walk out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:25]** Perhaps we should look ourselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:26 - 01:15:28]** Oh, Dr. Okay, I didn't see you walk up.

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:29]** Yes, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:30 - 01:15:32]** Can you tell us more about this professor?

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:34]** Where is he from?

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:35]** What does he study?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:15:35 - 01:15:36]** How do you know him?

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:42]** I don't... I just met him right before you came in with the... And the whole thing with the lice.

**[01:15:43 - 01:15:45]** I just met him.

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:48]** We kind of bumped into each other on the halls and just started talking for a little bit.

**[01:15:48 - 01:15:51]** Maybe five, ten minutes.

**[01:15:51 - 01:15:53]** He was very excited about that cube.

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:57]** I think he found out that I was an engineer and just wanted to show me something cool.

**[01:15:57 - 01:16:02]** He seems, when he likes something cool, he seems like he really likes something cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:05]** And you were the one to drop it, right?

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:06]** To drop it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:07]** No.

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:09]** I had it.

**[01:16:10 - 01:16:11]** He reached out for it.

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:13]** And when he reached out for it, it fell.

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:16]** I was not trying to drop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:16 - 01:16:19]** I'm not trying to... I didn't even think that those were real.

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:20]** I'm sorry.

**[01:16:20 - 01:16:23]** I was not intending to imply any kind of guilt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:25]** Is it his cube or Keeve's cube?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:25 - 01:16:26]** No, it was the professor's cube.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:26 - 01:16:28]** It was the professor's cube.

**[01:16:28 - 01:16:29]** But Keeve was holding it.

**[01:16:30 - 01:16:33]** Well, the professor reached out because I...

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:36]** I didn't think that it really was what it was, but it was.

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:39]** So he reached out.

**[01:16:39 - 01:16:40]** He seemed a little miffed.

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:43]** Can I roll a sense motive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:43 - 01:16:43]** Yeah, sure.

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:47]** Not that I have any chance of... Nope.

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:48]** No.

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:51]** Okay.

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:53]** I rolled a four with a minus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:16:53 - 01:17:00]** I'll tell you even with a four that they seem like they're being genuine, that they were happy to give it back and that dropping it was an accident.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:04]** Does it seem to be the same on a 15?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:11]** With a higher number, is it the same?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:11 - 01:17:11]** Yeah.

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:13]** All right.

**[01:17:13 - 01:17:19]** So as the night kind of dwindles down, if there wasn't anything else, then Rick will make his way out the room.

**[01:17:19 - 01:17:19]** Yeah.

**[01:17:19 - 01:17:25]** Oh, he will ask Keeve, do you know where the professor's quarters are located?

**[01:17:25 - 01:17:27]** I thought it was down here, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:30]** It would be near yours.

**[01:17:30 - 01:17:31]** I'm not sure where.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:32]** Okay.

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:33]** Thank you very much.

**[01:17:34 - 01:17:34]** Have a good evening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:35 - 01:17:35]** Sure.

**[01:17:36 - 01:17:37]** Here's is going to go to bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:38 - 01:17:39]** Yep.

**[01:17:39 - 01:17:40]** From battling.

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:41]** Okay.

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:42]** Here's goes to bed.

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:44]** So here's is here.

**[01:17:44 - 01:17:46]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:17:46 - 01:17:47]** Is here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:48 - 01:17:49]** Rick is here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:50]** Nico is here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:50]** Rick.

**[01:17:51 - 01:17:58]** Do you wish to join me in checking on the professor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:58 - 01:18:01]** Uh, Nico's going to bed as well.

**[01:18:01 - 01:18:09]** But before Nico goes to bed, he's, uh, before, yeah, before Nico goes to bed, though, he's going to check to see if his message pinged back anything.

**[01:18:09 - 01:18:10]** Okay.

**[01:18:10 - 01:18:13]** About whether or not he's going to be a fugitive in Absalom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:13 - 01:18:13]** Okay.

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:16]** So Nico checks his messages.

**[01:18:16 - 01:18:17]** Here's going to go to sleep.

**[01:18:18 - 01:18:18]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:18:18 - 01:18:21]** And Rick, you're going to go check on the professor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:22 - 01:18:22]** I did not.

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:23]** I said I was going.

**[01:18:24 - 01:18:27]** I asked Rick if he would care to join me.

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:30]** Checking on the professor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:33]** Rick is going to contemplate that.

**[01:18:34 - 01:18:41]** And then he's going to... He will turn to you and honestly say, yes, I am concerned for him.

**[01:18:42 - 01:18:44]** I would like to ask him how he is doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:44 - 01:18:45]** Splendid.

**[01:18:46 - 01:18:49]** So you all go to... So here's you walk in.

**[01:18:50 - 01:18:50]** Nico...

**[01:18:52 - 01:18:54]** You go over to the computer terminal.

**[01:18:54 - 01:18:55]** And Rick and Dr.

**[01:18:55 - 01:19:00]** O.K., you go over to the professor's room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:00 - 01:19:01]** Yes?

**[01:19:01 - 01:19:04]** Can I do an investigation to learn?

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:31]** kev did you kev did you write that on your thing on roll 20 stay out yeah stay out yeah for everyone watching rick wrote rick's stay out on his room it's great uh can i roll an investigation to see if either door has any kind of sign or anything to our perception to see if we know which room is the professor's we said it's one of these two correct


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:19:32 - 01:19:39]** Yeah, I mean, you could tell fromâso there are four rooms on each side, eight total.

**[01:19:39 - 01:19:41]** You all have the middle four rooms.

**[01:19:42 - 01:19:45]** The top four rooms, as you walked by, you could kind of hear.

**[01:19:46 - 01:19:51]** You're like, oh, I think this is the Hobgoblin and the Space Goblins up there, closer to the mess hall.

**[01:19:51 - 01:19:52]** Yeah, closer to the mess hall.

**[01:19:52 - 01:19:55]** You're like, I think those are the rooms.

**[01:19:55 - 01:19:55]** Okay.

**[01:19:55 - 01:19:56]** Dr. O.K.

**[01:19:57 - 01:20:01]** and Rick, when you walk to the south, you notice a couple things.

**[01:20:01 - 01:20:02]** Do I just roll for this?

**[01:20:03 - 01:20:09]** You see a set of the same stairs that are near the galley right in front of you in the south.

**[01:20:09 - 01:20:13]** Those probably go down and up again to the different levels of the ship.

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:18]** You see a sign to the south that points around the corner.

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:23]** You see that that's where the escape pods are.

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:27]** So this corridor that's right beneath you, presumably there are some escape pods there.

**[01:20:27 - 01:20:43]** And the two rooms right on either side of you, you look and from what you can tell, one of the rooms is Trostenex on the right and the one on the left is Professor Vendress.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:44]** How can we tell that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:20:44 - 01:20:48]** You can just tell because there's like a little sign on the side of the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:48 - 01:20:54]** I didn't know if there were like giant claw marks where the door opens because he's a bastard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:54 - 01:20:55]** Because he can't open it.

**[01:20:56 - 01:21:04]** I'm kind of more envisioning kind of like something like you see on the trains a little bit where how the conductors know when you're getting off except it has your name on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:04 - 01:21:06]** Nick's going to be a starship designer in the future.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:06 - 01:21:08]** Yeah, Nick starship designer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:08 - 01:21:09]** Yeah.

**[01:21:10 - 01:21:19]** Rick is going to ring the doorbell or knock or however you would address these of Trostenex.

**[01:21:19 - 01:21:21]** Of Trostenex?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:21 - 01:21:22]** Whatever.

**[01:21:22 - 01:21:23]** Trostenex.

**[01:21:24 - 01:21:24]** Yes.

**[01:21:24 - 01:21:25]** Trostenex.

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:27]** Trostenex room.

**[01:21:27 - 01:21:28]** Okay, so Dr. O.K.

**[01:21:28 - 01:21:33]** and Rick, you're standing in the hallway where there are eight guest quarters, the southern two doors.

**[01:21:33 - 01:21:35]** The one on the left is Professor Benjamin's.

**[01:21:35 - 01:21:37]** The one on the right is Trostenex's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:37 - 01:21:40]** Yeah, so he is going to knock on Trostenec's room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:40 - 01:21:42]** Trostenec's room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:42 - 01:21:42]** Okay.

**[01:21:42 - 01:21:44]** However you say it.

**[01:21:44 - 01:21:45]** Trostenec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:21:45 - 01:21:45]** Trostenec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:46 - 01:21:53]** I'm going to prepare, just before that, my concealable syringe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:54 - 01:21:55]** Did you tell Rick that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:56 - 01:21:56]** No.

**[01:21:56 - 01:21:56]** No.

**[01:21:57 - 01:22:01]** I'm telling the DM that.

**[01:22:01 - 01:22:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:01 - 01:22:09]** So Rick is going to lift his hand towards the button or however he's going to... Let's say he's pushing a button to ring the doorbell.

**[01:22:10 - 01:22:20]** He's going to reach for that, look directly at the sign that says Trostenec, and look back at Dr. Okay and nod at him.

**[01:22:21 - 01:22:22]** Oh, nice.

**[01:22:22 - 01:22:23]** And then he's going to ring the doorbell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:24 - 01:22:24]** Okay.

**[01:22:24 - 01:22:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:22:27 - 01:22:30]** Good job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:32 - 01:22:32]** And that's game.

**[01:22:32 - 01:22:35]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:35 - 01:22:36]** No.


## Speaker_0

**[01:22:36 - 01:22:36]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:22:36 - 01:22:38]** Well done, Josh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:38 - 01:22:40]** I should have done a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:41 - 01:22:48]** Well, it has been a long rest since you've heard from me, your game master and referee of role play, John Swan.

**[01:22:48 - 01:22:51]** And I got to say, what an episode.

**[01:22:51 - 01:22:57]** I've been waiting for that eavesdrop moment and for asking people to take off their headphones ever since episode one.

**[01:22:57 - 01:23:01]** Hey, we all want to say thank you for listening and joining us at the table this first month.

**[01:23:02 - 01:23:06]** If you have at all found yourself laughing with or at us or Nick, let us know with a review.

**[01:23:06 - 01:23:09]** It's remarkable how much one Apple review can do for a show.

**[01:23:10 - 01:23:15]** So let's hear from you, all of you, especially you, Dwayne The Rock Johnson, and we'll see you next We'll Save Wednesday.

**[01:23:15 - 01:23:15]** We'll Save Wednesday.
