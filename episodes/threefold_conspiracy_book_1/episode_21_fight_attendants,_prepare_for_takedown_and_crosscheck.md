**[00:00:00 - 00:00:06]** Last time on We'll Save, the thriller continues.

**[00:00:06 - 00:00:13]** Suspense builds in the secret room where our adventurers found Captain Ramin dead.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:16]** But his itchy trigger fingers twitch.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:26]** Unanswered questions get the better of the team when they discover that the mysterious figure opening the secret door

**[00:00:26 - 00:00:30]** is none other than the would-be incarcerated Trostenek.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:39]** However, the confusion ends when Trostenek attacks the group, calling them meddlers.

**[00:00:40 - 00:00:42]** Who does Trostenek really work for?

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:48]** Loyalties will be revealed this time on Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:41]** It's episode 21.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:43]** It's all about the drink now.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:48]** Our podcast can legally drink in the United States of America.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:55]** We were able to do that since episode 18 for everyone listening in other parts of the world.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** Some gin for Nick.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:02]** Some gin, beer, whatever your poison of choice.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** Whatever your poison of choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:07]** Gin, gin, gin, gin, gin, gin, gin, gin, gin.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** Is that what that song is about?

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:10]** Gin Chiroga.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:11]** Gin Chiroga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:19]** Gin Chiroga was actually an alcohol influencer for a distillery that made gin.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:21]** That's why her name was Gin Chiroga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** Her untimely death.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** I got one more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** You guys ready for it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:24]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** Gin, gin, gin is magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:29]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** You know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** I like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:36]** Never believe it's not so.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:40]** I was actually going to go like, ginger is something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** It fits.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** The syllables fit, right?

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:42]** It's good.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** For the audience, I don't know if you know this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** Nick is actually a professional singer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:49]** Oh, oh, oh, it's magic.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** It's such a good song.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** Who sings that, though?

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:56]** Never believe it's not so.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:56]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** Electric Light Orchestra?

**[00:02:59 - 00:02:59]** No.

**[00:02:59 - 00:02:59]** Is it?

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:00]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** I don't think it's ELO.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:02]** Is it ELO?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** I think so.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** It doesn't sound like them, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** It's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Oh, maybe it is.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:11]** But apparently they and Pilot did it or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** I don't know who that is.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** Yeah, Pilot.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** It's Magic.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** Pilot.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** It's Magic.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:17]** Thank you, Pilot.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** If there's an ELL version.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** Yeah, there is it.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** No, Strange Magic is ELL.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** Strange Magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:26]** Strange Magic.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:29]** Got a strange magic.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:29]** That's Magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:33]** That should be a podcast name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** Strange Magic?

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** It probably is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** It's magic.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** Top pop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:39]** We'll just make it our next podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:41]** It's a band full of wizards.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** Everybody has to be a magic wizard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** We're just all bards.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** I love music from the 70s, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:52]** Today's musical moment is brought to you by Shazam!

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:52]** It's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** Wait, the superhero Shazam?

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:54]** It's not.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** Superhero Shazam.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** What is he, a genie or something?

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** What is he?

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** I feel like... I forget.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:01]** You forget what?

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:04]** If Shazam is a genie or a superhero.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:05]** Superhero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:13]** Shazam is... Shazam is actually the god Shazam, and he gives his powers to...

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:19]** And actually, Shazam is an acronym of the first letters of multiple gods.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:24]** So Z is Zeus' strength, and A is Achilles' speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:27]** Kevin's our resident comic book expert, so that's why.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:29]** Way too much information.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** Not everything.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:31]** You do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:35]** I like how one person was like, everything, and one person was like, it's way too much.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** So...

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** I mean, it's fine.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:42]** You just know a lot, and you buy trades, and you're all up in the world.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:42]** I'm just kind of a nerd.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** That's what nerds do.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** That's what we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:48]** We buy things and read stuff and listen to things and watch things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:50]** Record things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Love stuff.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** Record things, yeah.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** We drink and we know things.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:56]** Podcast things, you know.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:57]** I got a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** Uh-oh.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** What was your role from last week?

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]** Yeah, I want to know that too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:05]** Yeah, let's get into it.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** There was nothing of important about last week's ending.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:09]** It was very normal.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Uneventful ending.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** Rick's about to die.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** Are you kidding me?

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** Here's my question.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** That hammer is insane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:19]** John, I do not... That hammer is one of my favorite weapons thus far.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:20]** Looks amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:24]** I do not appreciate you being so cavalier with Kev's life.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** Kev's life?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:26]** My life?

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** I'm all invested in Kev's life.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** Rick's life, though.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** Here's his life.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:32]** Debatable.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** I want to bring something up because I want to ask.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:43]** There is a question that I have for your characters.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:47]** As we much lamented, I think it was episode four, maybe five.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:50]** I think we were all like, oh, boo, asking questions of characters.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:52]** And I was like, this is really awesome.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** I don't know why we're all booing it.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:54]** Wait, did we do that?

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:55]** You did.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:57]** You did.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:57]** Yeah.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** How dare you?

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** I don't believe you.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** That's cool.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** Too bad there's no record of it.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:02]** We can't go back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** Liar!

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** So I have a question for your characters.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** Too bad I can't go listen to it right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:09]** Yeah.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** Here's your question.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:17]** And I'm going to lead because I'm just going to talk about me because I am so many characters that I'll just be my own character.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:18]** But here's my question.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** You should have to do it in every character.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:23]** Oh, wow.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** From where?

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:27]** Just from the start of book one or book one through book six now?

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** We're already on book six?

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:33]** No, I'm talking about all the characters we've seen so far.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** Don't spoil it.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:34]** Okay, that's fine.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** But you have to do it in every voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** Here's the question.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:43]** What is one hope that your character has for the future?

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:51]** And I'll start by saying that me, my hope for all of my characters, are that we follow the rules.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:57]** And this goes for every character, and that's that we follow the rules.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:01]** And I think that we will.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** And of course, we're going to mess up a little bit.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** It's OK.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:13]** That's why email was invented, was to give flack through a computer where the files exist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:18]** Who would like to go next for the hope that your character has?

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:26]** So Rick is sitting in a room by himself and looking straight at the camera because it's one of those moments, right?

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** So nobody else is hearing this.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:29]** Close your ears, all your characters.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:38]** But Rick looks at the camera and one of my greatest hopes for the near future is that I find my family.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:38]** Dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** The camera then switches.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** Who does it switch to next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** It's gonna switch to Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** A professional slug appears in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** Professional slug.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:53]** I...

**[00:07:55 - 00:08:16]** troubled by the events of the past few days and I think back and recollect to my home planet and my colleague leaving and seeing our goods it draws me out but also makes me concerned for like my people


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:25]** Yeah, because as was discussed, I think several times, Osiris typically don't go out on their own.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:28]** So the fact that this drew you out into the world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:35]** But I'm holding like an artifact of my people in my home world.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:37]** Right.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:37]** What?

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:40]** Like that diorama med pack.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** What was it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** The healing serum.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:44]** The diorama healing serum?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** Yeah.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** Yeah.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** The region one drew my colleague out.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** So, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:51]** Yeah.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** That's what I'm thinking about.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:56]** Yeah, because your colleague also left by himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** Dang, we're dropping some bombs right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:59 - 00:08:59]** Curious.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:00]** The camera.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** That's just like a little PSA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:27]** This message was brought to you by the free captains.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** I like taking notes on all this stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:32]** I want to learn everything about your characters.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:35]** For everyone taking notes at home, keep taking notes.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** Camera switches.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:37]** Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:44]** Nico's just like, I want to take back my company and I want to kill my mom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:49]** And I want to provide a lot of dividends to my stockholders.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** Kill your mom?

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** I want to be a shareholder of Nick's company.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:55]** Menendez brothers of role-playing characters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** Mattress side?

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:57]** Mattress side.

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:00]** Not killing mattresses here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:13]** I'm not going to lie, that is one of the most, yeah, that is probably one of the most, I mean, these were all bold statements, and I'm glad that it turned into a little story time from some backstories.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** But killing your mom, it's heavy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Yeah, that's a hope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** I hope I kill my mom.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:21]** Well, she's kind of a terrible person.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:25]** Yeah, Nico kind of feels like his mom just tried to have him killed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** But does Nico know that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** Nico assumes that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** Nico has assumed things before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:35]** A lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:41]** Well, we all have, to be fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:41]** I'm not going to lie.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:44]** I'm excited for now.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** I mean, I've been excited for this podcast for months.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:51]** But at this point, I'm starting to get nervous before episodes because I'm like...

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** Get really excited because I'm just excited for the story.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:07]** Just excited for all the bombs, all the good, good story, fun times, crazy roles, the character deaths that are going to happen.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** Stoked.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:16]** But seriously, I am actually just I think I was talking about the the character yeses that will happen.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:19]** The yeses that come from characters as they embrace life.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** So last time, we're just going to cut right to it.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:24]** Last time.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** Can we delay some more?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** Why do you want to delay?

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:29]** I don't want to delay.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** No, stop.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** The first five minutes of the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:32]** Here it is.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** We're 10 minutes in, so you're already safe.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:35]** It's fine.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:47]** So we obviously ended last time with you all confronting Trostenec and then

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** fighting Drostenick.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:54]** And we ended in the middle of this fight.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** We ended... Sorry?

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** No, we didn't.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** I should have shot him sooner.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** You all did not start it.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:10]** He started it when he looked over and said, Curse you, meddlers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** You just couldn't let it all go.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** Scooby-Doo moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** For the purposes of this podcast, Rick shot first.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:22]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:23]** Fair point.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** That's canon now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:28]** It's canon.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:28]** Let's play.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** So I made a roll.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** Against Rick.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** Moved over.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** I'm getting there.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:39]** Y'all always rush me on this map moment.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** This has happened a bunch.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:43]** Y'all always rush me.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** You're always rushing me on the map.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** Where's the map?

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** Here's the map.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** The same map.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** Didn't change.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** Didn't psych you out.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** But here's the thing.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:56]** Trostenec stepped over, shambled over with the encumbered condition.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:58]** Took some heavy steps.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:01]** Bleeding acid on his armor.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:09]** Trying to collect his strength as he lowers the hammer and walks over to Rick and goes to swing it.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** And I made a roll.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** But right as I made that roll, Kev raised his hand.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** And what did you want to ask?

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:17]** I'm just before you're trying to delay.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:17]** It's fine.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:21]** It's actually like previous episode stuff is what did you like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:25]** Did you reduce his armor or whatever to the lowest dexterity because of using cupboard?

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:26]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:32]** And minus 2 because he was flat-footed, and minus 10 feet because he was moving, but he did move from where he was.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** He can move 20 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** Doesn't Kev have cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** From here?

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** No.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:39]** And also from this melee.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** From this melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:48]** I'm also going to say, if someone's bleeding acid, they're going to be very, very popular and in demand in the drug trade.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** Just saying.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** That's very true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Wait, he's bleeding acid?

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:53]** Did I miss that?

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:55]** No, there was acid.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:55]** He's bleeding.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:59]** There's acid burning on his skin from the cost of jet.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:01]** There was some magic missiles.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** There's some tactical azimuth laser pistols.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** All this stuff.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:09]** I think John did a wordplay there where he said he was bleeding acid and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** You did the wordplay.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** I gave you the words.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** You play with them.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** That's what I do, John.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** I know.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** I know you do.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:19]** Giddy up.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** I made a roll.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** We ended on that roll.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** I didn't give you the roll.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** This music is bumming me out.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:31]** We really need some more intense music right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** All right, I'll fix it.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** I'll get it in India.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** I'll get it in India.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** Damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** No, it's okay.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:40]** I'm already changing it.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:44]** Well, I can't stall forever, Kev.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** I can't stall forever, Rick.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** You want to know what I rolled?

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:48]** No.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** You want to know what I rolled?

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:51]** Okay, go for it.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Just say it.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** I rolled a natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:57]** Yes!

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:57]** What?

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** You think I would lie about that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:58]** Come on.


## Speaker_0

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:58]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** That's why you ended the episode.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** No joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:03]** Critical, critical, critical, critical, critical, critical fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** Shame.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** Fumble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** Happens to our dear Trostnick on his birthday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** I got the cards.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:12]** I'm going to just in front of you all so you know I'm actually doing it.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** I'm going to stop.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:15]** Three, two, one, stop.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** Boom.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** That's my card.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:19]** I'm using the official Paizo deck, critical fumble deck.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:24]** We shuffle and then flip through them.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Thanks, Paizo.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** It's awesome.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Thank you, Paizo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:28]** I really like your deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** You're great, Paizo.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:31]** You're the best, Paizo.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** Wow, this is...

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:34]** Okay.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:35]** So good.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** Here is my question.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:51]** Because this weapon deals both energy and bludgeoning damage, the Paizo deck is based on, you know, what type of damage do you do?

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:56]** And I'm looking to see which one makes... Because there are two, right?

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:58]** There's like a kinetic and there's an...

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:58]** Energy.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:00]** I think I'm just going to roll a d6.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:04]** I'm going to say 1 to 3 is kinetic, 4 to 6 is energy.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** I like your way of thinking, John.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** The dice decide.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** That's a 5.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:10]** So that is energy.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:20]** Right on the funny bone, you take half weapon damage and move one step down the dexterity poison track until healed.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** Holy cow.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** What did I just do to myself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:27]** You also have like a minus 5 to dex saves, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:35]** Yeah, but I don't make a dex save, but I need to look up to see what the Dexterity Poison track does.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:43]** But I also need to give myself half damage, which I'm not going to lie, this is no bueno.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:47]** This is what a lot of people call... Because his damage is like 4d6 or something stupid.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:50]** Okay, that is four points of damage to myself.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Oh, that's it?

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:51]** Okay.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:56]** So as he swings, he must have just stepped, tripped, it swings, it hits his leg.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:06]** Rick, you hear this crunch as his leg just seems to almost collapse underneath him, and he struggles to right himself.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:11]** And while I look up the Dexterity Poison track on page 415 of the Starfinder Core rulebook, we're going to move.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:15]** In round three, we're going to move to Hears.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** What are you doing, Hears?

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:17]** Excuse me?

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:18]** Where'd Rick go?

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:20]** Rick, we were in round three.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** Yeah, you were at the top of the round, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:23]** I thought you were saying we started in a new round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** No, we didn't start in a new round.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** What are you talking about?

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** I misheard you.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:26]** It's okay.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:26]** It's okay.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** Hears, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** Just so excited to go again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:36]** Here's is going to telepathically tell everyone, because I think I can do this and attack.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:37]** Okay.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** Hey, it's here's.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:44]** Because I don't think they know I can telepathically do things yet.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** I'm a telepath, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:47]** You've done it a few times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:47]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Yeah, I feel like you've done it.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** Hey, it's here's.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:55]** Let's not kill him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:55 - 00:18:11]** okay oh all right hey doctor okay hi yeah yeah let's not kill him let's keep him alive okay all right and then he's going to uh communication like like i don't know is this a cantrip or like what is this it's just like a racial feat that i have

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:40]** I am I'm sure let's let's let's read into it as you are sure while we're looking into it what are you going to do on your turn here's this going to fire a magic missile again which won't be a problem with these crates because they're basically homing beacons yeah they're homing missile beacons and he shall do that and given the fact that that was a racial feat he could take a full action to do this magic missile since telepathy was not like an action I guess

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** Okay, find out.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** Actually, I don't know.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:47]** Full action, so that's 3d4 plus 3.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:49]** 3d4 plus 3, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** Which is 10 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** Are you trying to do non-lethal or lethal damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** Non-lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** Can you do non-lethal damage with a spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** That's a really good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:05]** I believe so, but I think you have to take a hit to... Yeah, but the thing is that you don't roll for...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:13]** I'll have to roll to attack for Magic Missile.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** No, I don't think you do.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** So you instantly hit Magic Missile.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** There might be something in here.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:19]** So how does that go with non-lethal?


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:19]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:23]** I don't see anything about telepathy that says you can't do it.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** I don't really know where it plays into.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:29]** So you can kind of just communicate with people through telepathy.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** Yeah, it's fun stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:32]** Anyways, what are we looking up again?

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:38]** We're trying to figure out if Magic Missile can do non-lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:40]** It just says it reduces you to zero or fewer.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:45]** You're reduced to exactly zero health points and fall unconscious, but you're stable instead of dying.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Okay.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:49]** So somehow we can just choose that, which is kind of interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:49]** Okay.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:51]** So you were trying to do non-lethal damage.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** I'm going to say this.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:56]** Rick, in front of you, the hammer swings.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** He stumbles.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** It hits his leg.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** You hear the sickening crack.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:06]** And at that moment, these missiles hit Trostenec in the back.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:10]** And Trostenec falls to his knees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:13]** Oh, yes.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:15]** That's what I'm talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** And he is dead.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:40]** Almost unconscious because as he falls, he kind of struggles, coughs up some blood, blinks, clutches his wounds at the acid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:44]** You can't stop us.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:47]** This means nothing.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:51]** The rest of us will be here any second.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:52]** Oh, shit.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:56]** The starfishers will make sure you run.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** Starfishers, write that down.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:57]** And drift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** Writing it down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:11]** And then as Trostenek falls and slumps forward, his hands catch and he's on all fours.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:25]** And Rick, like an octopus, Trostenec's skin begins to quickly cycle through several colors, green, black, purple, before landing on pink.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:29]** Each hand begins to kind of suck blood.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:44]** back into the arm and each foot you see kind of sucks back into his leg and what pink skin you can see underneath the armor seems to become bumpy and scaly and their head shrinks

**[00:21:44 - 00:22:12]** into their neck as their upper body seems to hunch forward even more almost like a dog as three more appendages you see burst from their chest each with some membranes that are kind of hanging off and the seams of their clothes at their knees and their elbows rip and an eye appears in the middle of each of their appendage and whatever was their face seems to have uh there are no eyes

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:14]** But the eyes are on the appendages.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:17]** And the eyes are blinking, closing quickly.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:18]** The wounds are still there.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** You see the acid marks.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:26]** And they look like this.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:31]** In the bottom corner, I'm showing you what they look like.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** Oh, my God.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:33]** Ew.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** It's so ugly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:37]** Brainy-looking octopus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** So you all are not there.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:44]** And as this happens, this creature falls unconscious, as you know.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** It does kind of look like a starfish, yeah.

**[00:22:46 - 00:23:14]** unconscious you all are out of combat and out of the initiative order i'm going to move this creature over to in front of rick what do you oh my god i think it's gross so nico's gonna walk over to rick and say you're right there i am fine thank you what is what does nico do when nico sees this creature nico's just gonna say hello ugly do we have any idea what this thing is


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** Here's Roll's life science.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** Dr. O'Keefe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** Yeah, I'll do a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** I'll do a life science check as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** Just 10.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** 10?

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:25]** Despite my great modifier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:32]** And I'll use, actually, my polymath ability.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** So I'll automatically succeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** Your what ability?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** Once per day, I can... Tell us about polymath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:47]** automatically succeed at an attempt of intelligence-based skill check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** But what's your roll?

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** But I rolled an 18.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:55]** Plus 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:56]** Wow.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** Okay.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:57]** Great.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:57]** Excellent.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:02]** Looking at this strange creature.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:06]** Again, eyes are... I'm going to show it here.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** Shift Z it.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:10]** No eyes where its head is.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:12]** The eyes are on the appendages.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** There are seven of them.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** There's sort of a mouthy maw underneath it.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** This creature is covered.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:21]** It's like hairy, but also wet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:25]** It's certainly slimy enough to have been that thing crawling through the vents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:31]** I mean, you probably took a sample of it from the... Yeah, can I sample him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:36]** I'll tell you what you know from your lifetime check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:40]** I haven't even said anything about what you know, and you're like, let's just sample it.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:42]** Let's just buy out of it.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** Cut it in half.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:48]** This creature is currently unconscious but stable, as a reminder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:49]** Okay.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:56]** I can also use my custom micro lab to... Let me tell you what you know first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** Let me tell you what you know first.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** So, you know this creature, Dr. O.K.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:09]** To be an astrozoan, they are... And Google it, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** I'm just typing a note.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:12]** Uh-huh.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:12]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** I swear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** It's fine.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** It's fine.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:18]** They're kind of like a human-sized starfish.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** They're new to the packed worlds.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:33]** New in the sense that there's no record of them entering really any sort of established or formal method into the packed worlds government or as a civilization.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:38]** Yeah, they don't even have records of their beginnings, possibly sometime during the gap.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:41]** They don't really have any sort of way of culture.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** They just woke up.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:46]** They're always trying to strive to find their place in the galaxy.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:53]** But they don't really – the reason that you aren't quite sure how many of them exist and they seem very rare, and it kind of pings your mind.

**[00:25:53 - 00:26:06]** You're like, I feel like I might have heard of them once or twice because they know that they are so off-putting that they shape change because they don't want to be seen as an outcast or an outsider.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** And so they can become almost anything.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** That's sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** They should be more confident in themselves.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** I almost would have sympathy for them then if they didn't try to murder us.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:29]** But the interesting thing, that's true, the interesting thing is that yes, whatever is on their skin, this viscous fluid, you do recall is similar to the fluid that was found in Algiata's vent in her room.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:40]** And what's more, you do recall that these things can compress to be pretty small, so it makes sense that this creature could make its way through the vents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** Can I pick up that hammer?


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** For sure.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** So this creature is unconscious in front of you.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** You guys want to search the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:49]** Yeah.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** I'm going to pick up the hammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** You're grabbing the hammer?

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** Yeah, let's start with his body and then we'll go to the room.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** You reach down into this wet, gooey body.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:02]** There is a defrex hide armor.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** Defrex hide.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:07]** There's a tactical semi-auto pistol.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:13]** that they threw on the ground at the beginning, so it has 17 rounds.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:19]** There's a key card that you presume doesn't look like your key card to your room.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** It's probably to the smuggler compartment.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:25]** And then this hammer is a diamagnetic storm hammer.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:30]** Pretty freaking awesome weapon.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:32]** If it doesn't weigh 300 pounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** What?

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** If it doesn't weigh 300 pounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:38]** I think it probably has 14 or 16 charges.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** I think it had three attacks with it, three swings.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:41]** What did you say it was again?

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:44]** Diamagnetic Stormhammer.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:47]** It's a sweet, sweet weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:48]** What was the armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:49 - 00:28:09]** defrex hide and are you all looking around in the room like look like going through the containers or are you just looking around because you looked around a bit before the whole thing see what we got okay okay and are you searching the captain are you just gonna leave the captain for now what are you doing search the captain you want to search the captain

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:15]** I'm going to read this off quick because I don't want to, I want to get back to the story, but this is, you find a lot of stuff.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:24]** Looking through all the crates takes you maybe 10 minutes and looking through the captain, maybe closer to 20.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:30]** And you find an auto target rifle with 30 long arm rounds.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:34]** You find a flash dazzler.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:39]** You find a suit of Kasatha micro cord one.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:45]** You find a jump jets armor upgrade.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** It's pretty sweet.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:54]** You find a grappler with 50 feet of adamantine alloy cable line.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:56]** You find a laser drill.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** You find three batteries.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:01]** These are the batteries that you would use for any powered weapons.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:06]** And you also find a grenade scrambler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** Grenade scrambler?

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** That was so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:14]** We'll deal with it after the app.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:18]** I want to find it on the page and read everything about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:20]** Well, just do it in a bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** Some of these things...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** Are pretty sweet.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:35]** Look, there are also a bunch of boxes have, like, clothes, Kasathan clothing, other clothing from, you know, Castroville, seems like, Versys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** Didn't we search the room last time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** Yeah, but you didn't search in the boxes.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:43]** Any fine business or professional slug clothing for the man about town?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:45]** No, there's no professional slug clothing.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:49]** Last time you all, when you first came in, you did search the room, but you didn't search in the boxes.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** This is going through the boxes.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** This is taking time.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** And you all didn't want to take that time last time.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:58]** So some of the clothing is damaged.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:00]** There's some blood stains even on some of it.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:08]** And then there are some cheap souvenirs probably from, you know, Absalom Station and from Leovara and Breathida.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:10]** There's like, or Breathida.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:15]** There's, you know, little like trinkets and kitsch things.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:20]** And you all give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:20]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:25]** I'm back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:27]** Natural 20, 25 for perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** Eight for Hughes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** Plus six, that's a 20 for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:41]** Okay, Nico and Kev, Rick, you find...

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:50]** buried at the bottom of one of these crates there's an old cred stick quick look it's 5,000 credits

**[00:30:50 - 00:31:17]** wait who found this both nico and rick you both notice this at the same time so you all have have an unconscious astrozoan that was a vesk that is now also an astrozoan and all this stuff we can go over it later what what do you guys want to do what let's i want to put it on we can do that later i know uh so what happens


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:23]** Nico's going to sheathe his sword and put away his blaster, and he's going to walk back over to the room with the ladder in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:24]** Okay.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** Yeah.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:25]** What's up here?

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:27]** What do you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** What do you guys say?

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:30]** To each other?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:36]** Maybe we should see whether there's accesses in the ship.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:44]** We should be careful for traps or smuggler tomfoolery.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:46]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** Dr.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:50]** O.K., do you have any idea how we can contain this creature?

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:53]** It is a shapeshifter, after all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:59]** Would I be able to do some sort of knowledge?

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:03]** Like, could I reliably know that from a life science?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:07]** I'd say if you wanted to do a knowledge engineering check, you could try and think of something to make.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:10]** I can think of just, like, shoving it in a crate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:13]** If you wanted to do that, you could.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:14]** Or engineering.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:15]** 26.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:20]** Yeah.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:29]** Knowing that their compression ability, it would make sense that they need to be in a place where there are little to no holes that they can get through.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** I mean, they can't squeeze through a pinhole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** Do they require oxygen to live?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:36]** Do they require oxygen to live?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:38]** Can we just put them in an airtight container?

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** You can put them in an airtight container if you want.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:48]** I will say that, yes, I think they do require oxygen to live.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:54]** Unless somebody who is listening knows otherwise.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:01]** Then if that's the case, if we can't move it, maybe we should ask it questions now before going up the ladder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** I mean, you can move it.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:05]** You could put it in a container.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:05]** You could kill it.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:06]** You could do whatever you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** Yeah, but it could escape through holes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** But I'll say this.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:16]** The vent that it went through, that it compressed, was not very big at all.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:17]** Let me look.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** Like a giant kimchi container.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:21]** Could we just put them in one of those?

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:48]** you could the the vent was like a foot wide and you know six a foot by six inches foot by half a foot so anything smaller than that likely wouldn't be able to get through it can't compress itself that small but it can't compress itself pretty small just don't put it in one with a big vent um okay is there anything in the room we can check out it looks like there's some like small containers in that pillar next to nico

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:53]** Yet, what I told you that you found is indicative of all the stuff that's in the room.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** You found everything that's in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:59]** Because Rick saw everything with his robotic eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:02]** I thought he wasn't a robot, though.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:07]** Let's place this man in this container.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** Hilarious.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** Is he dead?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** Yes.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** No, he's currently unconscious and stable.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:14]** We want to interview him, so, yeah.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** Let's shove him in something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:19]** Do you want to try and talk to him while he's in here, or...?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:23]** I mean, okay, so yeah, I'm super down to talk to him, and then we can go up the ladder.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:24]** I don't think it'll take that long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** What do you guys say?

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:32]** Someone needs to tell me not to come over, because I don't know this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:40]** All right, here's telepathically tells Nico, hey, let's talk to the squid, the starfish first, before we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:43]** Nico, a little alarmed, is like,

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:44]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** He can talk in his head.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** Yeah, we went through this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:53]** So here's kind of like takes out the sword and kind of taps him awake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:55]** We'll still have his gun out and pointed at him.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:58]** And he's got the hammer in his pocket now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:03]** has his syringe stick.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** I call my tactical dueling sword, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** And you're putting it in which crate?

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** This crate right here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:12]** No, I thought we were going to question him first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Stick him in a crate.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:16]** We'll put him in a crate that we think we can seal him in.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** Yeah, but what if something happens?

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:19]** We'll just leave the lid off for now.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:24]** Niko's gonna look at everybody else here and he's like, hey guys, I got this.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:25]** Let me take the lead on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Go sweet talking, fly boy.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:32]** So you put him in a crate and you wake him up.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:32]** Yes?

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:35]** Okay.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:35]** Weapon's drawn.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** Oki.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** Mine is concealed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:40]** Oki.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** My weapon.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** Concealed weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** It has a concealed property.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:50]** The eyes slowly blink open.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** And the mouth.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** And it kind of starts to talk.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** It sees all of you with its seven eyes.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:07]** It starts to talk in Trostenec's voice, but also the voice frequently kind of changes pitch or intonation.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** It's still...

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:10]** Stable, but still hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:15]** So, Nico's going to look at this thing as he's waking up.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** He's going to be like, oh, you're awake.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** Good afternoon.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** You don't look so good.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** You can still look worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** You never stood a chance, you know.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** You never stood a chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:30]** You don't look so good for someone who's saying you don't have a chance.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:30]** And you know what?

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:34]** The fact of the matter is, you might still look a good deal worse.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:41]** However, me and my friends here are willing to play ball a little bit, and we're willing to have a nice conversation.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:45]** If you're not willing to engage in such, we'll just end your existence.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** Do I make myself clear?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** We will take...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:55]** Hold precious and leave you with nothing.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:56]** Who's we?

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:58]** Who's we?

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:00]** And he's going to roll a diplomacy check here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:03]** What are you doing with your diplomacy check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** Or intimidation.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:06]** Pick your thing here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:08]** Well, you pick.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Do you just want to ask?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** I'm just asking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** You can just ask who's we.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:16]** Because I kind of intimidated him with we'll just end your existence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** True.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** That was his response, though, and then you asked that.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:23]** All right.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** So when you say, who's we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:41]** He goes, me, Kroop, and there's someone else aboard, and someone else is coming.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:45]** Who else is coming?

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:46]** Pray tell us.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:54]** And by the way, just so you know what's on the line here, we happen to have a doctor in this room right here.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** This doctor knows how to heal people.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** He can make you better.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** Or he can make you dead.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** Your call.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:07]** And he looks over at Dr. OK and nods.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:10]** Lou, the starfishers.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** They're coming.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** They're almost here.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:21]** Who are these starfishers, and what's your allegiance to them?

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:25]** Allegiance?

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** I am a starfisher.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:30]** And why are you a starfisher?

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:34]** What dirt do they have on you to make you want to die for them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** Nothing's worse than death, buddy.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:37]** That's the whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:47]** We're pirates, and we're going to take your ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:49]** And at that moment, you all hear...

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** Seems to come from a deck above you.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** A small explosion.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** Maybe towards the dining hall area.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** There's a brief flicker in the lights.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:07]** And then the lights come back to their emergency status.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:15]** And you just hear this faint laughing from Cub.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:20]** Niko's going to look at the rest of the group, and he's just going to say his opinion here.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:22]** He's like, all right, he's no use to us alive.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** Let's go ahead and let's kill him.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** Wait, wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:29]** Because I think Rick was about to just shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:45]** So here's his, like... No, Rick was going to... Rick shoves his... I guess he does it right after Niko says that, but Rick shoves his artillery laser with this big, you know, massive weapon and kind of squeezes it into the middle of this creature and says...

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:48]** Who else on board have you been impersonating?

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:55]** Drosten Neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:57]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:59]** What about your friends?

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** And I'll roll an intimidation...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:06]** And Here's, what were you about to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:10]** Yeah, Here's wants to know, like, who are the others?

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** Who are your friends?

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** Which ones?

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Which ones are you impersonating?

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:17]** Are they impersonating?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:27]** So I got an intimidate plus three, so I got a 22 for intimidation, and I squeezed the rifle further into his body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** Okay, you got a 23?

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** 22.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:29]** 22.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:36]** With a 22... I got plus two for him because I assisted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:37]** Okay.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** What do you do to assist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:45]** Looking menacing with my hand kind of brushing against the butt of my blaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:50]** Okay, that was more than enough to get it.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:57]** He, or they, kind of... That was me actually coughing.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:58]** From that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:04]** Captain Ramian.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:09]** And Algie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** Stop.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** Stop.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** Why should we leave you alive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:25]** So I can take everything from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:31]** Rick is going to kind of glance at the others because he's never comfortable with just killing.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:35]** But that's just a threat we can't deal with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:38]** Yeah, Nico's just going to go ahead and he's just going to nod toward Rick.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:49]** And then he'll glance over at Dr. O'Kane like, unless you have a more painful method of him to be taking everything away from him as he so threatens us with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** That's a pretty big statement.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** I'm just going to say.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:56]** You're asking me to kill this person?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** You want to torture him?

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:57]** Is that what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** Yeah, you're saying you want to torture him.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** By the way, you guys did do this to the goblin.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:03]** You did ask a couple questions to the space goblin, and then you're like, poof, you just shot.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:06]** Yeah, Nico shot, right?

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:08]** I think Nico just poof, shot.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:09]** Yeah.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:12]** I don't mean a big thing in the sense that it's bad.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:17]** I'm just saying, like, let's just all note here, like, Nico's moving down a path of, like, retribution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** Which is not bad, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:22]** It just is.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:23]** One more thing.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:27]** Do you know why Lozu was acting so weird?

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:28]** Was that you?

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** Was that you guys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:34]** I'll roll to assist for intimidation on that one.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** I'll do that one.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:35]** Okay.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:39]** I succeeded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** Okay, this is what I picture.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:49]** Here's you lean over, because this is, I think, the first time that you've, not the first time that you've asked a question, but you ask it and the eyes turn and look at you.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:51]** And then, Rick, you don't do anything.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:55]** And the Astrozoan cub is quiet.

**[00:42:55 - 00:43:03]** And then Nico just grabs it and just pushes the artillery laser into the Astrozoan.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:07]** Mozu is weak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:09]** She is nothing.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:16]** But she was close to being onto us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** She would have died.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:24]** Nico's going to look over at everybody.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** I've heard enough.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** If you guys aren't going to kill him, I am.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** Oh, I'd love to kill him.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** You got the last one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:54]** rick rick is gonna kind of just like back i'm gonna ask him about the the items on the ship so rick rick starts drawing his rifle back and then as soon as dr okay speaks up he pushes the rifle back down wait i do have one more question damn it go okay go dr okay yeah what question do you have is going to what do you say dr okay um so his he has eyes right like he could see us

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** He has seven eyes on his appendages.

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** On his appendages.

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:04]** So I'm going to take one of his appendages in my sort of like grasp, you know, sort of softly.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:10]** Hold a syringe up to his eyeball.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** Okay.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:18]** With sort of an intimidating sort of sneer looking down at him.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:24]** And I'm going to ask him, what can you tell me about the supplies?

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** On this ship.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** Where did you get these?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** We didn't get anything.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:37]** We want the supplies.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** We will take them all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:43]** Do you want the relic?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** We want everything.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** Including the relic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** Do you know where the relic is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:56]** I think cargo hold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Nico's going to follow up.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** Why this ship in particular?

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:03]** You could have hit any number of ships.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:06]** We hit all the ships.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** We want all of them.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** All right.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:12]** This guy's just non-discriminative.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** He's crossed us.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:15]** He's threatened us again.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:20]** Let's show him and his pirate allies just what we think of this type of piracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:23]** I am not comfortable with capital punishment without proper processing.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** What process do you want?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:30]** He was going to process our bodies and use them to kill everybody else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:34]** I tend to agree, but we could just space them, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** Let them suck vacuum?

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** I don't know what's more messed up.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Can you breathe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** Are you able to survive in the vacuum of space?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** I can do that.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:48]** I can identify that from a life science check, can I?

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:51]** I thought that we said that she needed air.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:53]** Yeah, it does need air.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:59]** Here's just kind of like twirls around his saber and is like, hmm.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** And then like really wants to stab him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** He kind of looks at Nico.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:08]** He's going to just pull the rifle back and put one hand up like, I'm out of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:12]** They don't kill unarmed, restrained people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:16]** Well, it looks like you're not going to be the one to kill him then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:19]** Despite their murderousness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:23]** Nico's going to look over at Hears and he's going to be like, What'd you say, Nico?

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:26]** Take your time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:33]** Hears just takes the edge of the blade and just starts shoving it into its head slowly.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** Bit by bit.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** Flops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** And it dies.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:50]** And you have a dead Kasathan and a dead Astrozoan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:57]** I wanted to also attune my custom micro lab to his biology.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** How long does that take?

**[00:46:59 - 00:46:59]** 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:01]** Okay.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:03]** So you guys sit for 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** You guys, can we do a short rest in that time?

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:05]** Or no?

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** 10 minutes is not long enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:09]** It's not a short rest per se.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** It's a 10-minute rest to regain stamina points.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Okay.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** I can use this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** Expand your resolve point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** Yeah, you need to spend a resolve point.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:19]** My question, don't forget, that's what you did after the Jincharoga fight.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:21]** I kind of wanted to do some of this while he was alive, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:25]** How many stamina points did we get?

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** He's dead now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** What are you trying to do?

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:34]** You said you went to sample it before we started even talking to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:49]** If you all take 10 minutes to regain stamina points, you can deliver biohacks using ranged ejection weapons without making an attack roll with attunement according to the rulebook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:56]** So that would mean that you could make an attack against another Astrozoan without, but you would need to know that it's an Astrozoan.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:02]** And sorry, how much I, being the rules lawyer, I also have a terrible memory.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:06]** So what's the rule with regaining?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:14]** You can regain, you spend 10 minutes, you regain all of your stamina points at the cost of one resolve point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:15]** Oh, man.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** Resolve points don't really get you.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** When do resolve points get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:24]** We don't use them right now, but later on, some feats and actions require them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:24]** Yeah.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:28]** Or if you go down, you spend a resolve point to either stabilize or.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:30]** You have to have at least half your.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:33]** You have to have at least half or else you go down and then you go down.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** But it's a minimum of one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:37]** All right.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** You have taken 10.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:38]** Yeah.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:43]** I'm going to use resolve point and refill my stamina.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:43]** Okay.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:43]** Okay.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** Because I feel like we're going to fight more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** Yeah, I mean, you guys fought Genshiroga.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** Then you did a 10-minute rest.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:52]** Then now you fought Cub, Trostanek.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** 10-minute rest.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:58]** So I don't know what your resolve points are at.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** Is that his name?

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:01]** It said Cub earlier.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:05]** They said Cub earlier when you asked who's here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:08]** Oh, I thought you were saying that it is a cub, like it's a baby.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:10]** I was like, oh, crap, these things are going to be bigger.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** That's weird.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** Why is that weird?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** That's weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:13]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:18]** So, ten minutes, and you all are back.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Stamina points?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:24]** Nico's going to say to everybody else, and he's just going to say, all right, we know they're bored now.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** We know what they want.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:33]** I say our next move is to get to the cargo bay, get to the relic, and set up a defensive position, and we'll be able to mow them down.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:40]** I've seen pirates and thieves like this when I used to do some gun running for some unsavory clients that were buying weapons from us.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:45]** You guard the horde, and you shoot them when they come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** I quite agree.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** They will be there.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** I know myself.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** So let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:53]** Didn't we hear something happening above us, I thought?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:57]** Yeah, Rick's already on his way to that secret room thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:05]** So you all heard an explosion, a small explosion above you towards what's probably the dining hall area.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:12]** And Cub was talking about, I would make you do a wisdom check, but I was going to say Cub was like, they will be here soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** Yeah.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** And then you heard it.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:24]** Let's like divvy up the arms and like secure the ship and everyone who's not an astrozoan.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:26]** Right?

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** Like shapeshifter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:30]** Okay.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** So where do you want to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:38]** He's going to follow Rick over here thinking that it's going to be a secret passageway up to the relic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** I mean, it just happened, right?

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** This literally just happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** Like, it's been a few minutes, or it's been at least a couple minutes.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:46]** It's been 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:51]** So probably with you guys talking, with you all looking through weapons.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:53]** Well, the explosion happened.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** You guys were talking.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:56]** It's been at least, I would say, 20 to 30 minutes.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:04]** So you all want to... So you guys want to... You heard that explosion, right?

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** From upstairs.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:17]** You talked to this astrozoan, killed the astrozoan, took 10 minutes of rest, and then sorted through everything.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:21]** So we're looking at like 30 minutes, 45 minutes after.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:24]** Like prepping for war.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** Prepping for war.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:28]** You got your war paint on underneath your eyeballs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:33]** It's like that scene from Mr. and Mrs. Smith where they go into that family home.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:35]** Yeah, the family home place.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:39]** Everyone's getting the knives and everything.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:41]** It's setting up the roots of ambush.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:41]** I got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** So where do you want to go?

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** What do you want to do?

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:51]** So we're going to go into that weird column thing that we found.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:52]** Okay.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** And we're going to lead the way.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:54]** Okay.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:55]** I got a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** Is everyone going there?

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** Yes.

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:58]** Okay.

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:59]** Question.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** Can Dr. Okay climb ladders?

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:02]** I think so because we've been doing this whole time.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:05]** But I literally just thought about it for the first time.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** I was like, I guess I can climb ladders.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:07]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:08]** Is that a thing?

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** Like some characters can't climb ladders?

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** I would say no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:12]** I feel like it could be.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** I mean, everybody has a climb speed, right?

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:19]** Yeah, well, you have just a move speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** Yeah, your move speed might just be lower.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:23]** But I'm going to say that you can, which is fine.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** Okay.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:29]** I definitely feel like this is a good moment where it's like you guys are just going in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** We locked the door.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** We took the access card.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:35]** We scrunched up everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** The door's locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** The heartbeat thing is not helping.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:42]** I don't like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:46]** You all start walking up the ladder, right?

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:47]** Rick at first.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:48]** Gun drawn.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** So you're going slow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:54]** You're just... Yeah, Nico's got a pistol drawn as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:59]** And so you're just awkwardly climbing, pistol in one hand, hand in the other.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:02]** Actually, it's a two-handed weapon.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:04]** I can't climb on two-handed weapons, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:04]** Yeah, I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** So I'll pull out my pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** Okay, so Rick, Nico, pistol.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Here's Dr. Okay.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:11]** You armed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:14]** I have my concealed syringe available.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:22]** As you look up, I'm going to say that maybe one of you, there's like a soft illumination from maybe one of the lights on your weapons.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:26]** Maybe there's a little tiny flashlight that you have on your weapons.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:30]** Not enough for anything significant, but just maybe because you could see.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:33]** Because as you come in, this is clearly a dark shaft.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:33]** There's no light.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:36]** But that little light beam goes pretty far.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** You can tell it goes up.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** Probably to the other side of the ship, right?

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:45]** The top of the ship is the roof there.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:48]** And as you come up, you're coming up the ladder.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:57]** You first come up what appears to be two doors, one on the right, one on the left, kind of off diagonally in front of you.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:01]** And as you shine your light up above...

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:24]** you don't see a door but maybe if you look and see it seems like the top could be something that that moves sort of a hatch or something okay what do you guys want to do where do you want to go what are you thinking you're standing on a ladder with an explosion in the dark all the way to the top of this ladder


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** And you come up to like a hatch?

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** You go all the way up to the top?

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** That's what I'm asking.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** So you're saying at the end of the ladder, there's a hatch and there's nothing in between.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** It's just a long pathway with a ladder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:37]** No, I said as you're coming up, halfway, there are two doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:42]** On probably like 45 degrees off axis from the ladder.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:46]** And then at the top, you shine your light up.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** Or if you go up there, that's fine.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** Either one.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** you kind of look around.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** Seems to be some sort of a hatch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:59]** So I guess we'll come up to that first set of pathways, and I want to roll perception down both of those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** Oh, it's not a pathway.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:00]** It's a door.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** There are two doors.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:05]** Just shut doors off-axis 45 degrees.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:08]** Shut hatch or something at the top.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** There's no light coming through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:16]** Okay, so then at the first door, can I...

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:23]** Can I roll perception to see what's on the other side of the door, like to listen through it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** You would probably only be listening.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:25]** There's no crack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** You can't see anything through it.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** Okay.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:31]** So, yeah, Rick will kind of put his hand against it.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:36]** And I rolled a 24 for perception.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:38]** 24 for perception.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** Which door?

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** I don't know.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:44]** Pick one.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:45]** You pick one.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:46]** Of the two 45s.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:47]** Left or right?

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** I'll go right.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:50]** Okay.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:52]** You don't hear anything.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:55]** You want to roll a perception on the other one, then?

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:59]** Yeah.

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** Go ahead.

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** 15 plus 5 is 20.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:01]** Okay.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:06]** Let me think.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** So I'm going to go through the right door.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:16]** You think for a second you might have heard a voice?

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** Maybe more than one voice?

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** Not quite sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:24]** Nico will go in behind him, and he'll just have one blaster raised.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** Also, he's going to do it with stealth, too.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:28]** So you want me to roll stealth?

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:30]** Are you all going through a door?

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:33]** Or are you going up?

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** I'm going right behind Rick.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** Up the ladder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** Yeah.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:38]** Currently, all of you are on the ladder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:43]** I'm going in right behind Rick off the ladder into the door.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:46]** So you're in this access way.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** Rick, Nico, what?

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** Here's Dr. Okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:51]** I guess.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:52]** We're breaching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:56]** Are we using the... Are you guys going through a door?

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** Are you going to the top?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:01]** Are you going through the left door, right door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** Are you going back down?

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** Are you going to go back the normal way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:10]** No, so Rick's going to go through, out of the two doors, one of them he hears voices, the other one he doesn't.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:12]** He's going to go through the door that he doesn't hear anything.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:13]** Okay.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:17]** And he's going to try to, he doesn't have very good stealth, but he's going to try to stealthily open that door.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:19]** I will follow behind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** It's just going to open anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** Is it an electric door?

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** Is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:25]** Uh, is it an electric door?

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:32]** Uh, it is a door that has a, like... Automated component.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** Okay, fine.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** Whatever.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** I rolled a 12 for stealth anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:36]** You rolled a stealth.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** A 12 for stealth.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** A stealth for 12.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:41]** All right.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** The door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** To the non-voice door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:46]** The non-voice door.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** The door to the right.

**[00:57:50 - 00:58:09]** I can imagine this is a little climactic in the sense that you've uncovered a dead captain, a passenger who is not who he said he was, a secret compartment, a secret access to the secret compartment.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:20]** And although maybe you didn't talk to everyone, there's a lot going on here and a lot of secrets and a lot of clues.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:27]** And you're about to open the door, one of the doors, out of the secret access compartment.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** So you push the numpad.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** Slides open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:38]** I'm not the only one that hears the heartbeat noise, right?

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** Okay.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** I thought I was losing my mind.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** It's making me nervous.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** That's game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** No!

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Dang it, Kevin.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:58]** Look what you did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** Just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:03]** I hate you, John.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:07]** Hey, everyone.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** It's Kevin.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:20]** I play the android Rick19, and I just want to take this opportunity to discuss a very important topic to me about how Rick19 is not a murder bot.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:23]** I mean, let's just analyze the situation, right?

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:25]** Like, we caught that goblin.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:32]** They were on the ground, and they had surrendered, and they were even giving us information.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:37]** And Nico says, oh, it's just a liability, and shoots him.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:40]** And then today, we caught that Astrozoan.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:47]** We put him in a crate, which is the only reasonable way to contain a shape-shifting, compressible being.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:49]** And Rick wanted to take him to the authorities.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:55]** But Nico and Hears decide to play rock, paper, scissors to decide who gets to kill it.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:58]** And then Hears is the one to stab it through the head, or...

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:22]** face or i don't however astrozoan biology works i don't know anyways rick has never killed anybody except out of necessity and self-defense except for that vest on the roof like but but that's a different situation right there was that flashback and the visions and it was an accident it's not like rick intentionally killed that vest he wanted to take them into the android abolitionist front

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:28]** So I'm sure we'll learn more about that later because Rick wants to learn what happened there too.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** So join us along.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:35]** Please let us know on Twitter, Instagram, what you think.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:40]** If you think Rick is not a murder bot, please tell us.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:43]** And if you disagree with that statement, then keep it to yourself.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:48]** But otherwise, we just want to say thank you to Paizo and Hero Lab, Roll20, Sirenscape.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:50]** And especially, we just want to thank you as a listener.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:52]** Thank you for subscribing.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** Thank you for tuning in every week.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:57]** Or even if you're just trying to catch up on older episodes, which is also a great way to do it.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:59]** I binge listen to everything in two.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:01]** But we just really appreciate you listening.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:03]** And we want to hear more from you.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:07]** So hit us up on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, wherever you want.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:07]** Tell us what you think.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:09]** Tell us what you like, what you don't like.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:19]** I guess one last thing is if you're at all interested, we all just bought our badges to go to Gen Con 21 in Indianapolis in September.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:24]** So if you're planning on going to that, let us know and maybe we'll meet up.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:25]** It'd be great.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:29]** Other than that, again, thank you for listening.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:33]** And we hope you listen in next week for the next We'll Save Wednesday.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:35]** Kevin.
