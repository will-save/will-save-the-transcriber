## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:06]** Last time on We'll Save... The battle with Gingeroga continues!

**[00:00:07 - 00:00:14]** With one swift charge, Gingeroga is able to prove her lethality by taking down Nico Orion!

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:27]** However, thanks to the supercharged teamwork of Rick19 and Hears, the tables are quickly turned on the bar guest, as the pair blast Gingeroga before it could devour the unconscious Nico!

**[00:00:27 - 00:00:30]** After finishing off Gingeroga, Dr. O.K.

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:32]** quickly stabilizes Nico and the captain.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:42]** Our adventures start taking stock of the aftermath, and when the group asks first mate Lozu about Algiata's condemning ledger, she breaks down in tears.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:44]** What's wrong, Lozu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:48]** Find out this time on We'll See.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:48]** what an episode last week i don't even remember what happened

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** Wow.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** It's funny.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:56]** It's almost like you set that up and then, you know, like the set serve and then spike because I'm going to give you all a little recap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:58]** It's not like I took extensive notes or anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:58]** Yeah.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:01]** Well, we pulled you out of a bar.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:04]** You weren't really responding really well, so we rushed you to the hospital.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:06]** It was full.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** It was full.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:08]** Yeah.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:08]** Yeah.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** There was a lot going on.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:13]** Look, I'm going to jump right into it because I want to start at the beginning.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** But it's John's birthday next week.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:15]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** Happy birthday, John.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** Thank you.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** Cheers.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** So we should say something before that.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** On the 28th, it is technically the day I was born.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:23]** I think we should sing happy birthday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** It's two days from now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Two days.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** We can't legally sing it.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** Can we sing it?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** We can do our own version.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** It's common license.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:33]** You can totally do it.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:33]** It is now.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** I think it was.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** Nick, can you just sing it in minor, in a minor key?

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** No, I can't because I'm not that good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** Well, that was my only birthday wish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** Happy birthday to you, John.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** To you, John.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** Happy birthday to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:57]** Happy birthday to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** I really appreciate that.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** Thanks, y'all.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** That was good stuff.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** Really, really, really appreciate that.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** That was nice.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** That was so enthusiastic.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** I'm sure this will all be cut.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:10]** No, I'm going to keep it in there.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:13]** I keep so much of this in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:14]** So much.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** So much.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** So much comedy gold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:20]** As you walk on by.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** Will you call my name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:29]** I was just going to be silent and see how long Nick would go before we would jump back into it.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** He won't stop.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** He won't stop.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:31]** He'll never stop.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:38]** Look, after squashing a small struggle with a potential traveler.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** at Legacy Station.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:44]** You all board the Chimera as passengers.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:56]** Not long after, the ship's engine malfunctions and you're stranded in the Drift, a different plane that allows you to travel quickly throughout the galaxy.

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:05]** Then, the security officer, Algiada Eom, is nowhere to be found, and another passenger, a professor, asks you to investigate.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:09]** Strange events begin to occur throughout the ship.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:19]** You find a Vesk, another passenger, unconscious, but suspect something doesn't add up, so after taking out their security robot, you...

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:25]** allow them, or rather, give them no choice but to be withheld in their cabin.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:32]** You find a crew member frozen, unmoving in the hallway, only to be totally fine when confronted.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:37]** The room of the missing security officer is trapped.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:41]** You all disable that, but not without some injury.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:53]** But then upon further exploration, it really just ultimately leads to more questions as you find evidence and a scheme involving the professor, the first mate, and then the captain.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:56]** All these clues coming in.

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:01]** Then goblins start trashing the ship in search of something.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:07]** And the leader of the goblins, a hobgoblin named Jintiroga,

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:11]** is no goblin at all, but a canine... Ginger-o-girl.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** Ginger-o-girl.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** Oh, I didn't get that drop.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:16]** I'll put it in later, so it's cool.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:22]** But a canine shapeshifter called a Barkist.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** If you don't learn that in minor by next episode...

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** You're off the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:31]** Did you say a canine shapeshifter called a bark cast?

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** Oh, that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:34]** No, a bar cast.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:36]** Punishment.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** Punishment.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:37]** Is that punishment?

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** I feel like that's just not quite good enough.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** I still have one from last time, so it doesn't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]** I have one saved up, but I fear I can't use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** I always just forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** Didn't Nico use a punishment?

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** No, I didn't.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** I haven't used mine either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** Because I never got one.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:53]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** No, I did.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:55]** He did.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** I got one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:57]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** It won't be hard for Nick to get punishments.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** I do not have any.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:00]** Ooh.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:04]** I'm not good at puns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** You missed 100% of the shots you don't take there, Kelly.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** It's true.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** All right, get prepared.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** Get prepared.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:10]** Oh, I'm prepared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** I sent you one last week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** I mean, I saw that way too late.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** You only get one shot.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** Do not let your chance to go.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** It's opportunity, folks.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Once in a lifetime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:22]** I don't think Eminem said folks, but I liked the change.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:22]** It was good.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** Folks, yes.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** Folks.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:29]** Look, so Jinchuranga tries to take the bridge and the ship, but ultimately you all foil him.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:34]** her plans, and along with a little help from the crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:38]** Foil is first, inner, outer, and last when you're multiplying polynomials.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** Yes, indeed.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:43]** That is how we spent the episode, was foiling a lot of polynomials.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:50]** Along the way, besides extra polynomials, you find and had some other clues, such as

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:53]** overhearing a conversation between Alciata.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** It's first outer, inside, last.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** I said it backwards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Are you trying to do the foil?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** That's a joke, man!

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** We foiled her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** Oh, man.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:09]** I'm going to leave it in there so that way everyone can hear your joke.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:17]** You found something that you haven't looked at yet, which is a gift wrap package from the Vesk Trosten X room.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:28]** You found in Algiata's room a paper account ledger with some bank transfers that also had a clue for LP ship repairs.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:36]** And then among some other things, a photograph, the Star Dream 2 panel.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:45]** I really want to come back to that paper account ledger because it is that that you left off last week.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:51]** Talking with Lozu after you first outer interlasted Jinchuroga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** Yes, thank you, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:57]** Does it actually... Yeah, I mean...

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:04]** If you think about the combat itself, it was... Yeah, it works, right?

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:04]** First inside.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** First outer and our last.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Yeah.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:12]** So... Let me bring you guys over to the map here.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** We're on the big map today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** Oh, dang, we're going back to the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** We're on the big boy map?

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** You're on the big boy map today.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** It's episode 18.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** A lot of things are bumping up, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:29]** I forgot that there's actually a map that I should have in front of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** Yeah, there is also.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** Oh, you're saying you didn't log into Roll20?

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** Thank you, Roll20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:43]** Thank you, Roll20, for having such a seamless interface for me to log into on the fly and not disrupt this podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:43]** Yeah, weird.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:48]** I also don't see Nico or Ryan in this Roll20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** He's probably under somebody else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** There he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** Nico's there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:56]** So you all were talking to Lozu.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** It was a temporary glitch.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:06]** And Lozu, you asked Lozu about the LP ship repairs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:09]** I have a little bone to pick with you, John, on this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** Whoa, whoa, whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:18]** Because Rick rolled like a super high sense motive and I didn't get anything from her.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:25]** I feel like if she's trying to hide something, we would have gotten at least like an eye twitch or like he would have sensed like a raised heartbeat.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:29]** I mean, I rolled like a natural 20 on that sense motive.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:29]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Which sense motive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:44]** When we first started talking to Lozu last, like after the captain had left, and then Lozu starts talking, Rick rolled like a natural 20 on his sense motive.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:46]** And you're just like, he only gets one shot.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:46]** You don't sense anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** One opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** Just saying.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** Yeah, folks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** Kevin, welcome to my life.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:55]** Great job, Will.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:58]** I'm just saying, welcome to my life on the computer's checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** You know what?

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:11]** There is something to be said for the fact that if I didn't reveal anything, maybe it's because the circumstances under which you asked, that sense motive, that perception, there wasn't anything to reveal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** Plot armor.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:15]** Oh!

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Calling you out!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:20]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:26]** For the fans that don't know, plot armor is when the GM fudges rolls in order to protect the plot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:29]** I'm going to come down really hard on this and squash it where it is.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** I don't fudge rules.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** I've never done that.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** I really don't because it's not fun.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** The whole thing is about the dice.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** It's funny.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:47]** If you think it's plot armor, that might mean that you think that there's something I'm trying to jump or hide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** When there's really nothing there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:59]** When either there's nothing there or I'm on your side in the sense that I'm never going to only leave it to be like if you –

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:02]** Don't ask this one super specific question.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:04]** You won't find out the clue there.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:07]** Like I'm on your side of trying to make it all accessible.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:09]** I'm not trying to withhold things from you.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:16]** But at the same time, it is a game, and there are things that sometimes you have to ask or come to a certain place before you find out.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:19]** So what I'll say is this.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:23]** Don't take your frustration that maybe –

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:27]** things didn't come out like you thought and then blame it on me.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:31]** Instead, just put it into the story of your character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** You own it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** I mean, translation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Never let it go.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** Yeah.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** You only get one shot.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:43]** Don't miss your chance to blow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** Here's my translation of that.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:49]** I will neither confirm nor deny the existence of plot armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:51 - 00:12:03]** Look, I absolutely am telling you that there is a reason for everything that you guys have seen, heard, saw, or do whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:08]** He's trying not to point fingers, but it's actually Paizo wrote the plot armor into the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:11]** That's true.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** Again.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** Again.


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:14]** Again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Why don't we do this?

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:21]** Why don't we get through book one and then we'll talk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** How's that sound?

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** We'll talk about book one after book one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:25]** How's that sound?

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** How about you ask me about plot armor then?

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** How about you ask me about plot armor then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** Hold on.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** I put it in the notes somewhere.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** Ask John about plot armor.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** That's fine.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:40]** Look, I think it's a great idea, though, because I'm always so curious about, like, how this stuff works.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:47]** So I think after we finish the first book, we should do, like, a full episode of, you know, behind the scenes and break it down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** I'm not opposed to that.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:48]** I would love that.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** But like I said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** Oh, that would be such a cool episode.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:57]** I am willing to talk about it to a certain degree, as much as I can without...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:00]** Yeah, he doesn't want to ruin future things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** I can answer as many things as I can.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:08]** Look, all I'm saying, I think I told one of you this, and this is something good for the listeners too.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** Let's say we're in book five, book six.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:19]** There will be things that when you listen back to episode one, you'll be like, oh, that makes sense.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:27]** Things as they are are set up, and it will all make sense at some point.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** So with that.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:31]** I'm giving you a hard time, John.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** I really am.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:37]** And I'm responding because I think it's a little fun to argue.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** And then the listeners get to hear a little more.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:40]** So it's good.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:45]** Hey, I have my own question armor where I can take these shots.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** I can take these shots across the bow here.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** Did you pick your bone, Kev?

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Do you feel like it's been picked?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** I think that was my bone.

**[00:13:54 - 00:14:00]** I just felt personally... Because then we had the whole LP thing.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:08]** I couldn't... I'm too stupid, personally, to make a connection between LP and... I'm pretty sure that we talked about that when you found it.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:10]** I'm pretty sure we talked about that when you found it.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** I can't even remember her name right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:14]** I really like long play records, actually.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:16]** Good.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** Nice, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** They're amazing.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** You're in luck, so it's good.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:27]** Look, you all asked her about this LP for She Prepares, and she started to sob.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:33]** And then she quickly stiffens up.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** I won't sense motive on this.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:38]** It's funny that she hasn't said anything, and you guys are sensing motive.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:42]** So, because she hasn't said a damn thing... Well, okay, is that more perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:45]** Are these tears of anger?

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:45]** Tears of sadness?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** Then I am going to...

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:48]** I would just say perception.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:52]** Because since motive is like, she's got to say stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** I'm going to wait for her to say something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:58]** And I'm going to use your perception check throughout us talking now.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** Can I roll my perception again then?

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** No.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:05]** I can roll an 8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** That's a 19 for me.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:10]** I was going to wait until she actually said something.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:15]** Both of you can tell that she seems genuinely surprised.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:27]** saddened and a little bit probably taken off guard because she was just in a situation in which she thought that her life was over and then you all came in and helped to save the day and she's a little her nerves are a little frayed naturally it's all right

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** Hmm.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** Can she talk?

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** Is she going to talk?

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:36]** She should.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:41]** She sobs for just a few seconds and then stiffens up quickly.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:48]** I've got a bit of a...

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:50]** of a gambling thing.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** Okay.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:58]** I, I, I spent some, some funds that were meant for, for ship repair, um, a few stops ago.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:02]** And, and look, I, I, I started paying Algiata back already.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** Um, Keeve, they've been so helpful.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** They've, they've helped me to make it better.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:09]** You know, I'm, I'm, I'm learning to manage it.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:12]** Uh, they've been talking to me to help me manage it.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:18]** And, uh, yeah, that's, that's why you, you see that in, in her check accounting book there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:42]** nico's gonna respond to that saying i hear there's a meeting room actually for this kind of thing like two floors down i'm i don't quite follow gamblers anonymous come on i can't be the only ce former ceo around here who's had a gambling problem i well i i'm not a former ceo you are the first


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:54]** Look, it's good to know that I guess people in power, well, who used to be in power, they also have this issue.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** Now can I roll a sense motive?

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** Now you can roll a sense motive if you would like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:03]** Ten plus... Hold on.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** Plus...

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** Minus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** Fourteen.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:09]** Fourteen.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** Okay.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:15]** She seems like she... How do I say this?

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:23]** She seems like she's genuinely opening up about it because it's something that she has come to terms with and she's trying to get over it.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:27]** It does seem like she's very...

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** She's very open about it.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:34]** And you wonder why she's so open about it.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:41]** But nothing throws you a red flag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:46]** What do you all want to do?

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:50]** Nico's going to kind of look over to...

**[00:17:52 - 00:18:15]** rick next to him and he's just gonna kind of kind of tap the side of his android arm a little bit and he's just gonna kind of nudge his head back the other way kind of subtly if you want me to do a sleight of hand check i'm willing to do it if you don't want lozu to see what you just did then roll a like a sleight of hand check that's fine that's a 21


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** Okay.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:16]** Yeah.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:20]** She, she, at that time is kind of just rubbing her head.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:22]** So she's not even looking in your direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** So Rick, Rick will look over at Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:36]** No, he's trying to get your, Nico's going to look, Nico's going to look back at him and he's going to do it again, trying to get everybody to start walking back.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:40]** And he's, he's going to look back at Lowe's and he's going to say, I'm sure you got a lot to do.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** Thank you for your time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:44]** Yeah, I need to clean up.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** I need some rest.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:50]** I suggest that you all get some rest, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:57]** is going to tell Lizu that admitting that she has a problem is the first step in recovery.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:57]** Thank you.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:05]** And that she can come to believe that a higher power has called her to restore normalcy in her life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** Thank you, Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:12]** I suggest that we adjourn to some rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:15]** Yeah, I agree.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:18]** And then at that point, the doors open.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:26]** Grath walks back in, starts to walk over and says, I see you guys are still here.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Is everything okay?

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:29]** Ozu, are you okay?

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:31]** She's kind of wiping her eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:35]** Nico's going to talk to Grath for a second.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:39]** He's going to be like, she's fine, old buddy.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** She just needs a moment to collect herself.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** She'll be right as rain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:43]** All right.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:44]** All right.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:47]** Well, yeah, I'm going to help her clean up here.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:50]** Thank you again, you all.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:53]** You deserve some rest.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:56]** And then he's going to walk over to one of the stations.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** What are you all going to do?

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** Where did Rameem go?

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** Rameem went back to his room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:09]** Yeah, that's where Graf escorted him to.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** I'm assuming we're walking out.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Is that correct, everyone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:16]** Yeah, Rick will turn to them and say, thank you for your time.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** Thanks.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:20]** And then you all walk out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** The body of Jinjiroga is still there.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** Presumably they're going to do something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** I'm going to search his body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** Ah, okay.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:29]** Going to search the body.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** You did not.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:31]** Nope.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:38]** Because then, well, you would have found a couple things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:42]** I got a 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:48]** 27 on the search?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:50]** But I don't know what I need to roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:50]** It's fine.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:51]** I'll say this.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:57]** This is what you find on Gingeroga's body.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:15]** As you turn over the largely muscled canine creature, you see that those armor that was this like holographic blue grid is, you know it to be basic Lashunta temp weave armor.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** So you can take that.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:21]** She has azimuth laser pistol with two batteries.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** Each battery has 20 charges.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** I'll take that.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:33]** And she also has what's called an engineer's puzzle box that has goblin writing on it, likely belonged to one of the goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** I'll take that, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:38]** Okay, so you take all of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** You take all of it?

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:42]** Hold on, I haven't even gotten a chance to look at what Lashunta armor does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** Basic Lashunta tamp weave.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:49]** Yes, it's useless for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:51 - 00:22:01]** So all armor can be turned into armor that fits somebody after an engineering check or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** Really?

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** Yeah.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:09]** Yeah, well, I mean, I'll roll off for it, but it's mine because I thought of looking for it.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** And you said we already looked for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:12]** Does anyone want to roll off for it?

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** Are we rolling off here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** I'll roll off just to roll off at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** I'll roll off too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:20]** I mean, hell, I'll roll off to see if I get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** You got a fucking natural 20?

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** That's it.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:23]** That's it.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** It's going to Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:29]** So who wants to explain what a... I'm going to inject Kev.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:32]** Who wants to explain what a roll off is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** Nose goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** I'm taking the pistols and the armor.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:37]** Nose goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:42]** Nick, explain what a roll-off is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** A roll-off is when two people want the same thing.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:51]** And because they want the same thing, it's basically I want it more or I want it more.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:51]** Well...

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:55]** No one can really tell who wants it more, but a roll can.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** So what do you roll?

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:00]** We roll a 20-sided dice to see who wants it more.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** Best roll wins.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** Best roll wins the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** And if you didn't win, you didn't want it hard enough.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:07]** You didn't want it hard enough.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** Yep, luck has nothing to do with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:12]** So it looks like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:17]** The first person who can flip to the armor page wins.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** That's not how it works.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** That's not how a roll-off works.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:25]** So I do want to remind you all that it's probably at this point.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:27]** The emergency lights are still on.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:33]** At this point, it's probably mid to late afternoon on the second day.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:37]** And I'm trying to think of anything that you guys might have there.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:41]** There's the map that you grabbed from the Hobgoblins.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:47]** The power is off except the emergency power is going.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:49]** But you all are essentially stranded in the drift.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** Here's what did you say?

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:50]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:56]** Here's has that map open right now and it's kind of like fingering the map.

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:21]** uh so anyway there's three floors represented on this map and uh they're too long there yeah yeah i know i realized in real time it was pretty bad all right so there's like these like red circles um and on these three floors for like a total of one two three four five six seven places where something may be hidden one of these was where the goblins was and he kind of identifies that so he says to the group like hey guys

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:26]** I think we should take this time to check all these places out, find out what those guys were looking for.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:29]** And he kind of shows the map to the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:33]** Nico takes strong interest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** Takes strong what?

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** Interest, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** Interest.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:36]** Interest.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:38]** Interest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:41]** So we kind of show it to the rest of the crew.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:50]** So this ladder in the top right of this deck has something circled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:58]** So after looking at that map, just for the listeners, it looks like a rough drawing of the ship.

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:59]** There's three different levels.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:07]** And then there are red circles around different areas, one of which is the corner of the corridor that we're looking at now.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:15]** What Rick thinks is going on is that these are either places to look or places that they've already looked.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:18]** But it correlates.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:22]** One is Algiada's room, which is where we were attacked.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:26]** And the other looks like the hallway where we fought the goblins.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:33]** So I'm assuming it's where we already searched or where we're going to search map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:39]** Yeah, and they were searching at Algiata's room when we encountered them, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:46]** Algiata's room is where the trap was set.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** So they probably already searched that.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:59]** Where they were was down in the deck below near the galley and the crew's mess in the hallway there.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:01]** And they were pulling everything off the walls and

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:26]** that's where if you look at the map at the the top part um it shows the the area on the left side and then there's two other circles that are i believe are the circles are the pools in the gym one on each side which they were in the gym area uh dr okay found well i stand corrected let's uh why don't we take a look why don't we take a look over here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:27]** Dr.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** O.K., Nico, what are you guys thinking?

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** You going to go look over there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** Yeah, Nico's going to go look over there with yours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:35]** Okay.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** Yours is going to look over there.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** You all walk down.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:48]** So you start walking east in the upper deck towards a large quarter spherical sheep.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** That's probably the bulkhead.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:50]** That's a 21.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:51]** From the ship.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** 21.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** That's a 6.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** What'd you get here?

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:54]** That's a 6.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** Let's rely on Nico.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:04]** Kiers, you're probably looking at where the seams are, and Nico knows that there's nothing to be found necessarily at the seams of this.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:06]** They seem to be welded there.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** It's probably difficult for anything to be there.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** But Nico, you start rubbing your hands along the surface.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:14]** It doesn't feel like anything special.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:15]** It just seems normal.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:19]** You don't find anything of note.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:22]** All right, Nico's just going to call out to the rest of the group.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:22]** He's going to be like,

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:26]** Oh, so far it looks like it done.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:28]** Here's any other ideas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** So we didn't find anything, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** There's nothing to be found.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Let's keep looking.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:38]** And then here's kind of like pokes his head up, up the ladder, up to that floor again.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** It says, we're going to go check us out.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** You guys want to join?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** Where are you going to check out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** We're going to go check out more spots.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:46]** I think.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:48]** Okay.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:48]** Yep.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** If I will follow.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:52]** Okay.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:54]** So you all start going to investigate.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:55]** I'll follow.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** Okay.

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:00]** And you are heading down to the lower deck?

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** Yes.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:01]** We're going to engineering.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:02]** Okay.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:04]** You're going to the middle deck or you're going to the lower deck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:08]** Where is the bottom right of that map is?

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:09]** Where exactly?

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** One up or one down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:19]** You presume probably Dr. OK and Rick, since you've been down to the lower deck, you kind of recognize that as part of the outline of the lower deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:28]** The bottom left one is the upper deck because the bridge is that little square on top that's circled on the other one.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:34]** And then the middle deck is you see the pool areas where those two circles are.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:40]** The side is where the goblins were, and then you go down another level, and that's where the other two spots are.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:44]** So do we want to make another scoop around Algiada's room?

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:49]** Do we want to reinvestigate Algiada's room now that we know they were searching for something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** Good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:52]** Okay.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:52]** Let's do it.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:53]** All right.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:54]** Let's do it.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:57]** So you go back into Algiana's room.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Door opens.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:01]** Another bolt shoots at us.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Yep.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** Nico gets hit again.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** You all die instantly.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** You all die instantly.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** It's tough.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** Instantaneous frozen.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** And you're instantly frozen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:10]** Let it go.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** Let it go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:17]** You walk in and the room appears to be untouched from when you were in there.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:20]** Nothing's really changed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:23]** Do you guys want it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:23]** Yeah.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** I got a 19.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** A 19.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** Anybody else?

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:28]** Dirty 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:31]** Let's see here.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:35]** That's a... It's going to be a 22 for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** Just a 22.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** Look at a big old fat 11.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** Big old fat 11.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:48]** Nico, as you're looking... With the 22... From the hallway...

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** Yeah, Nico, are you coming in the room?

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Yep, I come in the room, so sorry.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:53]** Logistical issues.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:59]** You come in, and maybe you sit down on the bed, and you...

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:11]** You kind of feel the bed and then you're just looking down and you just notice that the ground, like the carpet or the material right near the bed seems like it's just been like shifted in a weird way.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:16]** It's kind of like one of those, you know, like the pillows that you can rub and then it's, you know, and you don't remember being over here.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** So what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** I want to roll a perception check.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:25]** See if I notice or sense anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:27]** Well, but you did just notice that.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** So what do you want to do now that you've noticed that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** Flip a pillow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** Flip a pillow from the, like, looking.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** Yeah.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** Do you tell everyone else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:41]** Yeah, I'm going to say to everybody else, you know, something doesn't feel right about this bed here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:49]** Rick is going to lift his rifle up and aim it at the bed as if he's afraid something's going to jump out at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:49]** Okay.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:52]** Nico's going to start kind of going through the pillows.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:56]** By the way, John, are the pillows stitched together?

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:59]** Or do they have, like, a pillowcase over it that you can hide something in?

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** Or...

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:05]** Does there look to be anything unusual about the stitching of the pillows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** They're virtual pillows, actually.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** They're holographic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:13]** There doesn't seem to be anything crazy about that.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Thanks for laughing, Kelly.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:18]** Whoever's looking, give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** Another perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** Eight.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** That's eleven.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:27]** 8 and 11.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** 12.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Dr. O'Kay?

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:30]** 24.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:32]** 24.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** Okay.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:53]** Dr. O'Kay, you notice that there's something in kind of the back part of the bed that looks to be like some sort of a grate.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:56]** Like a ventilation grate.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:59]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** Look over there.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:04]** There's some grate here by this bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** How big is it?

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** Can we slip through it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:10]** Nico's going to ask Dr. Okay.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** Is it loose?

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** Can I find out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** Yeah, give me another perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** Whoever's going to look.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** Well, I've pointed it out so everyone can look at it.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:20]** That's true.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:23]** I rolled a natural one on whether or not it's loose.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:27]** I'll see if I can try.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:27]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:31]** Do you want us to do a strength check on that, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:35]** No, because unless you're trying to rip up the grade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:35]** All right.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:37]** Well, that's going to be what?

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:39]** That's a 16 for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:39]** 16.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:40]** Rick, you said what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:43]** He just reaches down and sees if he can lift it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:44 - 00:33:10]** okay um so you do reach down here's what you get a 16 16 so rick you reach down and you notice that the vent is already kind of partially loose uh here's moose to open it it's about like a foot wide and about you know six inches like so rick pulls on it and like part of it opens

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:13]** Yeah, it doesn't seem like it was totally secure.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** It seems like it was partially loose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** There's still a bolt connected?

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** Can he undo something to open it fully?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** You could probably pull it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:28]** Okay, yeah, I'll do whatever it takes to... I'm going to say you're able to kind of just start to pull it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:33]** As that happens, Nico's going to pull his pistol out, just in case something comes flying out of that thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:34]** Okay.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:35]** You...

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:47]** kind of pull it out, and you notice at the bottom that there's this weird, like, residue.

**[00:33:49 - 00:34:00]** Kind of as you're, like, reaching under, you kind of pull off the grate and then look down, and you see this weird, odd residue that's at, like, the bottom of the vent right before it kind of goes into the duct.


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:29]** uh like to investigate the residue um what should i roll for that how do you want to investigate rick will actually look at dr okay and say do you happen to know what this residue is because he's like the yeah can i do like a life science check yeah you can do life science check no judgments on the other two but you know he's the most educated in the room sure well i mean also this yeah

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:35]** Although my life science is plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:38]** Nico's going to look over at Rick while Dr. Okay does this.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:42]** And he's just going to go start on this kind of tangent here a little bit.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:47]** He's like, I remember seeing this old cartoon pre-drift.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** No, pre-gap.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** There was a character.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:53]** I think I want to say his name was Ezra.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:55]** It seemed like a kid show at the time.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:57]** He was always going into vents.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:02]** Always going into vents and ducts.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** I can't help but think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** I have no idea what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** That's what we need to do.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:05]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:06]** I do.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** And maybe life science check.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:13]** I hope that's sorry.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:13]** Yeah.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:16]** I just, it was an interesting reference and one that I got finally.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:18]** So I was really excited to respond.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:22]** And I just wanted to say, I hope there's like fruit, fruit tarts or pastries on the other end.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** That's what I'd like to see.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:26]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** That's all.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:27]** Okay.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** You reach down.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:31]** Maybe Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:34]** You, uh, pull out the custom micro lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** Right, right, right.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:39]** You kind of put it in there.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:45]** The residue seems to be the dried remains, some natural slippery substance.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:49]** Think something similar to like what Osharus have, but not quite.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:56]** Maybe more like a mucus, something that's produced by an ooze or something similar.

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:04]** And in fact, because you rolled so well, you kind of think about it and you're like, well, I...

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:09]** am somebody who produces this natural substance.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:11]** What are other creatures?

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:22]** And then you're like, maybe, maybe some creatures that would have an amorphous body, like a creature that has the compression ability.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:33]** When you think about that and you're looking at the size of the vent, how the vent's only maybe a foot wide, there's no way anybody of a medium size could really get down there at all.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** Maybe a small size.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** Maybe.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** Depending on if they're even smaller.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:41]** But it's likely some sort of creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Would that have been one of the space lights?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** Asteroid lights?

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:49]** There is some creature who can fit in this grate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:53]** Was it the little lice?

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Space lice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** Do they secrete that kind of stuff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:02]** You would need to do another life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:05]** Here's rolled a 27 to find that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:08]** I rolled a 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:16]** Asteroid lice do not have the compression ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:19]** Do I know of common...

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:24]** Creatures that fit that description.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** It could be some creatures.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** You're not quite sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:32]** Something that has a compression ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:34]** You can't quite tell from just this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:42]** Perhaps something not a spice slice, but something similar.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** I don't know.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:45]** I'm not a doctor after all.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** Wait, I am a doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:51]** Doctor in your head.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** I was about to say there, Doctor O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** I thought you were a doctor.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** I was trying to attempt a humorous joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:03]** All right, well, I'll have to address myself to a shot of humor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:07]** Yes, it's very dry, despite how wet we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Oh, come on, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:16]** That's really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** Well done.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** Nicely done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** That's very good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** How big are goblins?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:22]** Again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** How big are space goblins?

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:25]** Space goblins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** They're small.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** Can they compress themselves?

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** He's saying they have to be compressible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:37]** Yeah, space goblins are small, but it's a creature that has some sort of amorphous body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:40]** It's probably something we don't know anything about.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** It's probably Kiev, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** So that's a good segue.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** What do you guys want to do with this clue?

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** You know, you have this clue now, right?

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:52]** There's the picture of Professor Bernard Benjamin.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:56]** You have not gone to talk to Keefe or help out with the engine at all.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:56]** Shit!

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:59]** We've also got these other locations on the map.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** What if it's Algiata?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** We should check out more of the map.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:02]** I'm with Kevin here.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** Or with Rick.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:11]** What if Algiata set the trap and escaped through this ventilation hole?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** Because she is running from the goblins.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** It makes the most sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:18]** Why is she running from the goblins?

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:21]** Didn't we believe at first that she set this up?

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** I'm not certain of any of these clues right now.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** Nothing's fitting together.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:29]** I think in the meantime, we should keep checking out these spots, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** We're real close to the rest of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:36]** Should we booby trap this vent for later today?

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** We're bruising.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** I agree with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** Can you put your motion sensor in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:42]** Yeah, why not?

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** Yeah, Nico, you got anything you can use?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** I don't have anything to use, but I agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:49]** We jacked the motion sensor from the hallway, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Yeah, it's right on the door.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** It's this room that we used it on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** So we'll just set it up to look at the bed.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** You're going to set it up underneath the bed?

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** Underneath the bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** Here's, we'll grab it and do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** We'll have 15 computers.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** I'm going to say that.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:03]** Here's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:06]** No, I'm just, here's is good at that, so he's going to try it.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** What were you going to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:10]** You can't take 20 on computer checks.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:14]** I don't know if you can take 20 on engineering checks, but I would say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:19]** Well, here's got a 27 on the damn computers check.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** So hopefully you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:20]** That's fine.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** Yeah.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:26]** So maybe here's you were able to help set up to make sure because 27 is pretty high.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:30]** I'm going to say that that allows you to doctor.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** Okay.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:33]** You don't need to be like close by.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:34]** Right.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:42]** It just means that that probably anywhere within the ship, except for maybe some places that are very far away from this location.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:46]** For the most part, you'll be able to get a notification if it goes off.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:55]** And then I would say give me an engineering check just to set it up real quick how you want it.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** Fucking 20.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:58]** 20, yeah.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:58]** You're able to set it up.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** It syncs well.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:03]** The Bluetooth pairs really well with your iPad, and you're good to go.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:23]** uh john would there be any way i could boost the signal on that so no matter where we were on the ship um if you would like to do a computer check yeah that's fine but to get it to be perfect that's fine but what i'm telling you is that you're at like 95 do it anyway seriously do do it anyway


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** That's going to be a 28 job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:31]** Set up like signal repeater and let's get on our way.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** Yeah.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:35]** You set up a little signal booster in the room and you're good to go.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:39]** That's, by the way, we were wondering about my other secret.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:41]** That's my second secret, guys.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:44]** Plus 10 on the computer's checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:46]** Oh, you're higher than me now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:48]** Damn it.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:50]** How many ranks do you have in computers?

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:50]** Very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:53]** I have two ranks in computers.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:56]** I just took the hacker specialization.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:57]** There it is.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** That's what I was hoping you would talk about.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:00]** Good.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** Cool.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:04]** Okay, so that's pretty great.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** It's a pretty straightforward setup.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** So what do you guys want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:13]** Are all of you at full health?

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** I'm at full health.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:17]** I have less biohacks, but...

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:23]** Okay, here's... I'm just missing one resolve point for some reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:25]** I'm pretty banged up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:28]** I think, here's, you're missing the resolve point from being squeezed by the Hugbot.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** Yes, correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:36]** While we're in this room, Rick will actually say, like, does anybody have any carrying room?

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:39]** It turns out all these guns are quite heavy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** I'll definitely take one.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:46]** I'll take that armor off your hands, by the way, since I'm proficient in it and not in yours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:48 - 00:43:12]** that's that's fair i will keep the heavy armor and i'll hand you the try weave temp weave yeah temp weave the initiative wave um and then so is anybody else qualified in small arms long arms or heavy weapons i'm qualified in long i guess i'll take the laser pistols just for good measure


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:19]** But if you want, I could use the extra magazines for the laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** I can give you an extra magazine.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** I don't think I'm qualified in any of that, actually.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** So there you go.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:24]** Go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:50]** you're it'll show you on roll 20 on the hero lab on the left side it shows your proficiencies small arms I would like a gun please because I'll give here's my pistol as backup but the ice carbine if you are long arms then you should take the ice carbine and this is I'm talking your Rick's voice I just don't feel like doing the robot for this whole discussion

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:55]** I'll keep my artillery laser rifle.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** I can't do large arms.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** That's what you're talking about.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** That's a heavy arm, so I'll keep the heavy.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:05]** So, Nico, I'll give you the ice carbine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:10]** Nico's gonna say, I guess it's only fitting that I end up with this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** That's very true.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Very fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** Alright, now I'll let it go, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** No, that was appropriate.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** I was getting...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:26]** Nico, you almost died twice.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:30]** So, you know, you're still up and going.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:34]** So, you know, you definitely got some mileage on you today.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:36]** So it's been a long day.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:37]** It's been a long day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:42]** And in that time, I'm going to just use this time to reload my artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:50]** Nico is also going to suggest that the one thing that is the big unknown in this situation...

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** is the treasure.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:59]** We've had a group of goblins on the ship try to seize control of the ship for a purpose we do not yet know.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:12]** We have a forged ledger document, gambling problems, and very valuable cargo here that we don't know who's supposed to be responsible for and what exactly it is and who wants it.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:16]** Now, we need to figure out who wants this.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:21]** My first inclination would be, one, let's get this ship moving back toward Absalom.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:39]** Two, let's see if we can't go to the security station and see if we can't find some sort of dossier, forged or otherwise, that might be able to give us some sort of clue as to what is aboard this ship and who it is valuable to.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** I agree.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:42]** We will at least be able to find some means of tampering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:48]** I agree with the general plan, but I really think we got to do this map first because I'm hoping it'll lead us to that treasure.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:52]** And I don't want to take any chances about anything else happening to that.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** I think time's of the essence.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:53]** I agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:57]** I am not concerned about any treasure.

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:00]** I am concerned about the well-being of the people on the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:01]** They'll be fine.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Come on.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:05]** It's not going to take that long to check out this map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:14]** And Nico kind of goes over to Rick's shoulder, and he wraps his arm around the android's shoulder, kind of like buddy-buddy kind of thing.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:16]** He's like, all right, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** Roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:23]** All right, Rick, let's go over a couple of things.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:27]** There is a cargo on board this ship that people are willing to kill for.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:33]** Isn't it worth finding out for everybody on this ship exactly what it is?

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** And who wants it?

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** Yeah, yeah, listen to Business Boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** Dr. O'Kane, what are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:45]** Can I roll a diplomacy check on that?

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:48]** Dr. O'Kane, like, does not care.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:54]** He's like, this is not a conversation I care to have.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:59]** I want to solve the mystery of all of these things.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:02]** He's still wrapped up in, like...

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:08]** Where did they get their supplies from for this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:12]** He's still thinking about the diorama.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** Healing serum, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:28]** Meanwhile, Nico is trying to, on the Android subroutines, on its probably friend or foe icon, Nico just kind of out there for the listeners here, he's trying to kind of short Rick's...

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:34]** Rick's kind of friend or foe logic routines here, trying to say... I don't know if that's a computer check or a diplomacy check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Hey, can we do that to him?

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:37]** I would love to roll computers on him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:39]** I'd like to see you try that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** Oh, I'm not trying to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:42]** Rick says as he puts his hand on his pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:44]** No, he's not doing a computer check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:50]** This is diplomacy check, trying to... Then make a diplomacy check and tell me what you say, but not in that order.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:53]** Tell me what you say, or did you already say it?

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:54]** That's what I said.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Okay.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** Here's my check.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** Oh, shit.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:03]** That is a nine plus... Come on, give me something good.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:03]** Give me something good.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** What's my diplomacy?

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** It's plus eight.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** So that's 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:07]** Rick?

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** What am I supposed to roll?

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** It's a diplomacy check.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:17]** So I roll... He got a 17, so I mean... Oh, I just respond to that?

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:19]** Well, yeah, I would say to...

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:28]** It seemed like, Rick, you were a little bit hesitant and he's trying to convince you to care more about the treasure.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:32]** From a numbers perspective, I think he got it just barely.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** But I'm going to leave that up to you, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:40]** I can see your perspective on this, but I do not agree with your tactics.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:44]** The treasure and this relic are not to my concern.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:55]** Yes, we could die on this ship with the treasure, or we can be on our way with our lives, gentlemen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** This could be the primary motivator for everything.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** We could solve all the problems if we get this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:09]** We would not necessarily solve why the engines fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:12]** Or what will happen to us when we return to the packed worlds.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** With a treasure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:20]** Nico's going to say, it's not often you get to say this, but for once, let's listen to the pirate guy.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** I think he's on it this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** What are you guys going to do?

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:26]** This is why we need another cast member.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** Because we're just going to end up split two and two.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** We need odd numbers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:41]** Here's is willing to go off to get this to separate from the group for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:45]** And Nico's willing to go with him.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** If you guys aren't coming, we're going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** Split the party?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** You guys want to split the party?

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** That'll be your choice, honestly.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:54]** It's you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:02]** So Rick wants to head down to Keeve because he's the next suspect in all of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** Sorry, they.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:08]** If you want to go spy on Keeve here.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:17]** then the best thing to do would be to go to the security ops room and see what he's doing.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:21]** That way you get to monitor him without him knowing where we're at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** Is there a security room?

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:27]** You haven't found one yet.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:29]** You're likely, your best guess is this.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** It's probably somewhere on the bridge.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:35]** There's some access port that you would be able to go through and make that happen.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** Where you just were?

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** Yeah, where you just were.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:42]** Alternatively, you could go see Keeve and then also look at the places on the map at the same time.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:45]** Since that is the engineering deck in the lower deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** That's a great idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:48 - 00:51:11]** so before we do all of that um sorry i was reading up on my character a little bit more uh i took the bounty hunter theme i think or i don't know where it falls into it's not a theme or one of the other ones okay but i'm able to make a mark and then i get a minus d minus five dc for culture or bounty hunter checks on that mark

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:20]** The problem is if I kill the mark or something before I figure it out, then I get penalized for a week.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:27]** But part of that, though, I think it's actually Hunter...

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:58]** getting all mixed up now there's so many different rules anyways I was gonna make that make Algiata my mark okay and the so it says checks to recall knowledge about your mark as well as to recall knowledge about law enforcement individuals and practices okay by five sure so can I see her data pad one last time and run through that and and just make some kind of like filter through my head if I'd recognize anything


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:21]** yeah that's fine bounty hunter i would say what are you trying to get out of it you're just trying to look through her thing because then just make a computer check and then i would just lower the dc by five in order to see if there's anything else well my computers are shit um i actually don't even have computers but you're not training computers okay yeah um then you could just do more of like yeah go ahead


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:24]** So, like, Algiata herself, does she have any kind of criminal background?

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:26]** What is her relationship to this ship?

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:29]** She's clearly got some connection to another bounty hunter.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:32]** So, she's my mark.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:37]** So, like, I just have kind of insight on her history is the way that I read that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** Okay.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:44]** The problem is that you haven't, like... The problem is that you... I don't know.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** I think...

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:55]** You're essentially trying to get information that you might not already have, but you haven't been necessarily doing that from the beginning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:55 - 00:53:00]** That's one of the things I wish I would have gone back and... Sure.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:00]** No, no, no.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:00]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:02]** But I don't want to no-and you.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** I want to yes-and you.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:06]** So I think it's a really cool idea.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** I think... Do this for me.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** Maybe roll a...

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:36]** let's see what am i looking for here maybe roll like a culture check is that is that what you're trying to see and that's the thing is i don't even have culture but it says culture or for my profession and for bounty hunter okay that's four then then give me a bounty hunter check okay and i will lower the dc by five in order to figure out something else or to recall something else i got a 12 plus 4 16 16 okay

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:49]** anything nefarious anything nefarious 16 is not bad this is what I'm gonna say you seem to recall

**[00:53:51 - 00:54:01]** hearing a couple of things and, and you kind of put together a couple of things, nothing necessarily huge, but a couple of little flavor things.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:17]** One, you kind of recall that and you kind of think about it and you're like, maybe clearly Algiata and Trostenec must have known each other before they got on the ship.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:22]** And then you start to wonder, well, how long have they known each other?

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:26]** And is there anybody that might know more about that?

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:31]** And you think maybe Graf might know more about that.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** Keeve, they might know more about that.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:38]** it seems like that might be something to kind of jump in on, right?

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:41]** You're like, well, what is the nature of their relationship?

**[00:54:42 - 00:55:00]** You also know that from looking at the picture with Professor Bird and Benjamin, the person who bears a familial resemblance to Algiada doesn't seem, thinking about Algiada's age, Riforian's age, you don't think that it's her father.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:03]** You think it could be some sort of a brother or cousin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:05]** I'll relay all of this to the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:09]** And that's what you can kind of put together.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:11]** Nothing else necessarily from her data pad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** Anyone got any theories?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** So what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:22]** I'm still for going to the security.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:29]** Here's kind of like reading the room and seeing if we're going to all go to check out the map.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:30]** What was that?

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** Check out the...

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:57]** the security we can look at things along the way here's but i am heading down to see keeve okay yeah and you can look at things along the way all right we'll follow you that far this best break off to do we gotta do okay so where do you all want to go do you guys want to circle back to the pools yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:58]** Along the way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:07]** Yeah, so we'll go down the side ladder that'll drop us off right where the goblins were before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** Okay.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:13]** Oh, so you want to go down the left ladder that's here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Yeah.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:17]** Yeah, so go down that, pop up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** Okay.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** Let me reveal it for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:22]** Hop up here or here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** Am I close, John?

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:24]** No.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:29]** For the listener, I'm just randomly clicking on the black parts of the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:31]** I just highlighted where you're at.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** I was close.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Were you?

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:36]** Okay.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:40]** So you all come down here and you want to go check out the gym.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:44]** So first we'll do another perception check on that hallway where the goblins were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** Ah, okay.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:48]** So you go down to where the goblins were pulling things apart.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:53]** The stack of dead goblins are still there because nobody's cleaned them up yet?

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** No, they're not there.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:56]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** Clean up on aisle 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** Question.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:01]** I don't know if this would be a life science check, but I don't have life science.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:05]** Can a bar quest eat dead bodies and gain their powers?

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** Whatever you said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:07]** I'll just tell you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** Yeah, roll for it.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:12]** Yeah, Rick will just ask Dr. Oak.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:17]** Do you think that the bar quest can consume the undead or the dead?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:19]** I rolled a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:24]** Yes, Barkas can consume any type of living or dead creature.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** Oh my god!

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:27]** And assume their form?

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** No, not assume their form.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** They just gain strength.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** Yeah, they take their power from them.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:31]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:35]** So the question now is, who's been collecting these dead bodies?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:41]** Nico's gonna say... Well, I think... I don't think you need a wisdom check to know that Song...

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:44]** was somebody who was going to go around and help kind of clean things up.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:46]** So that is one theory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** Sure, sure.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** For the Barkas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** You all go give me your perception checks in the hallway here.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:58]** Nico and Dr. Okay, I don't know if you guys are going down as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** 19 plus 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:03]** Nico's also going to... Here, we got a lot of things.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:06]** If you zoom out, they're closer to the center of the map.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** Nico, you were saying?

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:09]** Teleportation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:21]** Nico's also going to throw out, he's also going to throw out, well, we do know that our Yosuke friend as well also left there.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:24]** And we do know that the person in that grading had to be small.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** And compressible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** And compressible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:28]** Yosuke's are not quite compressible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** What was your roll on the perception check?

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:33]** Mine was a 24.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:34]** 24, 13.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:34]** 10.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:35]** 10.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:41]** It seems like they're just a bunch of ship systems behind the wiring.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** Nothing of any interest.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** Let's keep moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** 24 didn't see anything?

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:48]** Why would you even ask for a perception then?

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** You're the one who's looking.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** Hughes continues to move up towards the gym.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** Okay, so you all go to the gym.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:01]** You walk in.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** Water's bubbling.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:08]** And you go look, I presume, in the pools?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:12]** I did a perception check on these some time ago.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:14]** You did, when you guys were in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:17]** You want to do another one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:19]** Yeah, I'll do perception on this far one.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** Nick, can you not control yourself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:24]** At the moment, I can control myself.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:26]** I just can't find it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** Oh, you got to zoom out.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:29]** I just put you over there.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:31]** I rolled an 18.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** An 18 to look in the water.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Okay.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** Here's... 13.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:37]** 13, sorry.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** Okay.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** Don't see anything in the water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:43]** What about, like, above the pools?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:47]** Doesn't seem to be anything... Gratings or any kind of... Wall panels?

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** Nope.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** Nothing.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** This is a 24...

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** 24.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** Again, nothing.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** Water seems to be cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:55 - 01:00:01]** Nico's going to look at the ceiling to see if there's anything up there, any type of clues, scarring, blood, water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** I'm not looking at the water.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** I'm looking all over.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:09]** You don't see anything, again, that is of any... Seems like the mat is very used.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:12]** There might be some marks on the mat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:14]** How about a 23 on the perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Doesn't reveal anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:21]** Rick is going to actually step into the pool.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:26]** And then walk over to the corner and reach down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:26]** You instantly die.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:31]** You go and you wade through.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:33]** Nothing seems to be popping out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** There's nothing here?

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:38]** Oh, this is so frustrating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** Glad to see you're invested now.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:44]** Let's check out the rest of the map, eh?


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:46]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** All right, let's finish up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:51]** Let's finish up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:54]** Yeah, so now we go down the ladders to the others.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:58]** Okay, which, you gonna go back the left ladders or the right ladders?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:01]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:02]** Can I zoom in?

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:04]** I say to the right ladders.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:06]** The right ladders.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:07]** Yeah.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:13]** So you all walk out in the hallway and you walk over to the ladders here.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:17]** And then let me show you where you come out.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** And you come out in here.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:26]** If you want to zoom out, you'll see the little patch that I opened up down on the engineering deck.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:27]** It's on the right on the bottom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:39]** So Rick is going to grab his artillery, this heavy weapon, and he's just casually holding it as if it's just an assault rifle.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** Getting ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:46]** Yeah, because you walked down into... It's similar to when Dr. O.K.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** and Rick, you came down here.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** So this is not your first time down here.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:50]** It's your first time down this entrance.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:52]** Nico in here, this might be your first time down here.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:56]** But you walk into a small 15 by 10 room, maybe 20 room,

**[01:01:56 - 01:02:01]** And there's a door right in front of you and there's a door immediately to your left.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:06]** There are little like panels that you can kind of see through at the top.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:15]** The top, the door in front of you looks to be a longish hallway with a door on the left and something on the right, probably some consoles.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:22]** The door on the left, when you look through, it seems to be like another part of an engine bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:44]** um here's we'll look through that and check for any signs of anything going on you don't see anything going on all right um you want a perception on just like the halls you can roll perception on the hall without opening the door if you want oh wait there's a door there dude there are two doors so this is like a little room with the with the ladder yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:54]** Yeah, I rolled a 16 perception on the doors then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** 16 perception on the doors.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:56]** The doors look to be standard.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** They'll open if you want to go through them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:00]** Is there any compressible slime on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:03]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:09]** Here's will then, I guess, open, stealthily open the door to the engine bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:13]** Nico's going to draw out both of his blasters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** That's a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:16]** Sorry.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:18]** I just sci-fi stealth is funny to me.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:20]** Cause it's like, I'm going to stealthily open the door.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:27]** So he like, you slowly and quietly push the button and then it goes, Oh, yeah, that's, that's what I was going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:28]** Uh, but okay.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** All right.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:29]** All right.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:32]** You can't slowly open that door, but you want to open the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:33]** Yes.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:34]** Okay.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:37]** He goes, shh, and opens the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:39]** And tries to tell the door.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:42]** He stealthily, like, he grabs the door and, like, slides with it.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** Oh, my gosh.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** I love it.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:55]** You look in and you see a room that is filled with consoles and screens seem to be displaying a lot of information about ship systems.

**[01:03:56 - 01:04:07]** There seems to be a drive in the back that is probably has to do with, let's see, probably one of the drift engines.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** And then as part of that,

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:21]** Yeah, that looks to be the drift engine, the big circular drive in the back with two concentric white circles and this crackling energy in between it.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:23]** But it doesn't seem to be obviously working.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:28]** But that seems to be the main power where a lot of these things come from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:35]** Rick is going to open the other door just to clear it, to make sure there's nobody in there.

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:37]** I'm going to come through our backs.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:38]** We're coming through our backs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:39]** Okay.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:43]** So you are still in the other room and you're going to open that door.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:46]** Okay.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:52]** So when you open that door, you see a long hallway that just extends down.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:54]** And Rick, you recognize this as you're like, oh, that's right.

**[01:04:55 - 01:05:00]** I think I saw around here was when Dr. O'Kane and I saw one of the


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:09]** Yes, we saw Algiotta and Trostnik down this corridor, didn't we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:14]** Yes, Algiotta and Trostnik were over, and he points...

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:17]** Standing right there when they had that discussion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:19]** Standing right in the center.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** Here's Nico.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:22]** What are you guys thinking as you're in this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:26]** This room is the bottom left of the bottom right part of this map, correct?

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:27]** Where that red circle is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:30]** That map looks like it'd be in this area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:33]** So here basically makes a beeline for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:35]** So Rick just wanted to check the hull.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** I'm going to do a perception to make sure there's nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:37]** I'll say this.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:42]** From what you can see here, it looks like there's another area just like this.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:47]** And from what you know about the ship, there's probably another area just like this on the other side.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:53]** So on the map where it's looking in a circle left side, then there's probably something over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:57]** Got it.

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:02]** Nico's going to take a look at some of the screens in the room there.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:08]** And he wants to do a computer's check to try to just do a standard diagnostic thing.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:11]** But I think, will I need to slice into this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:14]** They are locked.

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:18]** So you would need to hack in if you want to see some of what's in there.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:20]** But I can tell you just what's on there.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:23]** Go ahead and give me a check on that.


## Speaker_0

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:28]** That is going to be a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:30]** 15.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:32]** Dr. O.K.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:34]** and Rick, what are you guys thinking as you're going through?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:41]** I just want to do perception checks and make sure, see if there's any tracks, anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:48]** I want to look for devices of sabotage, traps, or... Okay.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:49]** Keeve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:51]** Okay.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:52]** Or Keeve.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:53]** Okay.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** Nick, you're not able to get in.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:59]** You think for a second that you were able to, but you weren't quite high enough.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:09]** But from what you can see in the output that it's showing, it seems like it's just relaying a lot of ship engine and system information.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:11]** Okay.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:15]** So it's a lot of control modules and things like that that are kind of setting that up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:17]** Can I do an engineering check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:19]** To do what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:25]** I wanted to see if I understand any of the diagnostic boards and some of the information that's flowing through.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:25]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:25]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:27]** Oh, there we go.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:28]** There's some better luck.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:28]** That's 25.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:29]** 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:30]** Yeah.

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:34]** You're able to kind of piece together the information that's coming through.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:35]** It seems like it's legit.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:36]** It seems like it is.

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:39]** You make sense of the information that you can see.

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:41]** It does seem like it's connected.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:43]** What's the information that's coming through?

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:47]** Is it telling me how the drives have been sabotaged or not activated?


## Speaker_0

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:47]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:52]** No, there's no way that you can tell that without even trying to get in, per se, to the computer system itself.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:57]** But you can see that, obviously, the drift drive is not active.

**[01:07:58 - 01:08:02]** But as you go to each console, they're each displaying different information.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:06]** So there's ones that display what's going on with some of the fuel that's going on.

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:08]** There's some that's the temperature of some of the systems.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:10]** It's all across the board.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:11]** Okay.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:13]** Well, then, John, here's my last question.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:17]** Can I use a punishment point to roll another computer's check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:21]** You got a high computer check, didn't you?

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:21]** What?

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:24]** Didn't you get a high computer check?

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** You can also do a take 20.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:25]** No.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:26]** You got a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:28]** You can't take 20 on computers check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:29]** No.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:29]** Can't?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:29]** No.

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:30]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:32]** Can I use a punishment?

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:33]** Yeah, sure.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:34]** Who doesn't say you can't?

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:34]** Perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:38]** I'll say you can use your punishment to re-roll your computers check.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:38]** All right, perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:43]** Does it say under computers checks that you can't use take 20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:44]** Yes.

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:45]** Okay.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:46]** That's a 20, not natural.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:48]** 10 on the die, plus 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:49]** Plus 10.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:49]** Okay.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:54]** Um, yeah, you're able to get into this particular computer here.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:56]** You are, what do you want to see?

**[01:08:56 - 01:09:01]** You want to see and try and see how the drift is broken or how the drift drive is broken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:02]** That's correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:03]** Okay.

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:04]** All right.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:07]** It seems like it's something that affects a lot of different systems.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:10]** It seems like it's something that is a pretty pervasive fix.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:17]** You would need a lot of time to go through and see every little thing, try and put it together with some engineering roles like, oh, what is this?

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:18]** What is this?

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:20]** What specific system is this here?

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:24]** It seems like it's something that is a large issue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:27]** I don't mean to interrupt, but... Yeah, Kev?

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:30]** Access unsecured system.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:33]** Page 138 in the core rulebook.

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:33]** Yes.

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:34]** Thank you, Paizo.

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:39]** A standard action, you can use computers to access an unsecured computer system.

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:41]** The DC is blah, blah, blah.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:44]** Firewalls generally take a 10.

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:52]** Unlike other tasks for computer skill, you can attempt to access a system untrained if you take 20 on the task, requiring two minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:52]** That's fine.

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:54]** If you're untrained and if it's unsecured.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:09:55 - 01:10:00]** I am trained and insecure.

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:06]** Before we moved over, I wanted to just kind of see if I could see the origin of what was happening.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:08]** You said it was pervasive, but what's the origin?

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:09]** What is actually wrong?

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:12]** Like, what caused the power outage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:14]** There's not just one system.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:16]** There's not just one system.

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:21]** You can't tell from just this one screen and this one computer what exactly is it that happened.

**[01:10:22 - 01:10:25]** Because the ship system is so extensive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:31]** All right, well then, go to everybody else, but when you come back, can I try to get access to all the other systems?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:32 - 01:10:34]** Yes, it's going to take you a while.

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:36]** But yes, that's not a problem.

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:37]** So take 50.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:39]** Here's, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:45]** Here's is, can he see through this door that leads to the other door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:49]** Yeah, you can see it looks to be another hallway, a similar system.

**[01:10:49 - 01:10:57]** You recognize what appears to be probably some sort of power core for the ship across the way, and then a longer hallway that goes up.

**[01:10:57 - 01:11:02]** And then there seems to be a door across the way, probably another thruster area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:07]** But here's would know from the map that on the other side of this door is where.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:09]** Is likely where that red circle is.

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:09]** Yeah.

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:11]** Or like even further.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:13]** You can see that there's another wall over there.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:15]** There seems to be another corridor across the way.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:17]** Looks like you're going to have to explore a little more to get to that area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:21]** Okay.

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:23]** He really wants to check it out, but he wants to be careful.

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:26]** So he's going to walk back up and regroup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:27 - 01:11:28]** Okay.

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:30]** Rick and Dr. Okay.

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:32]** Rick, you got a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:33]** I rolled a 23.

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:34]** A 23 on perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:35]** Okay.

**[01:11:35 - 01:11:40]** So you don't see anything of any like real worry there.

**[01:11:41 - 01:11:44]** There's no like sign of, you know, I don't know.

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:48]** What are you trying to look for exactly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:52]** I click on my infrared and I look for fingerprints.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:52]** Okay.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:55]** And Dr. Okay, what did you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:56]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:56 - 01:12:01]** I rolled a 22 on my perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:07]** Just looking for tracks that if anybody had come through here, if there's anything misaligned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:13]** Including looking at the roof to see if there's a grate or something.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:18]** Wherever that grating in the other room, where would that lead to type thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:18]** Okay.

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:20]** I'll say this.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:22]** You

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:37]** see that that this hallway does go down and this hallway does seem like it um like there have been people in this general area


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:38]** Like a spent coffee cup?

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:40]** What?

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:42]** Like there's an empty coffee cup?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:48]** No, just from your thermal... There's like a cigarette just... Yeah, there's just a cigarette sitting there just waiting.

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:50]** Sitting with some ash.

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:51]** Yeah, there's some ash on the floor.

**[01:12:51 - 01:13:01]** No, it does seem like here in particular there have been some sort of body signatures, like heat, recently.

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:05]** Like on any of these panels?

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:08]** No, like on the ground here.

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:12]** And then extending up more towards the back wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:14]** Dr.

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:17]** O.K., these computers seem to be of interest to at least somebody.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:20]** Do you have a high computer skill?

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:20]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:21]** Or should we...

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:24]** I do have a high computer skill.

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:25]** Thanks for asking, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:27]** So here, I'll say this.

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:30]** The heat doesn't seem like it's at the computer stations.

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:34]** It seems like it's going along towards the back wall.

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:36]** Fine, I'll follow that.

**[01:13:37 - 01:13:38]** Okay.

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:45]** As you're doing that, you kind of realize that you're like, oh, this area is one of the areas on the map that the goblins circled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:47 - 01:13:47]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:51]** This is why I was saying you guys could do both at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:52 - 01:13:53]** Why split the party?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:54 - 01:13:55]** So you all walk up.

**[01:13:56 - 01:13:56]** You walk around the corner.

**[01:13:56 - 01:13:58]** You see a large computer screen.

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:01]** This is probably a, what is that, maybe 80 feet.

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:06]** There's a huge screen that seems to be displaying a lot of information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:07]** High definition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:11]** Yeah, it's a super high definition short throw projector up at the top.

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:13]** Yeah, it's just throwing all this stuff.

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:14]** A couple things.

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:19]** Nico in here, give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:20]** All right.

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:22]** Something's going to jump out at them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:24]** 10.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:24]** 10?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:28]** 14 plus six, that's 20 for me.

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:31]** 20 from Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:34]** 10 from- You feel heavy breathing on your neck.

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:38]** You turn around, there's a giant alien that spits acid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:42]** This is good.

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:45]** Dr. Okay and Rick, you guys give me a perception check as well.

**[01:14:45 - 01:14:46]** What are you guys looking for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:48]** I'm so nervous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:50 - 01:14:52]** Okay.

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:53]** I feel good about this.

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:53]** Yeah.

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:54]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:55]** 13 and 34.

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:56]** 24.

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:56]** 24.

**[01:14:58 - 01:14:59]** I was like, holy cow.

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:04]** Because of two things are going to happen right now.

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:08]** Nico and here's here's you're walking back up.

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:10]** Nico, you're intently focused.

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:36]** dr okay and rick you're you guys are walking by and and rick the thermal thing is a little hand wavy and that like you obviously don't have a thermal system but like you are trying to by going through and looking it's like it does seem like maybe somebody's like pushed a chair chair seems like a little out of the way really um and this clearly seems like a very dusty part of the area like keeve they probably don't come around to you very often um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:40]** But Rick has like a high imagination, so in his head it seems like it's thermal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:40 - 01:15:41]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:42]** Enhance.

**[01:15:42 - 01:15:44]** Enhance, enhance.

**[01:15:44 - 01:15:44]** Let's go with one of them.

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:46]** Here's Nico.

**[01:15:47 - 01:15:59]** You all, from maybe 20 feet behind you, you all do hear the sound of like a... Sounds like something fell.

**[01:16:00 - 01:16:00]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:02]** No!

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:03]** No!


## Speaker_0

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:06]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:16:07 - 01:16:09]** Hey everyone, it's Kelly.

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:14]** When I started playing tabletop RPGs, I learned very quickly that it's usually not advisable to split the party.

**[01:16:15 - 01:16:21]** It's actually worked out for us when Rick and Dr. OK went off separately and found out some information that we may have not found out otherwise.

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:31]** But as you may have noticed, we've also come across some pretty beastly enemies, and if we weren't there to support each other with buffs or joint attacking them, who knows what might have happened.

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:39]** In this episode, we had different goals and so we kind of have decided to split our focus and we're sticking together at the moment and we're all getting what we want in the engine bay.

**[01:16:40 - 01:16:42]** But I don't know if we're going to split at a later point.

**[01:16:42 - 01:16:45]** What do you do for those of you that play tabletop RPGs?

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:50]** What do you do in these situations where you may have the same goal but disagree on the way forward?

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:53]** Or maybe have completely different goals.

**[01:16:53 - 01:16:54]** How do you resolve that?

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:55]** Do you split the party?

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:56]** What do you do?

**[01:16:57 - 01:16:59]** As always, super appreciate you all.

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:03]** Thanks for listening and see you next week.
