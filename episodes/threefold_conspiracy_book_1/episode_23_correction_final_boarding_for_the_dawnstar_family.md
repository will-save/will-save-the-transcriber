## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:07]** Last time on We'll Save, our group of adventurers investigated the rattled ship.

**[00:00:08 - 00:00:21]** After stumbling their way around the dark bowels of the ship, they return to a familiar cargo bay to find Song dead and a dwarf named God Weena armed to the teeth.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:24]** Fighting erupts after a startling revelation.

**[00:00:25 - 00:00:29]** Heirs killed the dwarf's entire family.

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:42]** After knocking Godwina unconscious, peace is interrupted again when a Vesk reinforcement barges into the room and raises a war cry to the pirate goddess, Besmara.

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:45]** What has our group stepped into?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on Milsade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** All right, I'm just going to say it.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:45]** I'm very excited to play.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** I'm just going to put it out there.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:51]** I really want to get going on the plan, as they say.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** Don't know who else says it.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** I say it.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:56]** Therefore, people will say it as well.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** But I have a question.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:04]** Because this is something that came up in our pre-roll chat about, you know.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** Typhoid Mary?

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:05]** Yeah.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:08]** Well, more about hauntings and ghosts.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:11]** And I just want to ask you guys if you believe in ghosts.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Is this a thing?

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** I feel like Nico does it.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** This is a full conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** Yeah, this is going to become something big.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** But it'd be fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:21]** How do we do it in three to five minutes max?

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:23]** We can either just say yes or no.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** We could just say yes or no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:28]** Have we defined ghost?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:55]** yeah I mean an actual spiritual being or just something that we don't understand that's chilling out like on some other frequency I've experienced things that I cannot understand this is like long conversation stuff man what give us a little spoiler I mean I have a joke if you guys are ready for it when am I not ready for a joke yeah we're waiting yeah that was the best answer


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** I would consider a ghost.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:03]** An albino on the right wing militant.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:06]** wing of Opus Dei.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Who whips himself secretly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** Yeah, that was over my head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:11]** Is that a deep cut from like Dan Brown?

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** Is that from like Dan Brown and like Angels and Demons?

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** That is.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:15]** Thank you.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** That is.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** Now that I know that.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:17]** Thank you.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** Well done, John.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:18]** Thank you.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:20]** I might cut that joke, but you know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** It's all good.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** Here's a better ghost joke.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** He said soy un fantasma.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** He said soy una fantasma.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:27]** Ah.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:34]** Wait, Kev, give a teaser trailer of your ghost story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** So my parents, we bought a house.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:43]** And when we moved into it, the family that moved away, there was an older man that lived with the family.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:47]** And we got a letter from hospice.

**[00:03:47 - 00:04:09]** for him you know so and you know how hospice works but shortly after we got the hospice letter weird things in the house started happening in the room that he said or that we were told was like his room that like he lived in the most and the weirdest thing is like out of all these weird things that happened um my mom finally did like a weird seance and was like dear bill if you are the one and all that stuff and

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:17]** No, she just spoke out loud to the quote-unquote ghost and was like, if this is you haunting us, we're not trying to take your space from you.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** We're wanting to share it with you.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** And just talked to the ghost and quote-unquote reasoned with it.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** I like it.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** And everything stopped after that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** That's so heartwarming.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** It's very freaky.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:33]** Yeah, there's a lesson, but also kind of like, you know, it's interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:39]** That's the only thing that I've experienced in my life that I'm like, and you guys, I'm a very cynical engineer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:45]** I was going to say, you're not like one to really follow those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** Not at all, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:55]** It's almost like you're Nico in the Starfinder world and you don't believe in the gods.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:00]** But that's the thing is I look back at that experience and I'm like, man, no, no, no.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:05]** The things that I witnessed did not adhere to the rules of physics as I understand them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** To be fair, it was before you went to school to learn more about physics.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:09]** That is true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** Maybe you just didn't understand physics.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** No, no, no.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:16]** My memory of it serves the same.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** It hasn't changed at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:43]** not like doubting it in retrospect now like i what i saw was definitely unexplainable by anything other than you know the supernatural i wish i've had an experience like that i've never had any like crazy ghost experiences uh my sister once like when we were kids like she saw an angel or something like that at like the foot of the bed and she was like look kelly look because we slept in the same room and i just kind of played along with it

**[00:05:43 - 00:06:10]** yeah she i got all my inspiration for here from my sister she was a pirate for a while and her younger for a while but they oh my gosh um and then like and then and so i just kind of played along with it the next day we told my mom and she was like mom mom we saw an angel kelly and i both saw an angel and then my my uh my mom was like oh what color was it and then i was like having not seen the angel and didn't really care i was just like oh it was blue and my mom was like oh

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** oh, wow, that's so cool, Kelly.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** What a blessed experience you had.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:17]** And then Natalie was like, yeah, I saw it, but mine was pink.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:20]** And then my mom just, like, ripped on my sister.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:25]** And she was like, she was like, Natalie, angels cannot be pink, Natalie.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:29]** Do you know what that reminds me of?

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** The Keanu Reeves movie.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** Also a comic.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:37]** I don't know how well they followed it.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:38]** Constantine.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:43]** The comic is amazing compared to that film.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** Yeah, I imagine.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** And the show, I watched the show.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** The show was really good.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:48]** Yeah.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:50]** Anyway.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** Anyway, it's time.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:59]** In the film, the sister have a similar experience around apparitions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** That's cool.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** I hear that's an amazing movie.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** I haven't yet seen it.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:06]** Constantine's like so good.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** They're talking about a sequel now.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:08]** Yeah, they are.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** Hell yeah.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** You know what else they're talking about a sequel to?

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:12]** Episode 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:15]** Which would be episode 23.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:15]** 23.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** What you're doing right now?

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** Funny thing real quick.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** One more thing before we stop.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:21]** How dare you?

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:28]** It was funny that John... Kevin, when John asked you for the trailer, you gave us the full synopsis.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** I gave you the synopsis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:29]** You're right.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:32]** I didn't... You didn't give the trailer.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:35]** It's a novel story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:36]** It is.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:42]** I was just thinking if all trailers did that... Nick, is that your audition for Rolls Lawyer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** Did you...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** No, that is not my audition.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** That might have been his audition.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:52]** That would have been the William Hung of auditions for Rules Warrior.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** Poor William Hung.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:53]** All right.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:58]** That'd be the William Hung of all lawyer, but Rules Warrior auditions.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:58]** Thank you, 2007.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:00]** I will say this, though.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** Was that when he was around?

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:01]** 2008?


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:09]** I highly recommend doing ghost tours if you're at least at all curious.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** I've never done that.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:10]** Those are cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:11]** We should all go.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:15]** Let's do it as a group, and then we'll live stream it, and it'll be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:17]** We'll be like, Kevin was right the whole time.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:23]** If you're following us on Twitter, you can find us at what ghost tour we're going to go on together.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** Is that the name of the handle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** We'll save the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** At what ghost tour?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:30]** At what ghost tour does Will Save go on?

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** It's a really long handle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** I'm right next to the Queen Mary.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** We could do that.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:37]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** Yeah, super down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** They have a wine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** What?

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:43]** Oh, I think actually I gave it up.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:43]** Never mind.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:46]** Forget it.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:46]** That's okay.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** It's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** Cut that out.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** So we were in the middle of combat.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** Mortal combat.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** Rick opens fire.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** Against...

**[00:08:55 - 00:09:00]** Presumably starfishers, as Kev suggested.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:00]** No.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:02]** That's what I'm saying is they're not starfishers.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:05]** I would assume all starfishers are these weird octopi things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Oh, I see.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** I learned from last week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:08]** It's octopi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:11]** It's astrozoans.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** That's the plural of octopus.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** Yeah, the plural of octopus is astrozoan.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:14]** Yep.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** So here's the thing.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:17]** We're just going to jump right back in.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:26]** Last time you all came up out of the secret corridor into door number two and you peeked your head into the cargo bay.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:26]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** But we didn't kill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** The starboard cargo bay.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** We didn't kill.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:29]** What?

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** We didn't kill Dawnstar.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:32]** So maybe.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** I'm getting there.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** I'm getting there in the recap.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:36]** But I'm saying maybe she's an astrozoan.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** But hold your theories for a second.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** I can't wait.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:40]** Hold up.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** Hold up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:59]** I can't help but notice, while, John, you're pulling whatever up, that the Roll20 backgrounds have gone from, like, pleasant, you know, chill wave, like, Guardians of the Galaxy retro-themed Starcraft to now... Darker Hallways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:02]** Yeah, it's like the Emperor's personal, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:04]** I feel like I'm about to get executed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** I think this one is a really good one.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:24]** So here's the thing, just for everyone listening at home, since you're not a part of this, on Roll20, we've got little landing pages that have the Threefold Conspiracy title and everything, and I throw up some images behind them, and yes, they have gone progressively from nice and pleasant and colorful to darker and more intense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** I think this one's the creepiest one.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:27]** There could be an alien behind that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:29]** Because... Oh, I'm so excited!

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:32]** Is a lot going to happen right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:44]** If you have just been, you know, casually listening to we'll say for the past few months, and then you got to episode 23 and you're like, maybe today's the day I'm going to really like, let it sink in.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** I'm just going to say, let it sink in over the next couple of weeks.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:52]** It's been happening for a while, but things building, building up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:55]** John also made me roll a D 20 before the, I did make you roll a D 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** Scares the fuck out of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:01]** I'm with you on that one, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:05]** You came out of the cargo door into the starboard cargo bay.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:10]** Nico, Rick were smart and stealthy and went behind a crate.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** Here's was not stealthy.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:13]** was smart.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** A little bit of a split there.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:21]** And you all confronted the voice that ended up belonging to Godwina Dawnstar.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Retcon from Longstar.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:28]** And she asked Here's...

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:29]** is that you?

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** And said, you killed my family and then attacked.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:41]** And then you all handily rolled very well and took her to the point of unconsciousness where she is currently behind a crate near the door.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:45]** Now song has been laying motionless in the center of the starboard cargo bay.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** Let's hope they're okay.

**[00:11:49 - 00:12:06]** At the end of last episode, as Nico, I believe, successfully trick attacked and took down Dawnstar, then there was the large Vesk that came through and shouted a war cry.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:13]** And it is that Vesk's turn as we start here on episode 23 of

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Oh, so good.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:16]** Fake news.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:20]** How is it their turn if they just ran all the way down a hallway and opened a door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:21]** I don't know.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:26]** It's almost as if they were told from Longstar, Dawnstar, that you were there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** But we're in initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:30]** Six seconds later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:35]** Yeah, you can't give them two moves and an action.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** Rules, lawyer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** What are you talking about?

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:38]** What are you talking about?

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:41]** I didn't say that they had that.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:44]** I'm just saying that they moved up to the door.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** Think about it this way.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** They have an initiative.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** It was rolled.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:53]** It was known as soon as the announcement was made.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:55]** They have been moving since then.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** I just don't believe you.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:56]** That's all.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:01]** I believe in Joss more than I believe in the GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** Think about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:06]** They can move pretty far on their turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:10]** I move for votes of no confidence in John Swann's leadership.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:11]** Rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** We need that sound clip on Wilson.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:16]** We just need the king to come and break up parliament.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** That's what we need.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:19]** Well, it's the queen now, but historically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:26]** It was at the end of their turn that they shouted the war cry, and as that happened,

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:36]** Nico and Rick, you noticed another figure come up to stand next to the vest of a woman.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:41]** The vest has these chipped beard spikes.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:50]** And the woman has this red hair and just seems to also... They all have this red and black theme of what they wear.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:54]** And I'm showing her now on roll 20.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** And she also runs up...

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** That is their turn.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** If you would let me finish.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** Kev, I could have told you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:06]** No, you said it's their turn now after they made those actions.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** Watch yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** So they are there.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** It is their turn.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** They went.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:18]** The Vesk shouted, For Bismara!

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** Or something like that.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:25]** And then the human woman shows up as well, looking cool and calculated.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:31]** And now, Kev, as you have been so eagerly awaiting for a week, it is your turn.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:32]** Oh, it is my turn.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** What do you want to do on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** Oh, OK.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:43]** So Rick is going to move to here like that.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:48]** Oh, so, yeah, Rick is going to back up behind this barrel directly in front of these two.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:55]** He's going to raise his gun and he's going to ask them.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:56]** Who are you?

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** We do not mean to fight.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** And I hate doing this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:09]** And the woman is going to respond immediately and say, we're the starfishers and you need to put everything down right now and surrender your weapons.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** That's not going to happen.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:12]** We're not going to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:13]** Hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:16]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:19]** And Rick is going to hold an action to fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:23]** Are you going to delay or set a ready in action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** I'm going to ready in action.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** They do the same thing.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:28]** There's no difference.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** Ready is a trigger.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** Delay is you just wait.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:38]** I'm going to ready to shoot them if they do any aggressive actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:39]** Okay.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** So that will mean that when... Which one?

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** The vest or the woman?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** Oh, it has to be a specific one.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:49]** Who has the higher initiative order?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:49]** I don't know.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** I'll say the Vesk.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:56]** You can come in at any time, but if you want to say, okay, so the Vesk.

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:01]** So when they shoot, remember that what you're doing is not purely defensive, so you will go after the trigger.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** Does that make sense?

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:06]** And then that will be your new turn in the initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:08]** If they're shooting at me, though, I would go first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:09]** No.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:14]** No, it has to be a purely defensive action in order for you to go before the trigger.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Or as the trigger?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:19]** What would define a purely defensive action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:22]** Like take cover, going prone or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:25]** Yeah, something that is just entirely here.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:27]** I'm going to go to ready and action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** Like a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** Ready to action.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:39]** If your ready to action is purely defensive, such as choosing the total defense action if a foe you are facing shoots at you, it occurs just before the event that triggered it.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:47]** If the ready to action is not purely defensive, such as shooting a foe if they shoot at you, it takes place immediately after the triggering event.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:47]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:50]** Cool.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:54]** I need a sound drop for the more you know.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** More you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:02]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:04]** The more you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:06]** What do you think about that, Kev?

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** Does that strike your fancy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:10]** Can I do fight defensively as?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:15]** You can do it like a total defense or fight defensively.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:18]** I'll say that if you want to do a fight defensively attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:19]** That's an action, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:22]** The problem is that it's not purely defensive.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:27]** And as we've stated last time, it needs to be by the letter of the text.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:29]** And it says, purely defensive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** Yes.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:34]** And I'm trying... Sorry, there's a lot of things to read.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:36]** There's just so much.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:39]** As the rules lawyer, I don't think you're allowed to complain about that.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:42]** I'm also a very slow reader.

**[00:17:43 - 00:18:11]** total defense would make sense because then you would literally like you don't do anything yeah where fight defensively you can take or you can fight defensively when attacking as part of a standard action if you do so you take Atlanta's floor penalty to attacks and gain a plus two yeah so you're saying total action or total defense counts as a defensive action but fight defensively does not yeah because you're still fighting

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** It's okay.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:18]** Well, I'm going to... Apparently it's a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** I thought it was a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** Standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** Okay.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:26]** So you're going to do total defense as a ready action.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:26]** Well, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** I might as well just do total defense then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:28]** Okay.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** So you're going to do total defense now.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:30]** Yes.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Until the start of your next turn.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** Okay.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:34]** And I don't lose initiative order that way.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** You don't.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** So plus four to your AC for the next round.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** Okay.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** Until the start of your next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:43]** But they don't know that because I'm still pointing my giant artillery laser at them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** Yeah, I wouldn't know that at all.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** Definitely not.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:45]** Nope.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** It is.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** Here's his turn.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** Oh, I just quit out of Roll20.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** Damn it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:52]** Keep going, Here's.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:54]** Here's is going to stay hidden for now.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** And he's going to try to...

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:02]** use to figure out who they are if he recognizes them from his pirating times.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:05]** So that is a wisdom check, I guess.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:09]** Perhaps I'll have no greater luck than I did before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** You would get plus two from your perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:14]** Do you have profession pirate under your skills?

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:40]** under my skills no i am a former pirate yeah technically so if you would have added added pirate as your profession then you would have a profession's um skill that you could use as for certain things for checks where you have to that might be related to being a pirate so maybe off air we'll take care of that and get you some yeah we'll yeah yeah yeah we will do that fair all right cool so should i ask you in the meantime


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:44]** I'll say that you can add two, because it's pretty much like you're going to take care of it and probably do that.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:48]** But the thing is that we might need to check out your skill, so it might cause some other things.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:50]** I think for now, it's innocuous enough.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** Plus two.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:51]** Real cool.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:52]** Totally fine.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** You are a pirate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:55]** Got it.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:58]** I only rolled a four, so that's just going to be a six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** You really have no idea.

**[00:19:59 - 00:19:59]** Yeah.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:00]** Absolutely not.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** The starfishers, you're like, I don't know.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:04]** I have no idea who the starfishers are.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** Really doesn't ring a bell at all.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:06]** Sad.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** That is sad.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** Indeed.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** They knew your name, though.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:11]** They do.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** Godwina knew your name.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** What do you want to do on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** I still think that they're all octopi.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:17]** Astrazones.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:18]** Astrazones.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** I pissed off a bunch of octopi.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** Are they astrazones?

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:23]** Because you can't be a starfisher if you're not a starfish.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:25]** That's the whole thing, is they're space starfishes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:28]** I didn't know you were a starfisher, Rick.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:31]** Is this one of those double agent moments?

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:31]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** And he just transforms into an astrozoan.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** You turn into an astrozoan?

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** You've been an astrozoan this whole time.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** His shell breaks open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:39]** Yeah.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** Here's, what do you do with your turn?

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:48]** Here's is going to remain hidden so that he could, like, maybe, I don't know, have an opportunity later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:48 - 00:21:15]** okay if that makes sense yeah they probably can't see you there if you want to i'm not going to make you roll a stealth check you're in a point where they wouldn't be able to see you and you're not moving so yeah yeah okay yeah i feel like it could be an advantage to have someone hidden everyone else is visible at the moment so we'll see maybe it's a good idea okay okay let's see what happens it's the top of round three nico orion the resident gymnast what are you doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:19]** Nico is definitely going to run back behind cover here.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:25]** And... Yeah, he's going to do total defense as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** You going to say anything?

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:30]** He'll say, back up if you know what's good for you.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** Back up, buddy.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** Intimidation.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:34]** Can I do an intimidation roll on this guy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** Sure, why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** You could also do diplomacy.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:40]** I don't think this sounds like diplomacy, Cap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:43]** Well...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** It's not going to do me much good.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:47]** That was a six plus what?

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** Six plus eight.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** So maybe 14.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:50]** It's a 14.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** It's a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:52]** Saying you better back up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** All right.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** I like it.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** I like it.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** I like it.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:57]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** What are you doing on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** Yeah.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:12]** I don't think we're going to be able to talk our way out of this, but I'm willing to go along.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** I can't.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:14]** Do I know?

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:17]** I could hear them, but I don't see them.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:19]** Yeah, you don't see them.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:21]** So I think I'm just going to wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:50]** like delay action wait or just like not do anything on your yeah hold on what's it gonna be 30 feet 30 feet i'm just gonna pop around the corner and be like hello hey just enough space right there because they're standing at the open door and and you just pop hey what's up yeah so i guess it won't be purely defensive right if i shoot at them nope not at all for ready to action

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:56]** Yeah, but I'll change my initiative to be purely reactionary, basically.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:56]** Okay.

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:02]** If I do this, where I shoot one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:08]** So if one of them comes in front, because they're both standing out in the hallway, if one of them comes into your line of sight, you're going to shoot them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:11]** If you delay, you don't have to have an action ready.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Right, that's the whole point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** You don't need a trigger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** I see, I see.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:22]** Or... Or... And for delay, if it comes back to your turn, you can just choose to delay again, right?

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:25]** If you don't actually jump initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:27]** What if I were to actually just... Say again, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:27]** Right?

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** That's what it says in delay.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:33]** If you don't actually jump initiative order, then you don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** Yeah, I think they'll say that.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:34]** Like, you can choose.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** All right.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:39]** If you don't do anything by the end of that turn, then you keep your initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** Here's what I'm actually going to do.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:46]** I'm going to give myself a booster.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:46]** Okay.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** What kind of booster?

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** I'm going to give myself a minor booster.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** Minor booster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:55]** So he reverts the age back to 15 years old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:02]** Yeah, no, so I can attempt a medicine check as, like, an odd song.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** Who knows what's up with them?

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** Yeah.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:14]** Using a minor boost or biohack allows you to attempt a medicine check on targets you affect so long as the target is within range of your custom micro lab.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:19]** This doesn't require any additional time or action beyond making the attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:39]** okay yeah okay so you're gonna do it on song yeah or yourself i'll do it on song okay sure you're gonna do it on song you're gonna attack song give me your attack roll and i believe your attack roll 14 14 i'm gonna say that's a hit because they are unmoving on the ground

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:42]** So I can do a medicine check now, right?

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** Yeah, so give me your medicine check.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** Give me your medicine roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:54]** You're just trying to see what they're... I'm trying to do... I can do any medicine check, right?

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Like any medicine skill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** Why is this not popping up?

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:02]** Do you just want to do... I'll just say that if you want to do medicine checks just to see where they're at, that's fine.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:03]** Okay.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:07]** It's not in here under first aid or anything, but I'm going to say if you just want to see what's going on with them.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** It's 21...

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:13]** Yeah, you can tell pretty immediately that they are lifeless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** We'll see.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** Song's dead.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:17]** And then I'll just run back behind cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:21]** Song, the stakes have been raised.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:26]** Song, lifeless in the center of the starboard cargo bay.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** Great.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:28]** Wonder what that means.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** Ups the ante here.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:35]** It is back to the vest turn.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** And I believe it was Nico who said...

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:39]** What did you say, Nico?

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:40]** What was your intimidation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:44]** My intimidation was a 14, but my intimidation was like, back off.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** Don't do it.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** Don't do it.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:46]** Back off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** Don't do it, he says.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:55]** The vest looks at you and says, stay right where you are.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:57]** Why don't you?

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:02]** And then is going to fire at Nico.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:27]** nico nico i just want you to be prepared for this this is i get a plus four to my you do indeed you do indeed and they are going to they're doing a full action they have this large hunting rifle that they lower at you the first shot misses flies by you hits the crate behind you

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** And the next attack misses as well.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:32]** I'm not going to use this dice anymore because screw that dice because we're all low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** He didn't even bother asking what your AC was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:36]** Nope.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:36]** Nope.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** It was pretty low.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** It definitely would not have hit with the total defense.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:42]** I kind of picture the total defense where you're like, no, don't hit.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** You put your hands over your head.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** That gives you plus four AC just covering your face.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:46]** Yeah.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:50]** It's the mental.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:52]** I can't see you.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** So plus one AC.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:54]** That's how that works.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:57]** It is the, let's see, who would hear this?

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** Nico and Rick, I think you would hear this.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** The human pirate, it's her turn.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:08]** And she slowly is like, yes, stay right where you are.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:12]** And then she, you see her pull up this little device.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:17]** It goes beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, and throws a grenade at the two of you.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:19]** I don't like this.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** Oh, yeah, this is good.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:22]** Let's see.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** That is going to be... I have no idea how grenades work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** I haven't gotten to that page yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** That's fine.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:31]** So grenades work by it's AC5 to hit a square, to hit a certain point, right?

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:37]** So basically you roll to make sure that you don't completely, totally fail, of which I did not completely, totally fail.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** And then to make sure you hit that AC5.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:44]** Now, once you do that, there is a certain range that it takes to throw it, and there's a certain...

**[00:27:44 - 00:28:10]** area around it so she is throwing that square uh that grenade right in between the two of you you are directly in front of them about 20 feet she's going to throw it right there so it's a so it's a 15 foot range around you um i think it is you can double check me i'm pretty sure it's a circle around you and the two of you need to give me reflex saves not fair man


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** Not fair.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** You took down Godwina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** That's going to be an 18 for me, John.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:18]** 18.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** I rolled 11.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** This is so good.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:28]** I'm so excited.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** I'm not happy about this.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Oh, I'm very happy about this.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:33]** I don't know why you would not be happy about this.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:33]** It's great.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:34]** It's good stuff.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:38]** So that is going to be... Oh, yeah.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:39]** Oh, right on the money.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:47]** That's going to be three damage to Nico from the frag grenade, six damage to Rick from the frag grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:49]** Total defense did nothing towards a grenade?

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** That's just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:54]** Wait, your roll was an 11 on the reflex save.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** Does the total defense protect?

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:59]** Does it give you a bonus to the reflex save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:59 - 00:28:59]** No, it does not.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:03]** Total defense can't protect you against a grenade.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** That's silly.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** I covered my face.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** I should be fully protected.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** You should be fine.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** I don't know.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:11]** The laws of physics don't apply, Kev.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** The laws of physics, Billy.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** Ghost grenades.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** It's a ghost grenade.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** It is, Rick, your turn.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:20]** What are you going to do now that you have egg all over your face?

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** Egg and grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** Well...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:49]** debating on whether i should do two shots or just one the minus four is a pretty big hit and it's minus four to both right and i will say that um wait did i not show this i think oh i never showed this to you why don't you guys tell me that this was there uh this is that that that like shrapnel and panel that's forming a low barrier in front of them i asked 14 times if i rolled perception on

**[00:29:49 - 00:30:12]** that hallway i told you guys before that there was a like a like a like a set of panels and like stuff and shrapnel and like like stuff that was right in that holding the door open everything john okay well that's there and you like you can reason that that would give them some sort of partial cover interesting that it seems that dr okay could probably go into the hallway up there to maybe


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:40]** get another perhaps I definitely applaud this for not showing you that on roll 20 I thought I had said that earlier that was my bad anyway Rick go ahead given that Rick is gonna say just loud enough for Nico to hear pull back and draw them in and he is going to dart up and around this corner dart up and around what corner oh wow so you just run back you run back towards where the secret entrance is

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:43]** So, yeah, I back away from the door and I run all the way back there.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:49]** And then I'm going to use and I can't take a shot from here, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** I don't think so.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:51]** Okay.

**[00:30:51 - 00:31:00]** You could maybe take a shot, but I'm going to say that she would have cover on the human because you moved so far back and there are enough crates and Nico in between you and where she is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:05]** Then he's actually going to use another move to go up and around to here.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Up and around.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:06]** Oh, okay.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** Wow.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** He's backing up deep into the.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:11]** Deep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** He's in Hail Mary territory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** Yeah.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:14]** All right.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:15]** It is here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:16]** It's your turn.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** Do you want me to roll stuff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** Yeah.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:19]** Give me a stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** Eleven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** Okay.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** Eleven stealth.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:33]** Just like Total Defense, if you crouch and walk on your tiptoes, then you move stealthily.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** Here's what you're doing on your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:38]** They won't be able to see me because I'm behind a big crate.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** They can't see you right now.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:44]** But if I make my own way towards Rick, they shouldn't be able to either, right?

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:48]** This crate should completely block their field of vision for any of my movements.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** I will say that...

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:52]** I'm showing you right now from her square.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:55]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** You would probably be able to stay.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** You can see that arrow coming from where she is.

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:58]** Yeah.

**[00:31:59 - 00:31:59]** Yeah.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:02]** She probably wouldn't be able to see anything from there.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** I don't think the Vesk would be able to either.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:04]** You're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:05]** Okay.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:08]** Here's going to make his way because it's 25 feet.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** So over to Rick.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** Okay.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:14]** And so he will do that.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:15]** Let me move him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** Okay.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:22]** So he steps back past what you now know as the lifeless body of Song, stepping in front of Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:22]** Correct.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:29]** And he will supercharge Rick's weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:34]** Oh, nice!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** Going for the old standard.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** The old gold working.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** Supercharge!

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** You know it works.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** Is that a spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** It is a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:45]** So how many times can you do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:51]** As much as I, well, as many spells as I can cast per day.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:54]** So I can throw it at all of the supercharged weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:58]** You guys haven't had a rest since literally this past evening.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:02]** And you've been in one, two, this is your third combat.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** This was my last spell slot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:05]** Okay.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Yeah, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** I thought we took a 10 minute though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** You did take a little 10 minute thing for stamina points.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** I don't know what that gives you for.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:17]** You're going to have to look and see what, what spell slots that gives you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** Well, I looked for Dr. Okay.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** I got my biohacks back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** So boom.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** Got your biohacks back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:28]** So check Kelly and see if that gives you any spell slots back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** But that would have been from before.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:30]** Okay.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** Good call Kelly.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** Is that your turn?

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** That was pretty awesome.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** That is.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** Is your turn?

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:35]** Yes.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:35]** Round four.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:36]** Nico, it's your turn.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** What are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:44]** So Nico is going to do exactly what Rick suggests and he's going to run all the way back here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:44 - 00:34:13]** dang okay run nice okay i like it i like it uh dr okay what are you doing dr okay is going to um use one of my racial fleets to put some i'm gonna be i'm gonna take a cue seeing the people run okay try to fortify my position what does that mean

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:40]** so i'm going to slime this square oh okay sliming the square and because you're all the way at the north end of the hallway so you're going to slime the square that is right up yeah that's right up against the wall okay in case somebody darts you know around just in case yeah i'm gonna take like a defensive uh position here

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** Okay, so you're going to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:46]** I'm going to say behind those crates, you probably have partial cover for sure.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** Nico, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:54]** And as soon as one of them is in range, I can reveal myself and shoot them, right?

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** If I wanted...

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:01]** Well... That's not delaying an action.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:04]** I'm just... In terms of covering stuff, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:09]** Nothing's going to prevent you from shooting them from where you are now at this moment.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Totally fine.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** So you run, you go back.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:14]** Makes total sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:16]** Made an inky on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:19]** Is that what you said into the comms?

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:21]** No.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:22]** I don't say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** I say that to you.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** Okay.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** To me, the GM.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:27]** Yes.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:28]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** To the fourth wall person.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** To the person at the fourth wall.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** Also the listener.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** Totally fine.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** All right.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** It is the Vess turn.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** Seeing you all run back.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** What is the Vess going to do?

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:47]** Since that door is there, this vest is going to step in.

**[00:35:47 - 00:36:01]** Hears and Rick, you see this vest step around the corner, comes all the way up, stands right in front of Song, and is going to take a shot at Hears.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** Get ready, Hears.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** Oh, he sees us now, yeah.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Lame.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:08]** That...

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:14]** Does a 17 hit you against your KAC?

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** It does not.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** Oh, it doesn't?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:17]** What's your KAC?

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:21]** Well, with the armor I have on, it's 21.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:25]** That is insane.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:25]** Yeah.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:25]** Wow.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** Is it KAC or KAC?

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** That's not my base KAC.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:32]** But with whatever modifications I have for here and that armor.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:34]** That's not the KAC plus 8, right?

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** It is.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** Plus the armor.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** Is that a problem?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:41]** No, the KAC plus 8 is for combat maneuvers, though, so it's just KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:43]** It's just whatever your KAC cell is.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:44]** What?

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** All right, I did not know that.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:47]** Yeah, so it's 13.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:47]** Yeah, it hits.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** Not sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:55 - 00:37:00]** You get hit with four points of damage from this hunting rifle as it hits you.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:02]** Oh, that's good.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:03]** That's good.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:13]** Then, Nico, I'm going to say you can see that the woman also moves over the low barrier.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:26]** and she is going to step up, and she is also going to fire probably at Hears again, following in the steps of the Vesk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** Wow, that was a critical failure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** What is going on with my dice?

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** What weapon is she holding?

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** She is holding a pistol.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:38]** An azimuth laser pistol?

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:42]** It's a tactical semi-auto pistol from what you can see.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** The range is only 30.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** Oh, so I can't hit from there is what you're saying.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** You can't even fire.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Well, I can fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:51]** You can fire and get to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** Oh, yeah, you're right.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** Good call.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** Thanks for calling me out.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:55]** I appreciate it.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** I'm going to not forget that you called me out, but thanks for helping.

**[00:37:59 - 00:37:59]** It just dropped.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:04]** It literally hits the 30-foot barrier like a sheet of air, and then it drops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:06]** Because that's how bullets work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** Yeah, that's exactly how bullets work.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:11]** No, instead of that, she is... Let's see.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:15]** I think she's going to move there and... Hold on.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:19]** She's going to step up...

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:25]** and run next to the Vesk, and use her turn to move instead of shooting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** That is her turn.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Rick, what are you doing?

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:39]** Rick is going to tell Hears, get behind me, and then he is going to open fire on the Vesk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** Okay, open fire on the Vesk.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** Give me your best shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:50]** Ah, that's a six plus seven is a 13.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:55]** For EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:59]** Against EAC on the VESC.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** Yeah, that's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:01]** Yes.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** I was worried I wasted that supercharge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** No.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:05]** Nice job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:07]** That's ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:08]** All right, tell me.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** Give me that damage.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:15]** It's glowing all blue with energy from the supercharge.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** Which weapon is this?

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:19]** Is this your laser rifle?

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:20]** Artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:23]** And it's not a rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** I was wrong by saying that.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** It is a cannon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:30]** It's even more intense.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:30]** It's a rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:33]** It's a kind of rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** That is, yeah.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** So what's the damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** Well, it's a 1d10.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:40]** That's an 8 for that.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** And then it's how many d6s?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** Supercharge is 4d6.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** 4d6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:48]** So go ahead and count these up for me.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:51]** That's a natural 6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** Okay, gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:53]** A five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:54]** Uncalled for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** A six.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:57]** Okay.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:58]** And a five.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** Literally blown back ten feet.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** Done.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** Smack.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:08]** You can see them die instantly as the life leaves their vesk eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:13]** And then Rick glares over at the woman and says, stand down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:18]** And I'll roll intimidation.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:20]** Oh, rolling intimidation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:24]** That's a nine plus three is 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** Nine plus three is 12.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** You are not wrong.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:32]** Whether she stands down or not, that's your game.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** It is.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** Well done, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:42]** I still have a movement, but my question is... The question is, do you need to do everything every round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:47]** You could just run up and get into her face and say, try me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:51]** Well, here's... has initiative before her, right?

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** So I need him to clear out.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:58]** And I'm sorry, I'm flipping through the books to get to the movement section.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** There's no, like, cool movement stuff I could do to, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** I don't think there's any cool movement stuff that you can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:04]** Ah, fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:07]** Not because there's not cool movement stuff, but because you just can't do them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:08]** I know.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:08]** Okay.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** I'll call that my turn then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:10]** Okay.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** I'm just messing with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** Cut all of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** You could crawl five feet as a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:19]** I'm going to go prone.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:22]** You're just going to get prone and just line up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** It's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** Stand down.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:28]** Get on the floor with me.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** Let's just talk about this on the floor.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:32]** Quietly.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** What are you doing with your turn?

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** Rick got on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** He didn't get on the floor.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:44]** Here's takes out his saber and points it at the dead vest and says, if you don't want to end up like him,

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:46]** What do you say we parlay?

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:51]** And does, I believe, a... What would that be?

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:52]** Intimidation?

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** Probably.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Diplomacy, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:57]** I would say diplomacy.

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** Yeah.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:02]** Or I'm going to kill you is intimidation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:04]** Well, it was a seven, so...

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** He's a pirate.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** It's a pirate thing.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** Yeah.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:08]** It's fine.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** It's fine.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:09]** Okay.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Sorry.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:10]** Sorry.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** Fun fact.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:13]** Just reading the core rule book on page 254.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** There are no fun facts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:17]** All sorts of fun facts in this book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** What are you talking about, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** The whole thing is fun facts.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:26]** If you go prone, you take a minus four penalty to melee attacks and front melee attacks.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** Yeah.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:32]** But you get a plus four to your AC against ranged attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:34]** Yeah, go prone is actually pretty cool.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:38]** Just gonna say, I think we should just have a prone party and we'll all just fight while prone.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** Totally cool.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:45]** Here's, what else are you doing besides your parlay diplomacy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:49]** Well, I wouldn't want to attack her, I'm guessing, after that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:51]** It probably wouldn't help your case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:55]** You should also run because you are low on health, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** Or just go prone.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** I'm sorry, I can't explain prone again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:03]** Are you going to turn pro?

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** Just start planking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:07]** Yeah, you just plank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:07]** Plank with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:08]** There's an advantage to this.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:09]** Correct.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:12]** Plus four to AC from ranged weapons.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:15]** Plus four to AC for melee attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:19]** So if she ran up and stabbed you, then she got... Fine stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Oh, my God.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:26]** Here's just going to have his, like, sword ready to defend himself, basically.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:27]** All right.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:34]** Yeah, I mean, you did literally blow the Vesk away with a ridiculous supercharge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:37]** Okay, cool.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** Good talk.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:38]** Round five.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** Nico, what are you doing?

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:43]** So Nico's going to step out from behind the back of this box.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** Yep.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:49]** And he's going to point his azimuth laser blaster over at the last pirate and

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:54]** And he's going to say to her, kindly drop your weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:59]** And engage and parlay with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** Ooh.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:03]** Ooh.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:03]** Ooh.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** Ooh.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:04]** I like it.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:08]** Diplomacy check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Is this a 13 too much?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** Let's find out.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** So that's what you say.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** Best blown back.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** What are you doing on your turn?

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** It's round five.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** You got some people parlaying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:25]** Is going to step up.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:25]** Actually.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:26]** No, Dr. Okay.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:30]** Is going to stay behind cover and stay hidden.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** Hidden.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** Ooh, I like it.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:38]** He's going to move up to the, to the like behind through the slide.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** Okay.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:40 - 00:45:02]** come back to a slime suck it back up and then so be behind so currently rick and here's a nico are on the western wall sort of and dr okay you're staying up to the northeast behind her yeah yeah okay all right the door um and if anyone like i guess full defense

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Right?

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:05]** I can do that.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** You can do total defense as your standard action, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** Okay.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** Total defense, standard action.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** I like it.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** That's your turn.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Okay.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:25]** It's in the middle of round five that she slowly takes her hand off of the sword that she was drawing.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:29]** And she gets... And she just takes her hands.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:31]** She puts them up.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** She doesn't say anything.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:47]** She puts her hands slowly behind her head, and we're moving out of initiative order as she seems to be willing to parlay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Atta girl.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:52]** Nico looks over here.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** She's like, I didn't think that'd work.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:01]** is going to peer into the hallway stealthily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** Give me your stealth check.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:15]** While we're doing that, let's let the listeners know in the middle of the cargo, starboard cargo bay, is this female pirate standing with her hands over her head next to her song.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** They're lifeless, as we know.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:21]** Behind her, one dead Vesk and one unconscious dwarf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:24]** I got a 12 on my stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** It opens.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** You don't see anything in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:33]** Okay.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:33]** Great.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:39]** I'm going to slither and start looting bodies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:43]** That's good.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:48]** Rick, she looks behind you and sees that you're doing that and just...

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** Do you have to just do that so soon?

**[00:46:53 - 00:47:03]** Yeah, I shoot her a look, and I don't even... You know you would make a good starfisher if you're just going to loot my comrades so soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:10]** I'm going to hold up a syringe, and I'll be like, do you need something to relax?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:16]** Nico looks over and hears, and he's like, wait, I've always wanted to try this.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** How does it go?

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:20]** Put up your hands there, lady.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:22]** This is now a parlay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:25]** Did that sound right to yours?

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** That's about right.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:28]** And we are in parlay.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:30]** And then he asks her, like, what are you looking for?

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:32]** You all are fools.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** Oh, yeah?

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** How come?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:40]** You're fools because you think this is all just fun and games.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** We can play pirates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** No one's playing around.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:44]** Your friend is dead.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Your other friend's unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** You sound like you're playing around here.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:51]** Sounds like your friend behind me wants to be a star for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:55]** It appears that you and your crew suck at playing this game.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** Oh, that's what you think.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** That's what you think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:05]** I reckon so far, seeing as though you've given us no reason to actually take you seriously, that this is indeed a game.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:10]** So unless you tell us otherwise, I'm going to take this as a game.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:17]** So, lady here, do you have anything nice to say so that we don't shove you at the nearest airlock?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:19]** Roll a diplomacy check, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:32]** Rick's got his artillery laser still on his shoulder, but he's going to actually take his free hand and reach behind his back and pull out some binders and hand them over to Hears and say, cuff her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:34]** That was a nine total, John, but it was a natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:36]** Yeah.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:39]** Nothing you said gets through to her.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:40]** Here's.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** Here's walks over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:42]** What do you do?

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** Sheaths his sword.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:43]** Okay.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:50]** Goes behind her and starts to cover and says, what are you looking for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** We're looking for everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** I know how you work.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:57]** What's the big cheese you're after?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:02]** Sounds like you, uh, sounds like you know about some big cheese.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** I didn't say anything about a big cheese.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** There always is.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** There always is.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** I know how it works.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** What are you looking for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:11]** This is what we starfishers do.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:19]** We go, we find the ship, we have a transmitter, we show up, and then we take everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** You got everything you've been looking for?

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:23]** Or are you still looking for something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:26]** Her friends were looking for death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:32]** Point to the Osharu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:34]** I'm liking you today, Dr. O.K.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:35]** Thank you.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** You got any more buddies coming?

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:38]** Come on, let's talk.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** Let's talk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:46]** We tracked the chimera into the drift with the help of the shapeshifters.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:50]** There are only three of them.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:54]** What they want, what their motives are, I don't care.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:58]** I just came to take what I want and kill who I want.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:02]** But I don't know if you know this.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:06]** Two of them have been on the ship the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:10]** We are quite aware one of them has been taken out.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** Oh, so then you know that this isn't a game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** Why would you give up that information?

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:15]** I don't know.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:17]** Why would I give up that information?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** No, I was talking to Rick.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:19]** Why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** I'm letting her know that he's dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** That one of them is dead?

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:26]** Why not both of them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:27]** Well, fine.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Say you killed both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** You already said that you killed one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:39]** I said that we killed one of them.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:41]** That is all you need to be known.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** That sounded really funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:46]** I don't know why I said it like that.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:46]** Yeah.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** I think we just rolled it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:50]** You're a dwarf friend over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:53]** What is it that you want to do with me?

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:55]** What is it that you want to know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:55 - 00:51:00]** Nico's going to respond back to her and say, well, let's make a deal.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** What do you want out of this?


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:03]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** Well, I want to live, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:12]** We might consider allowing you to live.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:18]** If you could tell us more about your colleagues here on the vessel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:24]** They did mention some sort of big score.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:27]** And when we came in,

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:42]** We came in through that side airlock, and when we came in, a few of us were going to meet with one of the shapeshifters, and another one just went off in search of the score.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** Which one was that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** Oh, that's Wham.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:46]** What?

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** The rat one?

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:48]** Wham.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** Rat.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:50]** I didn't hear what she said.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:53]** I don't know who you're talking about.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:56]** You're talking like this is an ASMR video.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:58]** I can't understand half of what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:04]** Look, what I do in my own time with the Starfishers is neither yours nor the Starfishers' business.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:06]** I can make ASMR videos if I want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** All right, repeat what you said.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** Who went after the big score?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:13]** Wham went after looking, like we all do.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:20]** We all get a notification from that special transmitter, and then we come on board, and then we take everything.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:25]** And whoever wants to live, lives, and whoever throws up any resistance dies.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:28]** And then we move on to the next ship, and the next ship, and the next ship.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Yeah, we get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** You're a bunch of parasites.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** We get it.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** Where's the big score?

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Do you know where it is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:37]** Takes one to know one, Sheeran.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:41]** You seem like you have experience with this as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** I'm not saying anything about that.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Where's the big score?

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** Where is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** I don't know where it is.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** You would know.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** You're the ones who are here.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** I just want to leave.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:56]** Let me leave and I'll wait in the forward airlock where we're supposed to leave from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Hold on.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:58]** Hold on.

**[00:52:59 - 00:52:59]** Which airlock?

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** My friends and I have an issue here.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:13]** If we let you go, what's to stop you from taking your comm, comming your friends and telling them exactly where we are and laying a big ambush?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:24]** I'm willing to, and I believe all of us are, and he looks around like trying to get confirmation here, open to the idea of letting you live.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:33]** That being said, we need a little bit more information and we need a way to make sure you don't interfere

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:37]** With this ship getting back on course to Absalom Station.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** Because I'll tell you one thing.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:42]** I'm not going to end up as a hostage.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** And this ship's not going to get looted.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:48]** Not until I find out what's valuable on it first.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** And he winks and gives her a smile.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:55]** So tell me how you'd like us to keep you quiet.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** And how we can trust you.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:04]** or how we can make sure we can, how we can make sure we can trust that you aren't going to get in our way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:09]** It sounds like at least two of you would make good fits for the starfishers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** Hey, let's not get to insults here yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** Osharu and you.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:18]** One of you already is some sort of pirate, it seems.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** At least it's familiar with our ways.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:24]** Look, why don't I give you my weapons?

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** I'll give you my communicator.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:32]** You can tie me up, whatever you need to do, and then just let me leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:38]** I'll board the ship whenever... You will be leaving in the custody of the stewards when they arrive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:43]** Oh, so you're saying that I have no choice and this whole thing has been for naught.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** Hold on.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** Hold on.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:49]** Rick is going to start cuffing the... She smiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:52]** I didn't say anything about this.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** Hold on.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** She smiles.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:56]** Hold on.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** I don't think that's going to work for my friend here.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:16]** Though I do believe there is a situation where we can report her dead if she in turn turns on her pirate friends for the grand score, the big cheese of her life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:19]** I am not interested in being a part of this piracy.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:24]** And Rick is going to start cuffing the gnome.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** Don't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** Don't do it, Rick.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:28]** Let's see if she flips.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** Let's cuff the unconscious dwarf.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:33]** She has her hands over her head.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:34]** Nico hears.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:36]** You had already put cuffs on her, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:36]** Yeah, she's cuffed.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:38]** She's cuffed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:43]** Should I roll a diplomacy check to see if she's willing to turncoat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:51]** You can, but I'm going to say that she doesn't say anything because she senses that you all are not a unified front.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:56]** Rick, she will be far more valuable to us.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:59]** Which is fine, because we can use that to our advantage, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:08]** Let's just pretend... Well, I shouldn't metagame, so... Rick, she will be far more valuable to us.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** That's okay.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** She'll be far more valuable as a turncoat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:20]** Perhaps we might get to the bottom of this if we, at least for now, cooperate with...

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:23]** What she's planned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:27]** I know I'm certainly willing to take a chance here.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:30]** That being said, please do not test our forbearance.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:35]** We will space you if you decide to turn on us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:39]** I can make you relax for a very long time.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** Trust me, I've watched him do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** It's kind of funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:51]** So to be clear, you two are asking her to go along with the plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:58]** You're saying you'll just keep her alive and just... We'll keep her alive so long as she turns on her allies and lets us know what the plan is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:14]** and participates gives us the heads up and we can all split the score together wink wink I don't actually buy into this but I think it's a good idea I don't know where I don't know why I'm still putting my hands on my head although presumably hers are behind her cuffed I don't


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:21]** know where Wham went and where the others and where the shapeshifter that was aboard was coming.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:29]** We were just on the lookout for passengers like yourselves to make sure that nothing would happen.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:32]** So we've been on this starboard side.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:34]** Do you know where they were headed?

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:35]** No, I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:39]** What did this shapeshifter that met you?

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** Who are these?

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** What did he look like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:47]** I believe that they are called astrozoans.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:48]** Octopi.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:53]** Octopi, yeah, but who is this astrozoan?

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:57]** That's a technical term that's argued by a lot of scholars, so I don't know that we can agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:59]** But we could have that conversation too if you want.

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:02]** Tomato, tomato, octopi, octopi, octopu.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:02]** I don't care.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** Just tell me what I need to know.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:06]** Look right here in my face, please.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** What did this astropi look like?

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:12]** Was he in a shapeshifter form or was he in his octopi form?

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:14]** Have you seen an astrozoan?

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:21]** Was this astrozoan in his form or was he in his cloaked form or his undercover form?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:23]** They were just in their normal form.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:26]** I don't know where they went or what form they may have taken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:33]** Do you know if they meant to take over positions within the crew?

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:39]** Or if they were coming aboard as passengers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** I'm not sure.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:47]** They left for Legacy Station before we were separate.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:49]** So they left our ship.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:51]** Do you know their names?

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:51]** Yes.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:52]** Yes.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:58]** It seems like if I tell you their names and if I keep telling you, you're going to let me live.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:02]** So I do hope that you follow through on this.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** You're catching on.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:05]** But I just warn you...

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** These are not people to be trifled with.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:09]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** I'll be the judge of that.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:14]** I thought we were done with the warnings.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:18]** I thought we made ours fairly clear to you as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** Oh, I'm making it clear to you.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** That's all I have to say.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:27]** Their names are Yox and Cub.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:27]** We already knew that.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:35]** And at that moment, from behind her, on her wrist as well, you hear the familiar of a comm coming in.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:40]** And you hear the sounds of like... Like the struggle happening.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:44]** And there's a brief... Help!

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:45]** Please!

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:49]** Just... Come to... Gym...

**[00:59:49 - 01:00:03]** And then from below you to the south, you hear the familiar, unmistakable sound of something hitting the wall from whatever room is next besides the cargo bay.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** And that is our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:11]** We never asked if... We already knew the names?

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:12]** Yes, we already knew the names.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** Oh, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:18]** I think... We need to ask if the...

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:24]** hobgoblins are related to the starfishers yeah we should ask that you can always ask that next time


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:30]** Hey everyone, it's Tears.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:41]** I gotta say, Rick19 has been on and on and on and on about how supposedly myself and some others have been playing fast and loose with lives like we're some kind of psychos just to draw attention away from himself.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:46]** Today, I proposed parlay, and we were able to get some information and some cooperation.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:49]** So I'm not some kind of bloodthirsty thug, okay?

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:58]** Now, obviously I know from personal experience that you can't always trust the word of pirates, but I also know that they will work with you if there is something in it for them.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:00]** But how would you handle this situation if you were playing?

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:05]** Would getting information or trying to conscript her be worth the risk that she might stab you in the back later?

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** You should let us know.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:12]** Thanks as always, you scallywags, and see you next We'll Save Wednesday.
