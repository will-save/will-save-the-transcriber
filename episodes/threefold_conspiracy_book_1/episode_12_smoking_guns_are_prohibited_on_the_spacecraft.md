## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Last time on Willsave.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:08]** Tempers fly as uncertainty grips the occupants of the ship.

**[00:00:09 - 00:00:11]** Rick-19 and Dr. O.K.

**[00:00:12 - 00:00:16]** engage in some aggressive dialogue with first mate Lozu.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:22]** However, thanks to the smooth talking of Niko Orion, our group receives a lead.

**[00:00:23 - 00:00:26]** The key card to Algiata's room.

**[00:00:26 - 00:00:32]** However, more questions arise when Trostenek emerges from the cargo hold with a startling accusation.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:35]** Keith Cadenz is behind the recent events.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:41]** The final shock happens when a random tail ring is found in the workout facility.

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:44]** What new clues will our adventurers discover?

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on Willsafe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** Kev, can you hear this?

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:42]** Yes.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:44]** Okay.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:47]** Because I was worried because you always ask to lower the music.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** That's not true.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** You can totally hear me because you responded to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** But I feel like focus really hard to hear it.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:54]** I think the music is louder than you this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** Thank you.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:55]** What?

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** We did this whole setup.

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:01]** We talked about it before we started recording.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:04]** And then now Kelly just went back on the joke.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** So, okay.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** I'm going to lower it a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** John is literally swearing at everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** Yeah, I'm definitely swearing.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:17]** But Kev, I think it's a good opportunity to talk about... Hearing loss and how you should take care of yourself.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** No, it's true.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** You really should.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:22]** I mean, we're all wearing headphones.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Insert endorsement here.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** It's a PSA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:35]** I know, and that's the problem, is wearing the headphones, I have to crank my volume all the way up in order to hear John over the music, and then that makes my ears even worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:42]** Look, the acoustics consultant in me is like, seriously, you should be very concerned about noise.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:45]** It can definitely affect health, and it's very important.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:48]** So that's just my little PSA.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** Are you purposely like stepping away from your microphone?

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** Yeah, I can actually barely hear you.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:56]** Are you joking?

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** Kevin, you should take care of your ears.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:00]** This is how you can listen better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** Ask your friends to speak louder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:04]** This is a quick little public service announcement.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** Hearing is very important for your health.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:11]** Making sure that you don't get tendonitis is something that you definitely want to make sure you do.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** Are you guys doing ASMR?

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:18]** Guys, this is also the Nick Fletcher ASMR podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:18]** Okay, wait, wait.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Hey, guys, how we doing?

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:22]** We're playing Magic Missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:24]** Okay, I'm going to raise my level.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:27]** Questionable whether we'll keep all this raising levels in there.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** Could be good.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** Sometimes it's fun, sometimes it's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:32]** Questionable whether or not...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:57]** we even play today wow whoa whoa you got plans for something else i mean hey okay i mean that that's cool if you want to it's fine it's been too long i've i feel what are you talking about it's only been a week i don't know what you're talking about we definitely don't only been yeah it's just two weeks no it's been a week one there's no way that we record every week at that time yeah

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:57]** That's it.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:59]** There's no way that we don't do that.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** We don't have personal lives.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** We don't abscond to Hawaii.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Who does that?

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** That looks fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:16]** Do you want to drop a fun Hawaii fact before we move on to something related?

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** I'm giving you the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** Yeah, so where did you go, Will?

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** What island?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** I just went to Oahu.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** Oh, just Oahu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** What part of Oahu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:27]** I'm sorry, that should be funny, but it is.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:28]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:33]** We're all asking, Will, what island did you go to expecting some exotic answer?

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:37]** And he's just like, I just went to Oahu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:41]** Actually, it was like a legitimate question because I've been to multiple islands in Hawaii.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:44]** No, Kev, I know it's a legitimate question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** Kev, we know that you were on a submarine.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** We have not forgotten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** I lived under Hawaii for three years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:53]** I'm sure the water is really nice in Hawaii, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:54]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** It's beautiful.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** I used to go surfing on Christmas Day.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:57]** It was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** That sounds amazing.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** That is nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:00]** So, wait.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** Where in Oahu were you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:03]** I was in Waikiki.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** Okay.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** Cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:12]** Most of my time, I lived in Aiea Heights, which is just northwest of Pearl Harbor.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** But I lived in Waikiki for a little while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:23]** I think the real takeaway from this is any listeners in Hawaii, invite us out to your local game store.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:26]** And we would love to come out and just do a live show.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** That would just be awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:33]** We could reminisce about Kevin's Navy time and I can drink Mai Tais.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:36]** Yeah, that sounds great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:38]** That was really great wordplay there, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** I like it.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** That was good wordplay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]** Do I get a... That's not punny, I guess.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** Is that a punishment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:48]** There's nothing about that that's a punishment, I don't think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:50]** It's so hard to come up with good puns, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:52]** I'm just saying, the burden is on you.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** That's why it's a worthy goal.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:56]** It's a worthy goal.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** All right, I got a real question.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:02]** Real, real tough question that I've been stewing over.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** Like, day-long stewing over.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Here's the question.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:12]** We haven't really talked about our classes at all.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** I feel like we've had this conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:16]** When?

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** When did we have it?

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** I don't know.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:20]** I feel like we have discussed some of this.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** But on air, though?

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:26]** For the listeners, how long do we want to keep the audience in the dark?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** It's dropped from time to time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** We certainly didn't introduce it at the beginning.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:31]** But yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** I'm just going to openly lie to you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** I am a Technomancer.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** He is a Technomancer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:45]** Which is a blend of magic and technology in this world.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** And yeah, he's kind of cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** Yeah, Technomancers are really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** Yeah, they are really awesome.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:57]** It's good for like magic hacking things and just doing spells much like what you would find in D&D.

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:00]** In fact, some of the spells are the same as those that were in D&D, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:03]** Notably your favorite, Magic Missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** Notably my ultimate favorite.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** What's D&D?

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:09]** Obviously, I don't even know what that game is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** Yes, who knows?

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** One wonders.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:14]** Does anyone else want to share their class?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** No.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** I'll share mine.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** Okay.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** And a future plan here, too.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:20]** Okay.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:31]** Nico is an envoy business, but at level two, he will be multi-classing into the operative class as well.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:34]** So he will be an envoy operative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** That's pretty sweet.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:36]** Okay.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** Yeah.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** What?

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:44]** Why are you so... I just like... I guess you could be that.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:45]** No, I don't.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:50]** I'm not digging on your choice, Nick.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:54]** More so of, you know, like, we haven't even gotten to level two.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:57]** What if, like, Miko dies before level two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** Oh, that's a good point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:20]** i mean if i don't make it if if i don't make it then i don't make it right but i mean i mean i hope i do but that is my intention i mean only okay plans to multi-class also but he will keep that to himself for the gonna sit on it okay currently he's biohacker though most definitely


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** Ah, Biohacker.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:23]** That's the newer one, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:29]** That's from the new character operations manual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** Yep, those three new classes.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** Witchwarper, Biohacker, Vanguard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:37]** I played Witchwarper in our test play, and Witchwarper was a lot of fun.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:42]** So I think that'd be a good mix for somebody to mix into at some point if they want.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** There's some really neat abilities there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** Yeah.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** You can do a lot as a Witch Warper.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:54]** It reminds me, for anybody out there who have heard of a game called D&D, it reminds me of the 3.5 edition.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:56]** There was a class called the Chaos Mage.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** Kind of reminds me of that.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** That's what Witch Warper kind of reminds me of.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** It's pretty cool.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** Sounds cool.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:08]** As for Rick, Rick is a soldier with a hunter subclass.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:16]** And that rolls right into his bounty hunting skills for the android abolitionist front.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** That's pretty cool.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** Interesting.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** Yeah.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:27]** I was debating on their sharpshooter, and then there's another one that they, I think, were test playing, which was like a gunslinger or something.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:28]** Gun dancer.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Pistol dancer?

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:49]** pistol dancer yeah that one had was fun too but i i couldn't find it on hero forge or hero lab um and so i just didn't want to like have to modify because it's the first first time playing through a character so i didn't want to think all right it's good to be about that time


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:53]** When we start playing, getting to the good stuff.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** I see Kelly yawning.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** And you know what?

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** We all got to get that energy up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:02]** He was shouting at all his excitements but doing it silently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** Hey, you know what?

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:06]** I'm not here to try and match the crew.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:09]** And that's that we need to pull in some energy.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:11]** Just up the ante.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** I have no solution for how to do that.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** I'm just saying.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:18]** Let's go to...

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** The recap.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** Not the map.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:23]** But if you're on roll 20, that will come up.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** So here's the thing.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:30]** As we're kind of... How was the music, y'all?

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:31]** Super great.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:32]** It's pretty good.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** Okay.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:38]** You walk into the gym.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** After all...

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** That has happened before.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:48]** You have gone and investigated the cargo hold.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:52]** You have found Trostenec unconscious.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:55]** You battled an incapacitator robot.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:59]** You locked Trostenec up in a cargo crate.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:04]** You got Lozu, the first mate, to go handle him.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:06]** And...

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:15]** As he's leaving, he shouts to Rick with another name of a crew member.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:29]** Now, you all decide to, you get permission, let's call it, from the first mate to explore a little further in your investigation.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:36]** And you start looking around and you start looking in the gym.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:39]** As you go in the gym, Dr. O.K.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:43]** is looking around, trying to see what he can find.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:49]** And we jump to the map here on roll 20.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** Thank you, roll 20.

**[00:11:52 - 00:12:01]** You do find, as we ended last time, what seems to be a traditional Yosuke tail ring.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** So as Dr. O.K.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** is standing...

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:25]** over this ornate piece of jewelry to the left the doors to the gym open and in come running four skittering space goblins

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:27]** One runs over to the hot tub.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:30]** Two run towards the pool.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:35]** One starts running towards kind of the exercise equipment near where you are, Dr. OK.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:39]** And the two running towards the pool, they start kind of pushing each other.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:42]** They fall on the mat, start wrestling.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:55]** And then before the door closes, behind them in walks the unmistakable figure of a hobgoblin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:58]** What do you all do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:05]** Uh, Rick and, and here's, and Nico are still in the hallway with the doors closed.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** There's a window in the door, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:11]** I think I mentioned before that there's like a little window where you can like see in.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:17]** So like we had just peered like looking into it before we go charging in and we see this.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:26]** Um, so he's going to pause for a second and roll perception to see if he can recognize like, is this an aggressive move or are they just running in and messing around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:27]** Give me a perception roll.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** Uh, real low, because Rick... Let's see.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:33]** It's my... Uh... Eight.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:33]** Eight.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** Eight points of perceptions.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** Nico will roll perception, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:41]** Eight points of perception damage.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:44]** Here's rolled 17.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** 17 perception damage from Kelly.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** What about you?

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** Nico rolled three.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** Three points of perception damage from Nico.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** rolled a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** Yeah, so that makes sense.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:58]** Because Dr.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** O.K., you're in there.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:05]** And it really seems like the Hobgoblin has a towel over her shoulder.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:11]** It seems like they're all just starting to run in as if to spend time here in the gym.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** Not necessarily to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:36]** attack there's no aggressive emotion um did we i grabbed besides dr okay i grabbed the ring thing yeah but sorry go ahead here i was gonna say did we also see that something happened in the water or just dr okay

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:41]** Because remember, something was in the water, like trickled or rippled or something like that, right?

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:44]** And then we saw the tail ring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** I don't think there was anything in the water.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:51]** I think Kev mentioned being like, I'm really worried that something's going to leap out of the water, which is, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:53]** You made a comment about the pool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** I don't know.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** I was just talking about the pool.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:56]** I remember something like that.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** It's just a good pool.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** Hey, when you see a good pool, you see a good pool.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** That's it, you know?

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** A good pool should make you want to get in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:03]** One of these goblins is going to just die instantly when something comes out of that water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:04]** All right.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** So they start running in.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:06]** Dr.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** O.K., you said that you want to hide.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** What?

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** No.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:16]** You want to put away the Yosuke tail ring?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** Yes.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:21]** I was wondering if I picked it up because I see it on Roll20.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** I thought I picked it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:23]** You did pick it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:25]** Yeah.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:32]** I just had it here on Roll20 so that way you could see where it was, but it's now in your inventory, so I will move it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:37]** I say to the goblins, getting a good workout, are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:41]** What are you saying?

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:45]** I don't... Why are you talking to me?

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** Why are you talking to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** The one nearest you says.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** What did he say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** Why are you talking to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:55]** Politeness.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:55]** Bye!

**[00:15:55 - 00:16:05]** And just starts running near to one of the machines in the back and just starts to kind of use them and very quickly like... Clearly doesn't know how to work out, just doing whatever.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** Except the one in the hot tub is clearly chilling.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** That one knows what it's doing.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:15]** The other two are just wrestling on the mat and immediately following that goblin running away.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:20]** Then the hobgoblin starts to walk over towards the pool and looks at you.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** Doctor, okay?

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** Just nods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:28]** I tip my head to him, you know, just to acknowledge him.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** She tips her head back to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:32]** Her.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:33]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** What a polite goblin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:37]** And then she keeps walking.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:39]** What are you all doing out in the hall?

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** Oh, Dr. Okay, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** Here's... Yes, Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:46]** I'll roll a stealth to see, like, I'm going to duck down so that nobody sees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:47]** Okay.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:48]** So let's go one by one.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:49]** Go in.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Okay, so here's going to go in.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** Rick's going to roll stealth.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** Nico, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** Why are you guys trying to hide?

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** And I'm going to look at the pool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** I don't trust these things.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:04]** Nico's going to stand out in the hall a little while longer and watch through the porthole.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** Okay.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:10]** And just kind of watch how things kind of unfold a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:12]** So Rick rolled a 19 for stealth.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:16]** So as soon as the doors start opening for Hughes, he ducks back.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:19]** And when the doors close, he's going to peek his head back up and launch through the window.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:19]** Okay.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:21]** But he's going to have his pistol ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:22]** Okay.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** So his hands on his pistol.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:28]** Hughes is going to roll perception on the pool in front of him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** Okay, so you walk in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:33]** A giant tentacle splashes out of the water and grabs you by the face.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:33]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** It's 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:37]** 20 perception damage to the pool.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** That's very damaged.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:43]** Yeah, it's a lot of perception damage to the pool.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** It looks mostly clean.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:54]** Maybe it seems like every once in a while they missed a tablet for chlorine or whatever they're using.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** But it looks fine.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:58]** You don't see anything in it.

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:58]** All right.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** Here's walks over to the other pool then.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:00]** Okay.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** So you start walking over.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Yes.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:08]** The space goblin in the hot tub doesn't even care or notice you.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:10]** Just keeps its eyes closed.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:12]** Just head back in the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** That's fine with me.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** Relaxed.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** Can I roll perception on that then?

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:16]** Yes.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:16]** That pool as well?

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** Yeah.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** I got a 17.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:20]** Wow.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:23]** These pools aren't going to last long with all this perception damage.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** They just evaporate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** Wait, John, real quick.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** Why are you calling it perception damage?

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:29]** It's a joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** It's a joke.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** Because it's a new rule from Paizo.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:37]** They just came out and said all perception deals damage.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:40]** It deals confidence damage.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** Confidence radiation damage.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** Nice.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** I got Nick.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:46]** That's good.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:48]** Dr. K, were you going to say something?

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** You seem like you were about to say something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:50]** No?

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:54]** Good afternoon.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:58]** What would be a greeting for this time of day?

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:00]** I don't even know what time of day it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:03]** Yeah, it's like a little after lunch.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:06]** I think we talked about before that it was around noon now.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:09]** It's about noon-ish on the second day, early afternoon on the second day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:20]** From experience, days and nights on ships that don't have any kind of reference to day or night are mandated by a light schedule.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:25]** So in the evening, they would turn on red lights, and in the day, they would turn on white lights.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:30]** But question here was the ship is out of power and everything is an emergency light still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:52]** correct yeah they've you can tell that the that the lighting system does seem to be mostly running on this like uh lavender kind of light purple emergency lighting um all the other systems for life like all the life support and all like the heating and stuff that all is is fine and is working


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:55]** I have a question for Rick in the Hall.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:57]** What is this door here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** Rick in the Hall.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:02]** You would... You don't know at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:05]** Well, because one of these doors led to the stairwell.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:07]** That's what we took to get up or down...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** So looking down the hall – A few episodes ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** Go back and listen to that for you listeners.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** If you haven't listened, why are you listening to this episode?

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:14]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:18]** and Rick went on an explorative whatever.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** Explorative expedition.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:20]** Yeah.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:25]** So about – I would say you're at the part of the hall that splits off –

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** Behind you is going to the cargo hold.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** In front of you is what?

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** That's maybe like 60 to 80 feet.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:38]** About halfway down on your left, this opening here are those stairs that go between levels.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:40]** So you're not quite sure what's behind that door.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** This is the kitchen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:44]** The first door on the right is the kitchen.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:46]** The next door down is the dining hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** Yeah, and then it turns a corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:53]** So this door here, can I not see any kind of label for it or –


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:59]** You can't see one from there, and there doesn't seem to be, like, a hole that you can look through to see what's in there.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** Dr. O'Kay, you were talking.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:05]** You were curious about what to say to the Hobgoblin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:05]** Uh, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:11]** Good afternoon, um... person.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** I don't know their name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:15]** Then ask them.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:15]** Hello.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:19]** What is your name, miss?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:22]** I thought that we met before, but, uh...

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Jinterloga.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** That's my name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** Interloger?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:29]** What?

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:31]** Jinterloga.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** Ooh.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:34]** With a J. Pleasure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:38]** She doesn't stop, you know, kind of getting ready to get in the pool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** Hmm.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** The pool is splendid.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:47]** What do you think of this emergency here that we have?


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:49]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:53]** Inconvenient, I would say.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** Yes.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:59]** But as long as we get there, it doesn't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** Yes.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** Okay.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** I don't know.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:12]** I don't want to provoke an attack or insult this person.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:14]** Uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:17]** Is there something that you need?

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** Any attack on an aim is an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:29]** Any thoughts as to the cause of this disruption?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:32]** I have the same amount of ideas that you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** You have seven ideas?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:36 - 00:23:06]** yes I'm holding a number behind my back that's how many ideas I have you can guess no she's she basically is like I don't know what caused this emergency and I don't know what caused the disappearance of the security chief but again she was weak it does have no matter as long as we get there she starts to slide into the pool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:10]** Well, I'll leave you to your soak then.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:11]** Enjoy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:19]** Just casually waves her hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** No one got the in-laws reference?

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** Nope.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:28]** That was Nick, everybody, for keeping score at home.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** So what do you all do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:35]** What are your thoughts right now?

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Niko is outside.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:41]** He wants this to play out a little bit, but he wants to enter at the right time.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:45]** So he knows that there's a situation already in the room.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:49]** He doesn't want to enter prematurely and set things off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:49]** Yeah.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:52]** He probably can't hear what's going on, per se.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:54]** He can't hear what they're saying, but you can see them talking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:03]** He knows that these are the same space goblins that were causing a ruckus in the cafeteria.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:03]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:07]** This does appear to be the same crew.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:10]** And that there was the standoff with songs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:17]** Yes, that song is a troublesome faux android, whatever he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:20]** You say this to Junshiroga?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:26]** No, I was just remarking out loud, but I forgot that that's what happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:26]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:31]** shouts into the gym, that song character should put salt in my food.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:40]** Rick is going to look at Nico and tell him, get them out of there without causing a scene.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:42]** I'm going to go down this hall and explore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:46]** Well, I was kind of on my way out anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:50]** Okay, well, I mean, so Dr. K, you start walking out.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** Rick, you don't see this.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** Nico, you see this.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:55]** Here's what are you doing in the corner before we see what happens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:59]** I'm guessing my perception roll didn't turn anything up then, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** Ah, yes.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:03]** No, the hot tub, you can't really tell too much.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** It just looks like a really bubbly hot tub.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:07]** Like the jets work great.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:10]** They were not affected by the power outage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** Sounds nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:11]** Yeah.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:15]** So if you want some of that lumbar help, this is the hot tub.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:18]** Best hot tub this side of the packed worlds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:27]** Here's doesn't know that we're supposed to be being led out, but he does want to find that, really wants to find that relic.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:30]** So he will start to head that direction anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** Okay.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** So he starts to walk out.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** Dr. K starts to walk out.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** You guys are walking out.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** What's Nico, Rick?

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:39]** Rick, you start heading down the hall.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:44]** I'm going to go look at this door and see if there's any kind of markings on it.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:47]** And then if not, I'm going to try to stealthily open it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** Okay.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** And Nico, go ahead.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:50]** Sorry, you were saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:50 - 00:26:03]** So as Rick started walking away before they started walking out, before he started noticing that Dr. O'Kane here is walking out, he just kind of mutters to himself, do I look like a babysitter?

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:08]** And then as he looks out, he's just like, well, that makes my job easy.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:13]** Yeah, you don't need to do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:13]** You're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:16]** Yeah, Rick doesn't even wait for Nico to talk.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** He just turns and starts walking towards that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:22]** Are we going to investigate downstairs?

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** I say to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:25]** Rick.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** So a couple things.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:27]** Yeah.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** Let's see.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** What did Lozu tell you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:36]** Lozu told you... She gave us a key to Algiada's room and asked us to go investigate Algiada's disappearance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:39]** She gave me the key to go for Algiada's room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:39]** Us.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:39]** Us.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:41]** Us as a group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** We are a team.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:48]** Yeah, and then she also called Keeve and was like, they're going to come help you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:51]** Do we know where her room is?

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** Like, is there a map on the ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:54 - 00:27:03]** There's not a map, but you would just know, I would say from just your time, that likely it's in the next level up would be her room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** Like the cruise quarters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** Yeah, cruise quarters.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** How do we get there?

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:08]** The staircase?

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** Those same ladders that you took to go down.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Oh, okay.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** Yeah, those also go up.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** Let's go there.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:17]** Real quick, Rick, you were going to look at the door, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** Yes.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** So do you want me to roll perception?

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:22]** Yeah, you can roll perception.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:22]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:25]** Nine.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:29]** Nine points of perception damage.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:31]** Nine points of perception damage on the door.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** 21.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** Oh, you're also looking?

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** Okay.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** This door just exploded.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** So I'll say this.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:45]** It does seem like the door is meant to be – it is intended to be shut.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** It is not meant to be easily opened.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:52]** It seems like a Starfinder equivalent of a heavy door.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** It seems like there are a lot of protocols to keep it shut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:58]** Like it's a door to the exterior type heavy door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:59 - 00:27:59]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:04]** It's just a closet, like a supply closet that's locked shut?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** I didn't say it was a spy closet.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:12]** I'm just saying it seems like it is a door that is meant to be shut or it is meant to be opened only in one certain way.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:13]** So if you want to try to open it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** Rick's just going to move on.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:14]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:15]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** You don't want to talk.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** Rick is going to recognize it.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:17]** Go ahead, Rick.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:26]** Rick is going to just recognize that this door is not necessarily important to us and start heading down the hall.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** But he'll turn back if you guys start to do something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:35]** I mean, here's is probably going to, can I know like if it's, it's not opening to the outside, I'm guessing.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** So it's probably safe to open.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:40]** Can I sense if there's any sort of danger in opening it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:44]** With your 21, you know that there's not danger to opening it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:45]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** Not in the sense of, like, traps or anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** Sweet.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:53]** So, Here's is going to try to hack it and see if he can open it up.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:58]** And maybe a certain charming gentleman can help me do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Nico can certainly help out with that.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:05]** Nico's going to look on at what Here's is doing, and he's just going to be like, you're trying to hack it.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:06]** Nice.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:06]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** Yeah.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:15]** In spite of the fact that I have plus eight computers, I did roll an 11 only, so I probably will need some assistance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:18]** Okay, so an 11, and then you were aiding?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** Yes, I am.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:22]** So that's over a 10 for me, so I succeed on the 8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** So 13, yeah.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:30]** It doesn't seem like you can hack in to this particular door with a 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Well, snap.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** He just grumbles to himself.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:42]** Starts walking next to Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:47]** I think we should go investigate El Giotto's quarters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** I concur.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:50]** I agree.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** Okay.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:57]** So then Rick is going to head to the stairwell and kind of peek into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:59]** I will reveal the stairwell.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** Here you guys go.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:02]** Okay.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:02]** Boom.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** So you're walking down.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** You go up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** I shout, up ladder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:13]** Is that what you shout when you're on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:19]** Yeah, because if it's only a single ladder well, you would shout either up or down ladder to tell the people.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** So there's a single up ladder and a single down ladder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:23]** Yeah, I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:30]** Yeah, so you would shout whatever direction you're going so that people coming in the opposite direction would know not to come down on you.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:34]** Is that like a submarine thing that you learned in the Navy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:37]** It's a general shipboard ladder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:38]** Oh, okay.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** Just Navy things?

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** Yeah, just those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:44]** Just Navy stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:57]** So if you guys scroll on the map over to the left, you will see the upward part of the upper deck.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** Are you transporting us?

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** Left, you say?

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:01]** To the left, yes.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** I just revealed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:05]** I don't see anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** I see black.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:10]** Well, you should zoom out and see where I am.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:11]** I have done that.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:11]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** You just sounded up.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** I see where you are.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:14]** Lower left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Yes, lower left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** Is that what it is?

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:19]** Oh, that?

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:19]** Wow.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:21]** Yeah, that's a little black spot.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:23]** That's a little spot in the middle of nowhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:24]** Yeah.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:28]** I like maps that have, like, different levels all on the same maps.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** That way you don't have to change maps.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** It's cool.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:30]** It's good.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** So you all come.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:34]** You step into the hall here.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** It looks pretty similar.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:41]** The hallway splits to the left and to the right.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:47]** And it looks very similar to the hallway that's on the mid deck on the passenger deck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:55]** Is there any kind of markings that say any kind of directions, you know, rooms this way, bridge that way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:55 - 00:32:07]** There is a wayfinding that shows the bridge to the right, and then to the left and to the right it just says cruise quarters.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:08]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:16]** So Rick is going to start heading left, almost like he knows the way, and so he's going to skirt the wall until the edge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:18]** Hughes will go with him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:25]** Nico's going to look both ways when he comes out the ladder, and then he's going to follow everybody else.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:27]** He's kind of shrugging to himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:34]** I'm going to stay in the sort of close to the rear of the group, looking around, rolling perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** Okay.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:40]** I'm going to roll perception around the corner, see if I see anything.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:41]** 17.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** 14, or 18, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** Okay.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** So, Dr.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:51]** O.K., you're rolling perception on the corridor, and Rick, you're rolling perception around the corner?

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:52]** Right?

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:53]** Yes.

**[00:32:54 - 00:33:01]** Okay.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:04]** I'm just going to be quiet for a minute because I think it put you guys on it.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:14]** So in the corner in front of you, Dr.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:28]** O.K., that kind of black quarter of a sphere that you see, you can tell that's just part of the bulkhead, the architecture of the ship and how they kind of set it up just extends into the hallway.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:31]** And you start following it.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** You're like, oh, that's interesting.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:35]** You're just noting like this type of starship.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:39]** You start following down to...

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:45]** The left, watching the wall, absentmindedly.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:49]** As this is happening, Rick, you take a peek around the hall.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:52]** The hall looks to be mostly the same.

**[00:33:52 - 00:34:00]** You see about in the middle, there is a set of doors on your left and then another hallway going off to your right.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:04]** And you kind of think this feels a little similar to the passenger deck, right?

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:08]** Like the compartments are based off of a center hallway.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** You're like, that's probably similar here.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** And it's at that time that Dr.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:17]** O.K., you are looking and it just seems weird.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:23]** One of the panels on the wall, it just seems like it has had a place.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:30]** Maybe the color of the wall is a little darker.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** It's almost like imperceptible.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:34]** This is Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:39]** But this is like Nintendo level, like this is where you would place the bomb in order to open up a secret room type?


## Speaker_0

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** No, it's just kind of a thought.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:46]** And then maybe, I don't know, maybe you run your hand on it.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** It feels the same.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** It just looks like a little odd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:57]** Can I take a look and investigate closer the panel?

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** Is it like a computers or engineering?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:01]** Yeah.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** You know, I'm going to say give me another perception check.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** Natural 20.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** Holy cow.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** Well done.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** We lost Nick.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** Nick is too scared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** No.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:13]** I'm still here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:15]** Okay.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:19]** Show me something, GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:21]** So, you're running...

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:24]** Maybe your hand along it.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:30]** Your hand kind of touches the seam of where that panel connects to another panel.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:34]** And I'm picturing that it kind of extrudes from the wall a little bit, right?

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** And it like curves, right?

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:40]** You kind of follow your hand into that little valley, into that little divot.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:46]** And as you do, it brushes by some text.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:49]** And you're like, oh, yeah, it's probably part number.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** I don't know.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** Just like manufacturer.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:55]** But then the text is weird.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:59]** It doesn't seem like any manufacturer or part number that you've seen.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** It says... Is it a bomb?

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** Star Dream 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** Star Dream 2?

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:13]** Can I do like a... In like very small text, it says Star Dream 2.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** You could do a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** Yeah.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:17]** Okay.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:19]** Nico's going to do a culture check as well on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:25]** So this is like, it's a different panel than what all the other panels are, and that's where it says it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:29]** Yeah, it's not, like, it totally looks like it's fine.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:31]** It totally looks like it's okay.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** Like, it doesn't look part of the ship, though, right?

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:40]** But it only took you getting a good perception check and, like, thinking about it for a second, being like, huh, that's a little weird.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:43]** Well, I rolled a 20 on my culture check.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** Impressive.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** I got a 21.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** You got a 21?

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:46]** I got a 21.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:54]** So, Nico, I'm guessing since Rick and Hears, you all are closer to looking around the hallway, Nico, you just start to notice Dr. Okay doing this?

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** Yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** Yeah.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:56]** What do you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:59]** Nico's going to walk over to Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:04]** Hey, big guy, what do you see?

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:09]** I stumbled upon this odd panel on the wall.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** It seems... What's it say?

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** What does it say again?

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:16]** Star... Star Dream 2.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:19]** Something about Star Dream 2.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:19]** It's like emblazoned.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:24]** I'm trying to remember if I've heard that name before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:32]** Nico's going to look kind of down and to the left toward the ground, and he's going to be thinking about how that name sounds familiar to him.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** John, what is he going to discover?

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** What's he going to remember?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** You all both rolled so well.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** I can picture it in my head.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** Sorry, my tinnitus is ringing.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:46]** All I hear is... Can you not hear me, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:48]** The audio is weird.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:51]** Yeah, the music's really loud.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** I can barely hear you, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** Is this better?

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** Yeah, it's much better.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Now we can whisper to each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** It reminds me of a...

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** of a really dumb pun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** Let's hear it.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:02]** This is the time to hear it.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:05]** Right on the precipice of what you remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:07]** What do you call a small dog who's joined the Navy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:14]** A subwoofer.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:18]** It's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:18]** You should give it to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** It's pretty good.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:19]** Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:22]** You know, you know, yeah.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** You've got punishment.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Punishment.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** Use it wisely.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:28]** Use it wisely.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** Make sure you use it.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:34]** Don't just sit on it for like the next five books and then in book six you're like, I'm going to use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:37]** I'm going to use it probably this episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** Watch.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** Okay, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:58]** this punishment expires in three episodes this is good stuff this is good stuff i knew that at some point we just hit it it'd be like oh yeah we're playing it's good yeah so i can i can totally picture in my head both of you maybe are thinking looking absent-mindedly somewhere

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:05]** And maybe both of you realize at the same time and you turn and look at each other.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:15]** The Star Dream 2 is the name of a cruise liner that vanished decades ago near the sun.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** Suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:20]** What?


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:20]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:23]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** How is it possible?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:29]** Sorry, this is like unrelated, but kind of related.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:36]** The building that I lived in, we lived in a house in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, my last year and a half in the Navy.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Yeah.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:44]** And the owner of the home actually used like the wood from an old Mercedes warship.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:49]** It was like a warship called the Mercedes or like it was the style of ship.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:56]** And all the wood paneling in the house was like recycled wood from this old warship.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** So I just think that just brought up like this.

**[00:39:59 - 00:39:59]** This whole thing.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** And a panel used from, yeah.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** This would have been awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:06]** I definitely feel like the day that you leave, you're like talking to the owner and you're like, all right, thanks so much for everything.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** And he's like, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** Apparently the owner was like a complete nut bag.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:10]** We never got to meet him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** Yeah.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:13]** And then he like fades off into existence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** It's like, yeah, years ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:16]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** Turn around and he's gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:21]** And just, just like leaves blowing.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** Yeah.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:23]** So good.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** You hear the Titanic theme in the back.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:29]** Sorry.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** Okay.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** So the Starstream disappeared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:36]** Star Dream 2.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** Star Dream 2.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** Nico and Dr.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** O.K., you realize that it vanished.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:44]** It's a cruise liner that vanished decades ago near the sun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** Nico's going to look at Dr. O.K.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:52]** and he's going to say, isn't that the same cruise liner that Leonardo Copernicus died on?


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** The unsinkable Star Dream 2?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** Yes.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:58]** Very good.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:03]** Didn't it hit an iceberg somewhere in the... Spaceberg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:05]** Spaceberg.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** A solarberg.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:12]** Captain Spaceberg ahead!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** That's pretty good.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:22]** Here's wishes that he could roll a history check to know if pirates did it, but he does not have history checks.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:23]** Culture?

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** I don't have that either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:27]** I'm out of luck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** You would.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:34]** Check your... Because you have pirate as your profession, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:36]** I mean, no, I don't.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** Not technically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:42]** So, Nico, Dr. Okay, are you guys... Are you talking about this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:45]** Are you like... Yeah, we're talking about this.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Definitely talking about this.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:49]** This is a disappeared ship.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** What are we on?

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:52]** Some ghost ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:54]** Nika's going to respond back to Dr. Okay.

**[00:41:54 - 00:42:00]** He's like, when it be my first time, you should have seen the shit we used to do at my old company.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:03]** We refurbished ships that were definitely destroyed.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:10]** There were some wooden slats from more than just a few old derelict vessels.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:14]** So might be coming, might be that same ship.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:17]** Either way, we need to find someone who knows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:21]** Yes, sounds like a good plan.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:33]** We need to... Perhaps the captain might know more about the makeup of this ship and how it came to be in this state.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:37]** You want to check out the crew quarters and then talk to the captain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** I'm sorry, Kelly.

**[00:42:41 - 00:43:07]** voice just reminded me of hey do you want to buy some death sticks so rick and here's i don't know you must have heard some of this i don't know what you're thinking but yeah if you guys want to keep going ahead guys this ship is uh i just relay all this information to them and yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:10]** The gears in Rick's head are just turning, but he doesn't... Literally.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:12]** The literal gears, yeah.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:14]** But he doesn't have any idea what to think of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** Okay.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:25]** Nico's going to suggest to the group, he's going to say, either way, I think it's just good policy to keep information to ourselves until a time when we can find it profitable to reveal it.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:30]** Either as leverage to get someone else to help us get more money.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:32]** Or to get off of this damn ghost ship.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:34]** Or to get out of trouble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:42]** In any case, whatever we find, we keep to ourselves until a time where it's profitable for us to reveal it.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:42]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:46]** Is it possible that we are on some kind of pirate ship?

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** No offense, Hears.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** More than possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** It's very possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:57]** And that this ship was able to take down the Star Dreamer and use it to repair itself?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:01]** That or... Well, they might have just taken it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** Is that something that pirates will do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:05]** They'll just take ships most of the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** They don't take no ship from anybody.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:14]** Can you hack a ship to a point where you change their transponder and all that kind of shit?

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:15]** Rebrand it?

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** Is it easy to do that, John?

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** That's kind of possible.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** What do you think, Daco?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:25]** We used to do it all the time at Orion Industries.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:35]** We would take old derelict vessels that ever since the gap had been in line, just derelict.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:38]** And we converted them into new warships when we sold weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:47]** Slap the side of the starship and be like, you fit so many warheads in this puppy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Start so many wars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:51]** You can start so many wars in this puppy.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:57]** I'm not saying what we did was legal or ethical, but it did make us money.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Okay.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:04]** Rick is just going to raise an eyebrow and then turn back to the corner and kick around it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** Start walking down.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:06]** You start walking.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** Here's what goes to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** So you all start walking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:18]** Can I identify what component of the ship before we continue?

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** Sorry.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:28]** Can I just see what part this is from the star whatever?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** Yeah, I don't think you need to roll.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:35]** It just seems like it's a part of the hull.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** But what purpose does it serve?

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** Just like part of the hull?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** It's just the inner wall.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Well, not the hull.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:44]** It's just the finish on the inner wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:47]** Oh, that wouldn't be something that...

**[00:45:47 - 00:46:14]** necessarily you would like replace ad hoc on another vessel i think so if pirates had anything to do with it they probably just took the damn ship sometime ago maybe we're on this ship do we know anything about that ship like historically like how many crew quarters it had like is there any similarity um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** Was it the largest ship of its time, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:26]** I'll say that if you want to roll another maybe engineering, you could probably try and compare.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:29]** Try and think of what the model of that ship is.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:34]** Think about the model of the ship is and try and get some sort of sense of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** I'm rolling good.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** I got a 22.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** I do have plus five engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:38]** 22.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** Okay.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** Yeah, that's good.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** That's good.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** I'll say this.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:45]** I'll say they're both cruise liners, this ship and that ship.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** Seems like it's similar.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:49]** It's probably a similar complement.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:55]** But you don't remember anything exceptional about the Star Dream 2.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** You just remember being like, yeah, that's the ship that's finished.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** Like roughly the same size, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:01]** Sure.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:01]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:09]** So as far as I could tell, this could be the Star Dream 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:31]** that's not an unreasonable assumption from the role i don't have enough evidence to you know prove it right yeah was the panel like out of place is it or is it just like a single panel is a little like a bad fit it's not framed right it's not like like the contractors putting it in were just kind of shoddy and it was like the end of the day and they're like i'll just finish this and go home

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:35]** You know, it just didn't seem like it was painted quite right.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** It just didn't quite fit right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:37]** Wow.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** Well, that's something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:40]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** Go ahead.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:45]** I was going to say, here's wants to roll perception around this hallway that he's now at the corner of.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:47]** Okay.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** And that's a 21.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:52]** Man, you guys are rolling rocks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:55]** We're rolling rocks on things that matter little.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:58]** I don't know.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** Who's to say?

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:13]** So you turn, you look right, and lo and behold, as you thought, there's a central spine corridor and about four – or sorry, six doors, three on the left, three on the right.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** Seems like a similar sense.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:18]** You can see across from you –

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:21]** It seems like there are little tags on the doors.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:24]** You can see whose room is whose.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** Looks like the crew quarters.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Yeah.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Yeah.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** What do you want to do?

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** Is there something to the left?

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** There are doors.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:35]** There's a set of double doors to the left.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:36]** And yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:41]** Any type of marking on what is on the other side of those doors?

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:43]** Is it like cargo hold?

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:45]** Does it say crew quarters?

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** Does it say... What does it say?

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** Does it say anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** No, it doesn't say anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:52]** Nico's going to call out to the rest of the group.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** Where's Algiada's room?

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:56]** I think that's our next best step here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:58]** I believe it is one of these rooms here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:04]** Well, we can assume that Algiada's room is not home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:07]** I should get two.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** That's Nico's response.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** I should get two punishments for that one.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:16]** Can you get two punishments in one episode?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** No, there is none.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** One punishment.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Just the one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** Just the one.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** Damn it.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:25]** So are you all...

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:54]** exploring you just maybe you're playing finger guns in the hallway um here's just wants to know what these double doors are so yeah i mean if you want to walk up dr okay as you walk up it seems like you all want to try and like go through them uh and they open and as they open you see a let me reveal it you see a very long hallway ending in another set of ladders going up and down

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:58]** And maybe when you picture it, you're like, oh, I guess I get it.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:03]** This is the stairway at the end of the passenger hall, right?

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:10]** Because the ladders that you came up are next to the kitchen in the mid-deck.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:15]** And if you go down those, you still have to walk in this same direction to get to your quarters.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:18]** So your quarters are probably underneath.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:18]** Below.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Yeah.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:23]** Below this hallway and that those ladders at the end lead down to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:27]** And we're towards the stern of the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:33]** No, you all are closer to like the forward.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:35]** So the bow of the ship.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** Right now you're in the middle.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:41]** Above you is the bow, the forward, and then below you is the stern.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** So down the hallway is towards the stern.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:44]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:47]** Our quarters are in the stern of the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:56]** So presumably up, up towards the end, the other end of the hallway would be like the bridge or do we know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** Yeah.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** Okay.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** That's a reasonable assumption.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:00]** Yeah.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:02]** So this is probably, let's check out the rooms.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:04]** Okay.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:08]** Nico's going to nudge and try to get the crew going in that direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:12]** So I'll say you start going.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** No, it's fine.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:18]** I just, are there, is there like name placards?

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** Like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:19]** There are.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:21]** Yeah, that's what I was going to ask.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** Yeah, there are named placards.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:27]** I will point out on the – I'll ping it here.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:34]** Where you're looking up, the room – there seems to be three rooms on the left, three rooms on the right.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:39]** The top left room, as you go through – I'm pinging it right now.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:41]** That says Keeve Cadenz.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:46]** The room immediately across from that – sorry, the top left is Keeve Cadenz.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:48]** The top right, it says Song.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:48]** Song.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:54]** The middle left, it says Algiada E.M.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:58]** Middle right, it says Grath Medic.

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:02]** Bottom left, right across from you, it says Captain Rameem.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:06]** Bottom right, it says Lozupe here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:10]** Did I hear Algiana at all in there?

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** Yeah, there was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** I missed it.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** My brain just didn't listen to that part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:22]** Literally the one room that you guys are looking for, you're like, I don't know.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** So what do you guys want to do?

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:31]** Nico's going to pull out the key and he's just going to look at everybody else like, you ready to go in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Let's do it.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** Question.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:39]** Nico's kind of put in there and he says, behind door number one.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:41]** And they go and he walks in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:42]** Is this?

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Okay.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:49]** So we have only a key to her quarters that was given to us by Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** That doesn't make sense.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** Here's immediately follows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** So did you?

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** I don't know if you guys heard.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:04]** So Tristan X shouted, Keeve did it.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** It's Keeve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:11]** Sorry, I moved y'all out since you didn't go in yet.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:18]** Sorry, I'm just giving y'all a space because then we'll reveal and move forward, but I didn't know if you guys were talking, so I just wanted to let you talk before you go in.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:18]** I'm fine to go in.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Cool.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:28]** So, you take the key and you hold it up to the door.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** Beep, beep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** The door.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** And...

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:43]** As the door slides open, who's in front?

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:43]** Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** Yeah.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:52]** The room, from a quick glance, is small.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** It's kept in, like, seems very orderly.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:57]** There's a desk, simple furniture.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:59]** You can see a neatly made bed.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** You see this immediately, right as it opens.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:10]** But the important thing to notice is the sound of something building up.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:10]** It's

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:16]** And this shot pierces towards the air.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:20]** That is our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** Oh, gosh.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Ridiculous.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** So somebody shot at us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:27]** Probably Algiata defending herself because she thinks that somebody's coming to kill her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** She's not wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:34]** Okay, whoa!

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:41]** First the lights go out, then we find Lozu acting funny, and those goblins, and the Star Dream, and then we walk right into an ambush?

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:44]** Now we have way more questions than we have answers for.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:49]** But there's one answer we know for sure, and that's the answer to our sweepstakes question.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:52]** The question was, what did Dr. O.K.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:52]** find in the gym?

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:57]** And the answer we were looking for is a traditional Hisoki tail ring.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:59]** But as long as you said tail ring, you were entered into the draw.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:02]** And then we took each of those right answers and assigned them a number.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:05]** And now I'm going to roll for it.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:05]** Two.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:09]** And the winner is Matt Dugas.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** Congratulations, Matt.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:15]** We're going to send him a Starfinder core rule book and a message from a crew member of his choice.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:20]** And I'd also like to thank everyone who participated in our first We'll Save Sweepstakes.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:22]** And thank you to all of our listeners.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:24]** We appreciate you tuning in every week.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:27]** We'll catch you next week on We'll Save Wednesdays.
