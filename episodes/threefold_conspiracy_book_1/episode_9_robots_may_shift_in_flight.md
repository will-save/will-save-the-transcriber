**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Last time on We'll Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:07]** The flight for our traveling companions continues to deteriorate.

**[00:00:08 - 00:00:19]** As Lozu admits to Rick-19 that she knows nothing of the relationship between Algiata and Trostenec, Professor Benjam calls our adventures into his quarters.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:31]** Terrified, Professor Benjam reveals the existence of his valuable cargo and requests our adventurers to find Algiata, believing the missing security guard might be after it.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:42]** As he hears plots of ways to take the cargo for himself, the group reaches the cargo hold to find an unconscious Trostenec and wary security droid.

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:44]** Is this droid friend or foe?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:43]** You want to know why I'm excited?

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Why?

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** Stoked?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** What if I say no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** Why are you stoked, John?

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** Why are you stoked?

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** Okay.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** All right.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** What if I don't want to know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:54]** We can just move on.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:54]** It's fine.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** We'll just move on.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:55]** That's fine.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** That's fine.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:56]** You know what?

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** That's all right.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** I'm going to stop recording now.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** Good night.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** See you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** That's the end of the episode.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** Thank you for listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:09]** That was all of it.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** Come on, John.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** I want to know.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:11]** Okay.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** All right.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** All right.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** All right.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** All right.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** All right.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:13]** Hold down.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:14]** Hold on, Nick.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** So I'm stoked.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:20]** One, because we're playing Starfinder and recording new app.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** Obviously.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:21]** Obviously.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:25]** But I'm also stoked because...

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** It's like a nice, crisp Sunday morning.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:31]** I think this is our first, like, morning game that we're playing.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:37]** Can we QE Sunday morning?

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Rhythm of mind.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Rhythm of mind.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** Yeah, it's like, it's just different.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** It's a different vibe.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:52]** Anybody out there who can hopefully play this week and have a good vibe like this, hope you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** I mean, I'm a morning person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:58]** And we're getting the game in before the Packers game.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:00]** Yeah, so Kev's excited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** Kev's excited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** It's a busy day for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** Just saying.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** Well, what else are you doing today, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** Oh, we're taking our family pictures.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:09]** Whoa!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** I always forget people do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** First family pictures with Grayson?

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:16]** Yeah, a little baby Grayson.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:16]** That's pretty awesome.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** I'm a little upset with my wife.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:26]** She didn't take into account the dog, and where we're going is not pet-friendly, so Bodhi's going to miss out on the family pictures.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:28]** We're going to have to just Photoshop him in later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** Yeah, just Photoshop him in.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:31]** Just shittily Photoshop him in.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:34]** I think Bodhi just got shafted.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** Does he need a home now?

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** Bodhi really got the short end of his stick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:40]** All right, now this is going to be the debate for the day, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:42]** Does Bodhi want to live with Ninja?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:49]** Is it like one of those, there's people that still do, they take like pictures, but then they have like, they sort of paint over it or something.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:53]** And it kind of looks like some Renaissance era family photo painting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:54 - 00:04:23]** that was like a big I think we were just planning my cousin's a photographer so we're just gonna go to a park and like take nice pictures it's a park that's not pet friendly there's a lot of parks that aren't pet friendly there's a lot of them there's more to it I don't have the details you know what you should do you should do like the 90s after effect where it's like Bodhi's face is really big and like kind of faded in in the corner like the glamour shots yeah the glamour shots in the back yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:26]** But in the tree on the way.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:35]** So after we finish recording the Packers start playing and then on the way to the pictures, I'll be watching the Packers game in the car.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:36]** Got it.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:39]** So busy day busy while you're driving.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** No, my wife will drive.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** Probably best.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** I'm responsible.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:45]** I'm a responsible human.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:47]** If you need to say that, does that mean that you are?

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:50]** I don't believe you.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** Is there anything else?

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** I have a baby now.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** It's time to become responsible.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** Kelly has a baby too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** Congratulations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:01]** What?

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** All right.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:07]** I kind of want to just kick this Sunday session high gear, just jump right in because I'm stoked for what's going to happen.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:19]** But is there anything else, any more wisdom that we feel like we collectively want to impart to our listeners before we play the game that they decided to listen to this episode to hear us play?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:24]** You should all be subscribed to us on social media.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:25]** That too.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** That's great.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:31]** And in the words of Paul McCartney and John Lennon, let it be.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:36]** Speaking words of wisdom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** Speaking words of wisdom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** Let it be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:42]** It's at We'll Save the Podcast on Instagram.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:44]** It's at We'll Save Podcast on Twitter.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** No article.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:46]** What else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** No definite article.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** No definite article.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:52]** All right, Nick, was there something you want to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:52 - 00:06:05]** Yeah, I think just for the group, or not for the group, for our listeners here, I think it might be actually a good idea to roll through rules for computers.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:13]** Just so everybody knows, I'm reading the rules right now, and it's very complicated.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:20]** And there are a whole bunch of stuff in here, and there are a lot of story-driven elements that come into play here.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** So I think it's going to be great for the listeners to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:30]** I do think that Paizo would really appreciate us if we just said, you should learn the rules yourself and go buy the core rulebook written by Paizo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** Yeah.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** It's actually really pretty, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:32]** Absolutely.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** In addition to that, it's beautiful.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** Yeah, I want to add

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:45]** that by the time that you're listening to this, I have written a quick guide to computers and Starfinder.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:55]** That's like a flow chart of when you want to access a computer or something like it, what you would need to go through to do and some of the relevant DCs and rules just to make it a little easier.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:58]** So we'll probably post that on our website, social media.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:03]** I wonder if this is going to be content that's going to be available to people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:14]** That way, when you decide to play, to join us in the packed world and beyond, then you'll have the relevant skills.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:14]** Thank you, Nick.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** And also, thank you, Paizo.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** Thank you, Roll20.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** Thank you, Sirenscape.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** LoneWolfHeroLab.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** Who am I forgetting?

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** AudioJungle for providing this waiting music.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** Thank you, John Swan, for being amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:29]** Yes.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** Thank you.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:30]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** Thank you, John, for being awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:39]** But Nick, with the computer stuff, do you have like a quick two sentence summary, like the most important part that you figured out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** Just now.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:50]** In my studies, the most important thing I figured out, well, there are a whole bunch of stuff in there, but computers over a weight of 25 are not designated to be portable.

**[00:07:51 - 00:08:00]** Unless you can get miniaturization technology, you can actually get a computer and have it have different interfaces.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:06]** You can actually uninstall former interfaces and install an audio only interface and

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:10]** If you want to, you can do it for free, but the comm unit associated, you will have to pay for.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:13]** There are different stages of access.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:22]** There's basic access that when you look at something, you can tell right off the bat whether or not it's something you're going to have to hack or not.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** And there are different modules for that.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:27]** I was just getting to that area as well.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:33]** It's very specific and a lot of, it's a lot of stuff to keep in mind and a lot of stuff to keep in mind when you're

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:49]** It's one of those things that I think as you play your character, you get intimately familiar with, but not something that right off the bat you were going to be a master of and could easily find yourself frustrated without a full mastery of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:53]** That kind of makes sense because you're developing your character as he levels up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** Yeah, you're learning.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** It's kind of true, yeah.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:59]** You know, I want to take that to kind of jump right in here.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** We're going to bridge this.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** We're going to do a little transition because I want to ask you all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** That's my jump noise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** Did you make a Mario jump noise?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:06]** Boing!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:06]** Boing!


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:09]** Boing!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:14]** I think last time we ended on a little bit of the door opening.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:24]** But before we get to that, I just want to ask you, what do each of your characters think is, like, going on?

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:26]** Right?

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:53]** got on the ship there was conflict beforehand in the docking bay you get on the ship there's another conflict in the galley you've talked to people without going too far into the backstory i'm just going to ask you guys what does each of your characters think is going on right now uh i think nico will go first here on this one nico doesn't know what's going on uh people are being cagey he


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:57]** As far as the conspiracy is concerned, he has no evidence of that.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:06]** Just what some of his assumed comrades would have told him.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:10]** However, he's looking for cooperating evidence.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:18]** At this point, in Nico's mind, the only thing he thinks it is is a possible pirate incursion that has yet to have happened.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:23]** But the engines cutting out would tend to lend itself to a pirate incursion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:33]** here's being a former pirate does agree with that analysis and kind of worries him because he, um, well, he's no longer one.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** So that'll be interesting.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:37]** But, um, uh, he also doesn't know what's happening.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** He was just drunk with Nico.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:42]** Um, so he's still kind of catching up on all the details from his other conference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:44]** So here's that, that weird shanty thing.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:50]** Is there some kind of, I'm just curious, like what's your guys' thoughts on each other singing the same shanty.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** And if you don't want to reveal that yet, that's, that's fine too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:53 - 00:11:00]** But that is like this weird connection between you all that I don't think anybody else has had.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:05]** You've had the first real moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** Yeah, me and Rick only have shared a secret.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** Some kind of conspiracy is happening.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:15]** I'll be honest, he's an android, so... Can you elaborate on that?

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** What?

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** He's an android?

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:20]** So do you feel like it's less of a bond?

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** I guess...

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** It's hard to talk to him, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:26]** Look.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:28]** Do you mean he has a negative one in charisma?

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:31]** We're going to go see Counts on Thursday.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** I have a negative one in charisma, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:35]** We'll save Wednesday's Counts on Thursday.

**[00:11:36 - 00:12:03]** here's Nick if you don't want to get into it you don't have to you can save it for later as it comes out in the story but I just saying I know that you guys have this connection people are curious the forums are a lot here's like stole weapons from him and you know we should take bets honestly we probably can team I can't take that bet


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:05]** But I support you doing it.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:16]** As an outside character, not outside character, but as somebody that wasn't involved in that duet, we know there's some kind of connection there.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:19]** It's almost like watching people fall in love from a distance.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:21]** They don't know it's happening, but we can see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:26]** I mean, the comment section is crazy.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:26]** On fire.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:28]** The theories about why that's the case.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** Just trying to help the listeners out.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** But, you know...

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** Keep your secrets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** So I'll move on.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:38]** So Rick then, he thinks there's something going on between these two.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:42]** That's what he's all concerned about.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:49]** Overall theory, though, Rick and Dr.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:57]** O.K., they overheard that conversation between the chief security officer and a random, quote-unquote, random passenger.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** And so they think there's something going on there.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:12]** And then with all the stuff going on around the professor and the bugs and now the power going out and now this giant robot, Rick is kind of trying to put all the pieces together, and he thinks that...

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:25]** There's almost like a mutiny going on that the security officer is involved with somebody else and is talking about taking over the ship and possibly stealing the relic is one of my thoughts, Rick's thoughts.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** So that's kind of where he stands.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:29]** He just sees chaos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:32]** Yeah, because then the security officer disappeared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:34]** Disappeared?

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** I don't think she disappeared.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** Rick thinks that she's involved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:40]** What does Dr. O.K.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:40]** think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:43]** Doctor, okay.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:55]** I mean, Osharu's are naturally very paranoid of outsiders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Sorry, quick question.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** Where is an Osharu's brain?

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** Because you're thinking.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** Is your brain in the head of the Osharu?

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:07]** Because they're like a gelatin-like slug person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** I mean, they're not gelatin.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** They're gelatin.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** Do you want to look at a picture right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:16]** No, I've seen pictures, but you should... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** They have a head.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:17]** Oh.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** All you listeners, you should Google Osharu Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** I was just curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** So the brain is in the head?

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:24]** You know, let's write Paizo.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** It's like a humanoid slug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** Do your Paizo.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** Yeah.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** Where is the brain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:35]** I did one time get one of the writers of the books to respond to me with a question I had.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:35]** Okay.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** And they were super nice.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:39]** So I'm going to just follow up because we're buds now.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** So I'm going to follow up.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:40]** Yeah.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** Be like, by the way.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** We're buds now.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:47]** By the way, I have this player who's a slug.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:48]** Anyways.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:51]** He's kind of cute.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** So, yeah.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** He's naturally...

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** Uh, very paranoid.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:06]** And I think he suspects that there is a larger, like someone's pulling the strings.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:19]** and who has yet to reveal himself, or maybe will never reveal himself, but he doesn't like the thought of being a cog in this wheel of deceit.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:20]** Deceit!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** Death!

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:27]** Here's also really wants to see that relic as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:29]** But he's a pirate.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** What's his purpose for seeing it?

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** What would be that?

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:32]** I wonder why.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** Yeah, what's his real purpose there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:44]** As far as the relic is concerned, Nico's more along the lines of wanting to take it and use it as blackmail either against the professor or sell it to the highest bidder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:46]** Wow.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:49]** You are undermining a lot here.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:53]** That's pretty underhanded for an executive of a company.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** What's your class again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:57]** He's an envoy.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:57]** Douchebag.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:09]** He's an envoy with a... I think he's a... I think the actual kind of genre he is is... The theme.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** Yeah, the theme.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:14]** Yeah, the theme I think is like a business person or something like that.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Corporate agent.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** Yeah.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** But like little side notes.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** It's not Icon, right?

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** No.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** I don't think it's Icon.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:23]** No.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:27]** Side note, he will be multi-classing.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** So there's a fun fact for you.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:29]** Good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:33]** I think it's the first time that we talked about what our classes are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:36]** So, you know, well done.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:39]** Sorry to pull the curtain back.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:41]** So I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** I knew they would come out at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:45]** It only took nine episodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:47]** Yeah, it's only nine episodes in.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:48]** Like, two months later.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:53]** So the doors slide open.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** And you all see...

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:24]** humanoid robot wearing over padded armor standing near a large open crate and it's it's heart shaped face glows an ominous red as it's scanning the hold and there's a small arm on its shoulder that moves independently of the construct's body

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:28]** There are two doors, north and south.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** Rick is at the southern door.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:33]** Here's Nico and Dr. O'Key are at the northern door.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:40]** And lying in front of this construct is Trostenec, the Vesk.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** Sprawled, unconscious.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:46]** Face, mostly their eye, bruised.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** I'm going to go to the map.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:53]** I'm going to bring you guys into the map here.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:54]** God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:01]** I'm going to click on this robot and show you guys what it looks like.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:03]** See that?

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:04]** Whoa.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** That's pretty crazy.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:09]** It is such awesome artwork.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:11]** It's like the Michelin Man on steroids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:17]** Yeah, it is an intense robot with like three massive muscular fingers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:19]** Why does it have a heart on its face?

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** It's not a heart.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** It's a carotid.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** Cardioid.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:23]** That thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** So we'll get there, Nick.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:36]** So as the door slides open, it turns and it faces in Nico's and Dr.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** O.K.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** 's direction.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:42]** And you hear in the cargo hold, Halt.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** Do not resist.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** And you all need to roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** Oh, it's going down.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:55]** If you want to go and take a shot with me, then roll for initiative.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** I need that drop, too.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:58]** Strong to start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** All righty here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:04]** Dang.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** Rick's initiative is 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Wow.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:07]** Dang.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:07]** All right.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** We're going to get into that in a minute.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** Rick got a 20.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** Whose other dice did I hear rolling?

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** That was me.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:17]** That was Nico Ryan.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:21]** Nico Ryan, what did you get with your underhanded initiative?

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:23]** With my underhanded initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** That's what we're going to call it from now on.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:29]** That's fine.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:32]** Nico's underhanded initiative was...

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** Let's see here.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:37]** Where do I see my initiative modifier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** On Hero Lab?

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:38]** Combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** The combat.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** It's in the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** Result points.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:43]** It's in the middle.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:45]** Can't they just put that at the top?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:46]** No.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** That'd be nice.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:47]** They can't.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** They won't.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:54]** If any of you who are listening work for Lone Wolf, that's a suggestion.

**[00:19:54 - 00:20:00]** Let's have a drag and drop interface for the dashboard of character sheets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:01]** That sounds easy.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:03]** Yeah, that sounds good.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:06]** Yeah, Kelly, how easy is that?

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** Just roll a computer check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** Just roll a computer check.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** All right.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:13]** Here's my underhanded admission of roll was a 19.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:14]** Wow.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:14]** Everything included.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** Yeah.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:15]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:18]** Sounds underhanded because it's so high, conveniently so high.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:20]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** Hears and Dr. Okay, what'd you get?

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** I got a 13 for Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** Got a 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:29]** What did Dr. Okay get?

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:31]** Dr. Okay got a 10.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:31]** Oh, man.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:36]** I'm feeling very sluggish this morning.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** I can tell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:40]** That's not a punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:42]** That's not a punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:49]** Reminder, in case you're just listening, if this is the first episode that you're listening to, I encourage you to go back and listen to episode one.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:55]** But if it is, punishment is where we dole out some bonuses if you make a pun that's really good, and we all agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** Wait, it has to be unanimous?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:59]** I think, yeah.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** We all vote.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:01]** Right?

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:03]** So, you know what's going to happen here.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:12]** I think, from the way it looks right now, this robot honed in on Nico and Dr. Okay.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:19]** And I know, Rick, you went up last episode, you talked about stealth and opened the door.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** Right?

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:20]** Am I right?

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Damn straight.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** Damn straight.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:26]** Now we're going to need that E for explosive rating.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** Uh...

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:31]** So I think, and Hears, you're behind the door.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:39]** So I think Hears and Rick, you all get to act in a surprise round.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:39]** Ouch.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** Woo!

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** I think it was our first surprise round, too.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** So this is good.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:49]** So in a surprise round, the one big thing is that we're going to go in initiative order, right?

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:57]** So you all are the quote-unquote surprisers, and the Construct and Nico and Dr. Okay, you're...

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:01]** let's call it the surprise, but the important party here is the construct, right?

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** So the construct is surprised.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:09]** Now, uh, it has certain conditions like being, I think in star finder, it's flat footed.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:19]** Um, but Rick, the important thing for Rick and here's is that you all get to take either a standard action or a move action in this surprise round.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:22]** So we're going to go in order.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** So that's going to be Rick.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** And then it's going to be here's.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** And then we're going to start round one.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:32]** So, Rick, what are you doing with your surprise room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** Can I do a perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:34]** Yeah.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:37]** What do you want to do with a perception check?

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** What are you trying to perceive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:45]** I want to perceive this robot and see if there's any markings or anything significant to give me a clue of what this robot is.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** Is it part of the ship?

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:51]** Is it something from outside the ship that somebody snuck into the cargo bay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:52]** Okay.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:58]** So I think that would be also... Are you trying to do a life science check to identify the robot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** No, not necessarily a life science check.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:03]** I don't care about the robot itself.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** I want to know...

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:13]** I'm curious on whether or not it is like ship security robot or if it is a robot that was like snuck in as cargo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:19]** What was your perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** I perceived the plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:24]** On a scale from one to let's call it like 30.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** Yeah.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** What did you perceive?

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** Well, because you got your bonuses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** I got a 13.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** Okay.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** Well, so let's talk about this.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:36]** The robot and Trostnick are in the middle of this rectangular-shaped room.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:39]** You guys are on the long side here with the doors.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:45]** Rick, there is a set of... Okay, so I guess I will do my move action first, right?

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:48]** Well, you only have a move action or a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:48]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** So that's what I'm saying.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:52]** I'll do my move action before I perceive or as I perceive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:54]** What's your move action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** I have to see what my move is first.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:58]** What is my run...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** Probably 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:02]** Where is it?

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** Oh, no.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:04]** 25.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:08]** It's all the way down at the bottom of the combat thing.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** It's above gear.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:11]** I have a speed of 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:11]** Oh, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** Sorry, my bad.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:17]** So let me check to see where I can run to.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:17]** No.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:18]** Okay.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:21]** So he's just going to run to here then and get by this box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:22]** Okay.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** So you're going to run up.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:28]** There's like a set of four five by five boxes in a square.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** Those are probably, those are half height, right?

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:34]** The big ones on the right side here, those are taller.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** Those are like... Which ones are taller?

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** These ones?

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:40]** The ones that have all the blue tape on them are smaller.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:42]** Those are probably, like, three to four feet.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:46]** The larger ones over here are larger, like, containers, right?

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:48]** Those are probably closer to, like, six feet.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:52]** And this is a pretty tall robot construct.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:57]** So you run, you crouch by, you do a 13 out of 20 perception check.

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:00]** And I can tell you that— Oh, I also pulled out my weapon—


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** Oh, I already had my weapon out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** You can take a swift action.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** But I think you already had your weapon out.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:09]** But yeah, you can use a swift action in a surprise round.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** So from your perception...

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:17]** You think that this likely came from the container that you can see.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:21]** This door behind it, the wall is on the ground.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:23]** So it probably came out of this container.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** That's what you notice.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:27]** Here's what you're doing with your surprise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:30]** He kind of looks like the Lost in Space robot from the remake.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:33]** He looks like the Michelin Man on steroids.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** He's kind of cute.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:43]** So I'm going to, with the computers or engineering check, can I discern some weaknesses or something with this robot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:45]** You can do an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:49]** That would be a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:52]** It's an identified creature, yeah?

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** Yeah, which is life science.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:58]** So on page 133 of the Starfinder core rulebook,

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:03]** It shows the list of creatures and what skill could be used to identify them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** So that would be an engineering check.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:05]** Yeah.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** Give me an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:07]** Okay.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:08]** And I can assist, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:10]** Not computers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:16]** Since it's a surprise round, I think you wouldn't be able to because it's just him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** Well, I can try again then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:22]** Yeah, you can try on your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:24]** All right, well, I'll do engineering.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** Give me an engineering check.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** It's a nine.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** It's not that high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** It's a nine, yeah.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:32]** You don't, unfortunately, know.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** You're not quite sure.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:38]** I mean, you've seen robots before, but this is kind of baffling to you.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** Maybe you haven't seen this before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:44]** John, can I roll a cultural roll on this with my profession?

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** On your turn.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:51]** Could I also do perception to see if I could see the object that it's guarding?

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** Is that possible?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** It's guarding something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** I didn't say it was guarding something.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:00]** I think he's saying that he wants to see what is going on with it.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** Right.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:05]** I'll say you can go ahead and do a quick perception check.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:05]** That's fine.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** You're already looking at that direction.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:10]** But then after that, you only have your mover standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** Got it.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** It's a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:12]** 19.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:12]** Okay.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:22]** You don't see anything in the immediate vicinity right around that container that looks like it is maybe what you're expecting to see.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:24]** And it doesn't necessarily look like it's guarding anything.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** You just see an unconscious Vesk.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** So what do you want to do with your standard or move action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:31]** Is he unconscious or is he dead?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:33]** You're going to have to go find out.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Life science check.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:38]** Here's what do you want to do with your standard or move action?

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Is it alive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:41]** Oh, it's a dead science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:47]** No, but life science is, well, there's specific rules about life science.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:47]** There is.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** Here's what are you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:53]** Alright, I'm just going to attack it.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:56]** I can't do much else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:02]** The problem is that you don't have a free 5-foot step, so to see it, you're going to have to move, which would be your move action.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:03]** See what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:05]** Okay, I'm going to move into this door.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:12]** Can he delay his surprise round and then take it right before he gets his next move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:18]** If you want to use your standard action to do something that would be like a delay or a ready, that's fine.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:22]** You have a standard action to use and a move action to use.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:27]** I'm going to delay my attack until I can step forward and see this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:30]** So you're going to move up behind that crate?


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** I'll do as Kevin suggests.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** Actually, that's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** Well, then you should move back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** I don't think you'd actually do that.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** I think you're in a good spot right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:40]** So if you move up, yeah.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:44]** So I'll say this for everyone listening at home, picturing it in their heads.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:48]** Rick has moved behind one set of like three to four high set of crates.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:53]** Here's has also moved behind the other set of crates in the northern end.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:57]** I will say that both of you and then here's just moved again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** Sorry.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:03]** I'll stay behind this big old crate here that looks like it's duct taped down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:07]** Okay, so I will say that both of you will have cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:13]** Whether that is partial cover or cover, we'll get to it when it's your turn, but we will see.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:16]** But funny enough, it is the end of the surprise round.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:19]** Beginning of round one, Rick19, what are you doing?

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Top of round one.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:21]** It's my turn again?

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** You got the highest initial.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:43]** all right so first rick is gonna do another perception check but this time it's gonna he's gonna be looking at all the crates he wants to know like he's gonna analyze the crate that the thing came out of but he's also gonna look to see if there are other crates that are similar okay what's your what's your what's your check i've rolled a one plus four is a five


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** They all look the same to you.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:45]** Yeah.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** The big boxes.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** All these giant boxes.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** It's my Amazon package.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** Three giant boxes.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:51]** Yeah.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:54]** Bezos, how did you get into Starfinder 2?

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:57]** It is... You can't play Starfinder on Alexa, which is very fun.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** But back to the combat.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:00]** Rick, what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:04]** So Rick is... I mean, is this thing hostile?

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** Like, we know it's hostile.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** It said halt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:08]** Do not resist.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** So Rick is going to shout...

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** Stand down.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** And he's going to delay his action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:20]** Or be destroyed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:20]** Okay.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** Rick is going to shout, stand down.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:27]** And then he is going to use which action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** Delay an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:32]** So after any creature takes his turn, you can come out of delay and take your turn.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:35]** That will change your initiative count for the rest of it.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:36]** Does that make sense?

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:55]** yep cool all right so you're delaying so there's so wait ready action is i ready an action to trigger on something right delay is you just delay until after a creature takes its turn and then you say i'm coming in with my action okay yeah got it i will delay okay cool nico what are you doing it's your turn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** All right.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:07]** Nico is first, he's going to roll a, he wants to roll a profession check to see if he can identify this type of security droid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:11]** I mean, this is right out of your domain, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:13]** Where is profession in here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** Page 146.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:14]** Page 146.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:34]** profession you are skilled at this call knowledge your profession can you can use your profession to recall knowledge about your profession and related topics and then go back to page 133 so do recall knowledge to see if you recognize this tech yeah i think on identified creature it's still an idea it's both


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** I'll say this.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:41]** If you want to find out more about it, it's probably like an identify creature thing.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:47]** If you want to just see what it is, that's more of a recall knowledge thing because the profession is considered like a broad thing.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:51]** And then these like life science skills are like very specific things.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:54]** So if you want to recall what it is, then I'll say you can do that.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:57]** You can also recall what it is with the life science check.

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:00]** And I would just give you like a plus two because of your profession.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Okay, I'll do that then.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** We'll do a life science with a plus two on the book.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:04]** Okay.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** Whatever you do, roll high.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** Okay, so give me a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:09]** Sorry, it would be an engineering check.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** Yeah, it would be an engineering.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** Can I aid?

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** It would be an engineering check.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:14]** Yeah, Dr. Okay, you can aid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** I can also aid?

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:18]** Ooh, fucking natural 20.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:21]** When it didn't happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** Plus two.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:31]** Nick, you have a plus two from Dr. Okay, and you have a plus two because of your profession in technological security stuff like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** That's a natural 14.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:35]** That's going to make it an 18 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:36]** An 18.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:38]** Okay, so I'll say this.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:42]** You did beat the DC, and I will say...

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:48]** The only thing that I realize I don't know is how many things you get to know when you succeed.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:58]** I'm going to say that because of your profession and everything, you can, one, see what kind of creature this is, and two, you get to know one thing about it.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:58]** Okay.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:03]** So I'm just making that rule, and as we're going, write in on social media.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:03]** Good job to you.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:07]** If I made a mistake, then I'll probably just tell you that you're rude.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** That's what I'll say.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:11]** So, Nico, this is what you know.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:15]** You know that this is an incapacitator robot.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:20]** These are typically built to restrain, subdue.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:24]** Usually, like you've seen a lot of bounty hunter clients get these.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:29]** Typically, what they look like are actually like a dome.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:31]** It kind of looks like the planter that we talked about earlier.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:34]** It's like a dome with four legs that come up, but really large.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:42]** But there are certain models, let's call them friendlier, and have a layer of soft cushioning material.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:45]** And they're sometimes called like hugbots.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:48]** Because they squeeze and hold targets.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** It's like a constrictor.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:53]** And you can tell that this is one of those specialized models that has the heart.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:58]** And so if the heart were blue, as in the picture that I showed you, it looks a little friendlier, right?

**[00:33:59 - 00:33:59]** And you might not know.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** So that's what you know about it.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:09]** And one of the things that you know about it is that it is vulnerable to critical hits.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** What isn't vulnerable to critical hits?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:14]** Oh, what's the name of that cartoon series?

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** Is it Bayomax?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Sorry?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:19]** What's the name of that cartoon movie?

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** Baymax.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:21]** Baymax.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** All right.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:27]** So, Nico, you have done an identify on this incapacitated robot.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** What do you want to do with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:37]** I think Nico is going to shoot at the midsection.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:39]** Uh, not where the creature.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:40]** Yeah.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:43]** Not where the padding is, but where the midsection is.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:44]** Okay.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** You showed us on there.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** First shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:48]** Mechanically.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:52]** I don't think that that's necessarily going to get you any like more, but what weapon are you using?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:57]** Uh, I'm using my, I'm using my dual pistols, my dual azimuth lasers.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** Did you have them both pulled out?

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** Yes.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** I had them both pulled out before we opened the door.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** That was, we ended the last podcast.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:04]** All right.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:07]** So the first roll is a nine.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** Okay.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** First roll's a nine.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** You miss.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** The door's open.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:14]** It flies back and hits the back of the cargo hold.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** Don't forget your minuses to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:17]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:20]** I'm just trying to make sure I do this right.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** I have a plus two.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:24]** You want to talk about what you're trying to make right?

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** There were no minuses.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** There were no minuses.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** Whatever I roll on the die is whatever.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** Whenever I'm shooting twice is whatever.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:30]** Okay.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Got it.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** What's your next roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** You take one shot.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:34]** It misses.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** Next shot is an 18.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:40]** That is a hit.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:44]** Tell me what's going on with the damage.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:44]** All right.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** Sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** That's one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:50]** One point of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** One point of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Okay, that's fine.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** It's a start.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:58]** Hits, leaves a little char mark.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:01]** Because of your attack roll, I'll say you did hit the midsection.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:07]** Mechanically, that's not going to do anything different, but you did leave kind of like a burn mark on there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:11]** Can Niko also say before his turn ends, he wants to call it out.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** It's an incapacitator droid.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** Good job, Niko.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:15]** Oh, thanks.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** All right, Niko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** Niko, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** Thanks for the info.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:22]** I know these drugs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** Affirmative.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:30]** So it is going to move up to here.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** And you see it turn its arm.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:35]** And, like, something comes into its arm.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:42]** And it's going to throw a grenade.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Oh, no!

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:43]** Oh!

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** So you see it's like...

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:48]** It throws and it's going to aim right here.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** Boom.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:53]** Right in between Nico and Dr. Okay.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Fucking droid.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** Yeah, man, this is so exciting.

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:00]** It's throwing a sticky bomb grenade.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:04]** I need you to give me a reflex saving throw.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Wait, what's the fuse delay on that thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:08]** If it's an eight-second delay, they get at least one turn before it goes off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:09]** Eight-second delay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** Yeah, isn't that typical for a grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** I don't think so.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:17]** No, you throw it, you make sure it hits, and then you're... That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:20]** That's a 17 on the die plus four.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** That's a 21 on my reflex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:25]** Is that the mechanic that we're supposed to do for this?

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** Two to six seconds.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:27]** This is real life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:30]** Yeah, for real life.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** But we're playing Starfinder.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** It throws it.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** It's part of the six seconds.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** Starfinder is real life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:35]** Future grenades.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** Okay.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** What did you get?

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** 21, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** Yeah.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:43]** Also a 21.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** Wow.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** Both of you did well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:45]** All right.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** So 20, 20.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** I rolled a 19.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:49]** I thought it was plus.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:49]** I was reading it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** That's okay.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** So it throws the grenade.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** It explodes.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:56]** And you all are able to kind of like crouch and move out of the way.

**[00:37:56 - 00:38:00]** And all this weird, sticky material comes out.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** But you are not entangled.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:06]** You did well escaping that.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:09]** And I'm a little annoyed because I want you to get entangled.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** That is its turn.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Here's what are you doing?

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** On your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:14]** Let's see here.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:20]** I think, like, I can on my... Good Lord.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:21]** My Alexa.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:26]** I think I can, like, move around like this with, like... Okay.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:26]** For 30 feet.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** And then... Uh-huh.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** I then will do magic missile.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:43]** And here's, I'll just be like, ah, and then like fire, which turns out to be, uh, one D four plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** So wait, I never got my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** Oh, did we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** Well, it's your, it's your delay.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:49]** Yeah.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:51]** You had your turn.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** I asked what you wanted to do.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:55]** You said that you wanted to delay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:57]** And I delayed until after the capacitor threw the grenade.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** Now it's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** Oh, I didn't hear that part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** You didn't say that.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:02]** I said delay, and delay was until the creature moves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:06]** But you don't need to give me a trigger like you do for ready.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** So you don't need to tell me when.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:11]** You can just say, I'm going to delay, and then you're like, I'm going to come in then.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** That's fine.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** That was totally my bad.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:16]** I didn't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:19]** I thought you moved me behind the creature.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:22]** Okay, I will now move you behind the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** Finish your turn.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** I'll take it.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:25]** Thank you.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** We'll move simultaneously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:30]** It should be an eight damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Eight damage.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** Wow.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:34]** All right.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:36]** So that's two missiles, right?

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Right in the back.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:37]** Or three?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:40]** It's two because it's not a full action, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** Full action?

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** Okay.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:41]** All right.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** So bam, bam, bam.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:45]** Hits the incapacitated robot in the back.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:50]** Rick, what are you doing on your what should have been first but is now second for the moment for this round?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** Rick is going to scramble over to here.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** He's going to do a perception check.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:58]** Just like a quick look at the vest and inside the box.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Okay.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** If I can find my D20.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:02]** What did I just do with it?

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** I lost it.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:05]** How did I lose my D20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:06]** It's gone forever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** No, seriously.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Oh, found it.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** I found it.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** All right, here it goes.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Oh, damn it, man.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** I'm doing terrible.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:19]** Six plus four, I think.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** Yeah, 6 plus 4, so I roll the 10.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** I want to see if he's alive or just breathing.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** That's my perception, is if he's breathing or not.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:30]** And then if there's anything inside the box, it's going to let me... See anything that's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** Okay, all right.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** Trostenec does appear to be breathing.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Seems to be unconscious.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:40]** That's as much as you can know without doing any sort of a medicine check, which you have to be trained for.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** When you look over in the box...

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** You don't see anything.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:54]** You just see cargo, maybe some like boxes that look like they could be kind of like personal belongings and maybe a couple of provisions.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:59]** Seems like they kind of just lumped everything into one and put it into this big box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:59 - 00:40:59]** Okay.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:05]** So Rick takes his artillery cannon or laser and he shoots Trusk a neck in the face.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:06]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** What a twist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:11]** He's going to shoot the robot in the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:43]** so let me get to my weapons page give me that roll big old weapon okay what are you doing it's a 7 plus 5 to hit so 12 to hit 12 to hit with your artillery laser it misses and it hits some of the strapped down boxes on the side and it like kind of scrapes and leaves some burn marks there that was a miss is that the end of your turn

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** Yeah, that's the end of my turn.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:44]** Okay.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:45]** Disappointed.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Good try.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:46]** Sorry.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:48]** Dr. Okay, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:56]** I want to see if I can identify any weaknesses other than critical hits, if that's possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:57]** Okay.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:57]** All right.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** Give me an engineering check.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** Are you trained in engineering?

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** Yes, I am.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:01]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** That's a 24.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:03]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:06]** 24.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:13]** I will say that you can figure out another weakness, and you see that it is vulnerable to electricity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:17]** I'm going to relay this information.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Okay.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:22]** Guys, it's vulnerable to electric energy.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:25]** Unfortunately, I have nothing to offer this.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:29]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:32]** It's vulnerable to electrical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:37]** But I can't really do anything about it.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** So what are you doing?

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:42]** So I'm going to hit myself with a booster.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:45]** Okay.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** And I'm going to.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:58]** Yeah, I'm just going to hit myself with a booster and add 10 feet of movement just so I can hopefully outrun this guy.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:01]** Yeah.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:02]** Sorry, guys.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** I can't be more help.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:11]** I'll get back in the fight to make sure you guys are healed and all that as best I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:11]** All right.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:12]** Yeah.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** Good stuff.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** I get to move, though, right?

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** Yeah.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** You can move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** I'm going to move.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:19]** Yep.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:20]** Okay, move.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:22]** I'm going to run.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** So for everyone listening, Dr.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** O.K., where do you run?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:29]** I'm running down the hallway to the other door to back up Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:29]** Okay.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:30]** All right.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:33]** So you're running in the outside hallway to the other door.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:34]** Is that your turn?

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:35]** Yes.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:38]** All right, top of round two.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** Nico, what are you doing?

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** We're in combat.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** Things are moving.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** Things are flying.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** Wait, isn't it Rick's turn?

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** Nope.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:45]** Rick moved.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** Rick delayed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:48]** When you delay and come back in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:55]** No, but if you read, when you delay, wherever you come in, that is your initiative for the rest of the combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** Oh, I wouldn't have done that then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** Gotta read the rules.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** So many rules.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:02]** Nico, what are you doing?

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** So many rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:06]** Nico's going to look over at Dr. OK.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:09]** Way to leave me over on my own here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:12]** Well, you can join me.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** That's true.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** You could take that.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** You do what you want to do, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:24]** Nico's just going to look over at him, shake his head, and he's going to take his guns and he's going to shoot at the thingy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:27]** He's going to do another full action shot.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:27]** Okay.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:27]** All right.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** Give me your rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:36]** That's a 16 on the first shot and a 18 on the second shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:36]** Both hit.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:37]** Nicely done.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:43]** Now that it's close here, those sharpshooter skills of yours are getting better and better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Yeah.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** How much damage?

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** That's a one on the first.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Okay.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** A two on the second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** All right.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:55]** So it's starting to look like it's getting some scoured from the magic missiles and then from the shot.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** Okay.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:58]** All right.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** You know whose turn it is.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** Kev, do you want to dispute?

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** Do you want to file a complaint?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:04]** I'm still reading.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** It's a lot.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:05]** That's fine.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** It's two big paragraphs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Nico.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** Good move.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:13]** Can I speak with the manager?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:20]** This changes your initiative count to the current initiative count for the remainder of combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** There it is.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** Bummer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** Can I delay again and move it forward?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:27]** You could delay again.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:31]** You could just delay again until the top of the next round and then come in if you want.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** But then you would lose yet another thing.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:37]** So it is the incapacitated robot's turn.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:45]** The incapacitated robot, I think, is going to go... It's trying to decide between Nico and Hears.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:49]** And I think because Hears did a bit more damage, it's going to turn.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:53]** But what's interesting is that the robot is going to keep looking...

**[00:45:53 - 00:46:00]** at Niko, but the arm on his shoulder is going to go like and swivel around and fire at Hears.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** No look.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Oh, no look.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** Does he get a disadvantage for that?

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** It's going to fire like a weapon.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** It's going to fire a weapon.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** That's not standard.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:13]** That's not standard on an incapacitator droid, right?

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:16]** I will tell you that yes, it is standard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:23]** If I show you the picture of the standard incapacitator droid, then there's also an arm on the standard one.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:24]** So I'm going to do this real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** On this model, I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:27]** On this model, it's also standard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** Okay.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:32]** So this is kind of like a subset of incapacitated robots.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:35]** That's just meant to be bipedal and be more friendly.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:37]** The other one looks like a dome.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** I'll send it to you afterwards.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** Both of them have arms on them.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** That is standard for incapacitated robots.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** You would know that.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** Okay.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:48]** So it is going to fire.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** Oh, man.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:50]** I really hope this hits.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** No shit.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Too excited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:53]** Fuck you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:56]** Critical hit.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** Critical hit.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Oh, come on.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:01]** I am stoked!

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:03]** This is how all Sunday games should be.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** Alright, my first attack.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:10]** Alright, so that is going to be... You will take...

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:14]** 14 points of non-lethal damage.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** Okay.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:32]** As this pistol, this arc of electromagnetic energy hits you, and as it hits you, your muscles kind of seize up, and you have the entangled condition as it has bound you.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** from its pistol.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:39]** So on Hero Lab, you can go in, add the entangled condition and see what it does.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:43]** It lowers your AC, makes a couple things happen

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** Oh, I'm so excited.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** Where are you at?

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:47]** What do you mean?

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:49]** Where are you at health wise here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:51]** I mean, my hit points only have 11 hit points.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** So, I mean, I guess I'm down.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** So you dipped into stamina points.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Right.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** So I have six of those.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:59]** So I'm looking at, I have like one stamina point left then.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:00]** No.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** 11 plus four.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:03]** That's like three stamina points left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:05]** You have three stamina points left.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** Woo.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** Yeah.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:07]** Wow.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** This is, this is exact.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:11]** This is going exactly as I wanted it to go.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:12]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** Start rerolling your character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** John is really excited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:23]** I wish everyone could see it, but he's just like wringing his hands out of joy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** This is just so good.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** This is going to be a good day.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:28]** Finally, I can get you starfied.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:31]** Rick19, what are you doing?

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** Oh, finally it's my turn.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:36]** Yeah, because you delayed it until after the robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** What are you doing on your turn?

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** Okay, so first he's going to move inside this box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** Yep.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** I'm in the box.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:48]** So there's not too much room, but you can kind of step over a little bit of stuff.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:53]** I'll say it's kind of, it's a bit tough.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:56]** Like if you want to move back out, you're going to lose five feet.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:58]** But if you want to stay there for cover, you can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** Okay, so then I'll start this way.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** I'm gonna proceed first.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:03]** I'm gonna look inside the box one more time.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:04]** Okay.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** I don't see anything.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:07]** Okay.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:10]** And then I'm gonna move behind the box.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** Okay.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:15]** And then I'm gonna take another shot at this thing.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:21]** So, artillery, laser, azimuth, artillery, laser.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** I'm gonna roll.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:24]** Roll strong.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** Come on.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** I got a 10 plus 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:33]** 10 plus 5 on the artillery laser, and is that against EAC or KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** KAC?

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:38]** Where does it tell you that?

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:42]** Since it's a laser pistol, I think that's EAC.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** That's a hit.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** Cool.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:44]** Yeah.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:44]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** I don't see where it tells you that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:50]** Well, it's an energy weapon, so it's not kinetic, right?

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:52]** So it's against energy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:55]** If it's not clearly laid out for me, then I just don't understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:55]** I get it.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:56]** It's okay.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:56]** All right.

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:00]** How much damage are you doing with your artillery laser attack?

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:02]** I roll a 1d10, which is this little guy.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:03]** That's insane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** And I think it's just a d10.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:09]** It's not like additional bonuses or anything.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:10]** Okay.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** Which would be nice.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:15]** I do three points of damage.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Fire type.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:29]** Three points of fire damage as this massive artillery laser just unloads several shots, sink into the back of the creature, and it's still going.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:30]** What else do you want to do with your turn?

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** That's the end of my turn.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** That's the end of your turn.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** Here's what you're doing.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:37]** You're looking a little soft there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:39]** Yeah, here's his little squishy right now.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:43]** But he is hoping that the robot will not roll a high attack again.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:44]** Okay.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:50]** And he's going to take a full action to do magic missile, so that'll be three of those.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** Three of those?

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** Wow.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** All right.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** Yeah.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:54]** Impressive.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** Most impressive.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** All right, let's try this.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:01]** So that's 11 damage.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** 11 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:07]** Wow, that is an excellent move there.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:12]** It hits the robot, and the robot takes a step forward.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:18]** As you can tell, some of its servo motor controls were definitely hit with that.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:28]** And it seems like it's starting to kind of spark, and a lot of the exterior of it really looks like it's just coated in burns and blaster marks and everything.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:28]** Yeah.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Good move.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** You want to do anything else?

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:33]** That was your full action, so you can't.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** You can't, yeah.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** Yeah, that was a rhetorical question.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** I was just testing myself.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:36]** Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:39]** O.K., what do you want to do?

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** Yes, Dr. O.K.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:47]** is going to come into the cargo hold.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:50]** Okay.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:53]** Right here, just behind cover.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:59]** I want to know if I can, so you said it was non-lethal damage that was done to Hears?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:00]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:06]** So would treat deadly wounds have any effect on his hit points?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:08]** Treat deadly wounds would.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** I think that would affect hit points regardless.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:18]** Just because he has... The only difference between the non-lethal and the lethal would be that if he goes down to zero, he doesn't necessarily die.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** You're not dying.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:23]** You're just stable but unconscious.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:26]** So the way that you heal would help regardless.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** So I'm going to do that.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:33]** And I believe it is just a medicine check.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:38]** Yeah, but can you do that from across the map, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:46]** I can, because I have my custom micro lab, as well as I can hit them with the cost jet liquidator that I have.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** What is the range on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:53]** The range is... You're looking at 55 feet from where you are.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** Ah, shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:57]** From downtown... From downtown...

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:00]** Doctor okay with the shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** Where do I need to be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:04]** I need to be here by Trostnick.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:06]** Okay.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** So I'll do that next turn.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** Thanks, man.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:17]** Can I do a medicine check on Trostnick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:20]** Yeah, you can go up and do a medicine check.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:24]** I will tell you that it will be... The range... What are you trying to do with your medicine check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:27]** Just, like, get them back up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Okay, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:35]** The range on the custom micro lab, though, I think has 120... No, never mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** Yeah, that would be crazy.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** You, like, throw your lab across the room.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** No, no.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** It's 90 feet.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:48]** Throw your, like, chemistry kit with all your Erlenmeyer flasks across the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** So I'm reading up on non-lethal damage.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** It's kind of interesting.

**[00:53:53 - 00:54:00]** So there are some weapons that deal strictly non-lethal damage, and there are weapons that deal lethal weapon, and then there's other weapons that deal either.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** You can actually swap them.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:09]** But it says that unless you have that setting, a lethal weapon can deal non-lethal damage as long as you take a negative four penalty.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** And the opposite.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:17]** If you have a non-lethal weapon, you can make it do lethal damage with a minus four penalty.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:17]** Right.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:19]** So careful, this robot could still kill us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:22]** Just saying.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:28]** And you can do more identify creatures to see what kind of weapon is that or just do an engineering check.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:31]** You know, like you can try and see what it's doing.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** Or we could just kill it.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** Or you could just kill it and look after.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** Shoot first, ask questions later.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** What are you doing, Doctor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:41]** I'm just going to do a medicine check on Trostnik.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:44]** That's going to be a treat deadly wounds if you want to do that.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:47]** And I'll do that from here.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** You know what the DC is, right?

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:52]** It's... It's not small.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:53]** What's his level?

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** I'll say that.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:58]** Uh, well, that's, that's not the question to ask.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** The question to ask is what is the DC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:05]** If you succeeded at a check, you restore one hit point per level or you are treating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Just go ahead and give me your roll.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** Give me your medicine check roll.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:11]** You get fucking natural one.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** Oh, you don't.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** So what were you trying to do?

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:15]** Were you trying to shoot?

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** So rough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:24]** Yeah, I was trying to shoot him with my, you know, willingly with my cost jet liquidator and give him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:26]** But you shot him with a drink dart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:29]** No, but it hits the ground nearby.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:31]** Dude, you just take a drink dart and judge him.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** Happy birthday to the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:35]** That's exactly what he did.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** You're crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:36]** All right.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:44]** So you shoot the cost of that liquidator into the ground and you see just this little puddle of liquid forming on the ground next to trust the deck.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** That was a good try.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:48]** Anything else you want to do with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:53]** I suppose I could try and do a check on this stupid robot.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:56]** You want to do another life science check or another engineering check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:56]** Okay.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** Identify creature.

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:58]** Give it to me.

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** Give it to me.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** Oh, 23.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:01]** 23.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:04]** Yeah, that's pretty impressive.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** What are you looking to try and know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:12]** I'm going to give you the option.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:12]** Weaponry.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Yes, what's the weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:19]** You can know that the gun is an integrated voltaic anchor pistol.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:23]** I will say that Niko in general, you would know that this is pretty common.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:27]** Again, these are incapacitator robots.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:33]** They are really sought after by clients looking to incapacitate their targets, not necessarily kill them.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:40]** So it makes sense that it has something that shoots something that can possibly bind or deal non-lethal damage.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:40]** Gotcha.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** Top of round three.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:43]** You know whose turn it is.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:46]** Old Niko Orion.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:48]** What are you doing here, party boy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:54]** Um, so Niko, um, Niko's finding it more and more strange the more they fight.

**[00:56:56 - 00:57:00]** He thinks this droid might be from actual ship security.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:01]** Okay.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** That's his hypothesis?

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:08]** He's starting to feel a little bit more certain than that.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:08]** Okay.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:17]** Uh, that being said, uh, how do I check if my weapon, my guns have a, would non-lethal damage apply to a droid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** I'll say this.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:23]** If you want to, would they apply to a droid?

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:25]** I mean, the droid will either go down or it won't.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:27]** I don't think it's necessarily going to die or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** Yeah, I just want to incapacitate it.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:37]** What I would like to do is find a way to incapacitate it with the idea of being able to understand what its last orders were and from whom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:44]** I'll tell you that you already know that even if it's, let's call it dead, which is just off, right?

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:45]** Yeah.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:48]** You can look into its computer.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:51]** You can do a computer or an engineering check whether it is dead or not.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:55]** So whether you do lethal or non-lethal damage, you will be able to find that out.

**[00:57:55 - 00:58:03]** I'll say that if you want to do non-lethal damage, what you're trying to do is trying to make it more repairable or more intact, right?

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:05]** So if you really want to do that, I'll let you do that.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:08]** You're going to keep the same minus four penalty, but that's the thinking.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:12]** You're not just blowing it to bits and it's going to be a lot to fix, right?

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:17]** It's going to be a little bit easier to fix if you leave it there.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:19]** But either way, you can see what's going on with it.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** You can look into its programming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** Okay.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:26]** But you can do non-lethal damage with a lethal weapon.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** Just take a minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** You would just get a minus four.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:34]** But at this point, I'm just going to say, like, personal suggestion, just do lethal damage.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** It's fine.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:38]** Like, you can still figure it out with lethal damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:41]** Yeah, I'm on board with all this.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** So I'm going to go ahead.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** I'm going to do lethal damage here.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:43]** Okay.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:44]** Nico's going to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:44]** Okay.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:46]** You're going to do another full action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** Yeah, another full action.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:50]** So the first one is a 12 on the dice.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:53]** Misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** Is an 18 again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** That is impressive.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:00]** So the first shot misses.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:01]** My left hand is good.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:05]** Your left hand is right hand dominant.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:07]** What are you doing damage wise with that left hand?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:12]** That's a three on the damage there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:17]** Oh, so your left hand was your cool hand, Luke?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:21]** One can say it that way, yeah.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** All right.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:22]** Nicely done.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:23]** Three damage.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:24]** Hits it.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:28]** Leaves another big mark across the front.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** This is my favorite part.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:32]** It's the incapacitated robot's turn.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:35]** It's also fun to see the crazy stuff that you guys throw at me.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** But at the end of the day, I really just want to see what will happen.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:46]** So it is going to step over and start to, like, almost lunge towards Hears.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:55]** And it's going to slam Hears and just try and, like, slam and swing its arms around Hears.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** Losing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:56 - 01:00:03]** I don't know if you guys are following on the notes, but I found a picture of Baymax hugging the kid from the movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:04]** That's awesome.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** We need to post that on social media.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:09]** You got to post that on social media.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:12]** That's what this is doing to you right now.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** Non-spoiler hug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:21]** You should just post that and be like, this picture gives away no spoilers of what happened this episode.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:24]** That is, I hate to say it, but not really.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** It's a 27.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:27]** Holy crap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:28]** Come on.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** That's crazy.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:35]** Yeah, that definitely beats my knight KC that has been reduced by entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** So here's the beautiful thing.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:40]** It goes, grabs you.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:42]** Give me a hug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:46]** Give me a hug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:47]** Not welcome.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** That is... Wow.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** No.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:53]** 13 points of damage, and you are grappled in its arms.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** Oh, my gosh.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:57]** I believe that that leaves you unconscious.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** No, it's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:02]** I mean, once you have three plus... Yeah, so I'm just knocked out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:04]** You had three stamina points left, so you're knocked out.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:08]** So it grabs you in its arms, and you just fall limp.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:09]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:11]** Good times.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** Good times.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:16]** I can check off my goal for the day.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** It is Rick's turn.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:18]** What are you doing?

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:28]** Your buddy here is stuck in the embrace, unwilling embrace, of an incapacitated robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:55]** rick reaches up and smacks the side of his head real hard because there's something wrong with the wiring um it is optical nerves or wires uh his optical nerve wires damn it it's still broken my eyes are broken uh and so he's gonna just like look around again see absolutely nothing useful and then lift his laser um azimuth laser artillery laser and shoot shoot

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:57]** And he rolls a five on that.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:59]** So a 10 to hit, that's a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:00]** Yeah.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:13]** You shoot right as the incapacitated robot grabs gears and pulls, and the shot just seems to zoom in the air where it was, where its legs were as it stabilizes itself.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** Hits the cargo next to it.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** Oh, man.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:17]** It's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:19]** Getting closer is not going to help me or anything.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:21]** It doesn't change my ability to hit.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** I'm just rolling really bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** That's okay.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:24]** You know what?

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** There are days where you don't roll.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** You know what the beautiful thing is?

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:30]** Let the die tell the story.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:35]** Sometimes if you roll and you miss, just like you said with hitting your head, that's the perfect thing.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:39]** Sometimes you have to let the dice and then make that decision about what happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:43]** The storyteller is about to get replaced if it keeps it up.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:43]** Wait, what?

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:47]** The storytelling dice is about to get replaced if it keeps it up.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:51]** Yeah, just shame the dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:51 - 01:03:19]** yeah my my nice star finder dice from you workshop here's it is it is your turn um here's what i'm gonna say i'm looking i'm pretty sure that when you're unconscious and stable uh here it is stay in the fight if you are stable and have enough resolve points or if you are knocked unconscious from non-lethal damage you can spend one roll uh resolve point at the beginning of your turn to regain one hit point

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:20]** You're no longer dying.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:23]** You immediately become conscious and can take the rest of your return as normal.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:26]** So I don't know how many result points you have, but you can spend that if you want.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** Keep in mind you're grappled.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:34]** So you will have some things that will happen because you're grappled, but you will at least be up and conscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:50]** okay so i have like five of those um i didn't use them up like getting unconscious because i thought that he had to like move through those in order to because it was not lethal it just brought you to zero and you didn't have to spend resolve points to be stable i think right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:51]** Okay.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:56]** Yeah, I don't think that, like, whatever the remaining is, like, that works from hit points to stamina points.

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:58]** When you take damage, it carries over into stamina points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:00]** Yeah, it's, like, critical effect, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:03]** Yeah, it's not the same from stamina points to resolve points.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:07]** Like, once you hit zero with stamina points, you're at zero, either dying or stable.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:15]** Then you can use your resolve points to then make, you know, you can either stabilize yourself or kind of wake yourself up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:19]** Can I do this and roll an attack or take an action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:26]** Yeah, because it says you spend one resolve point at the beginning of your turn, you regain one HP, then you can take the rest of your turn as normal.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:27]** I will do that.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:28]** You want to do that?

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:28]** Yeah.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:29]** You are grappled.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:30]** You can't move.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** You can't move out of this space, right?

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:38]** You have a minus two to AC, minus two to attack rolls, reflex saving throws, dex-based skills, and ability checks.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:44]** Accept those to either grapple the opponent or escape.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:48]** Did you say I have a minus two to attack rolls?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:48]** You do.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:49]** You do.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:51]** A minus two to AC, minus two attack rolls.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:55]** You don't have those minuses if you want to do an acrobatics check to escape.

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:57]** The acrobatics check is a standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:59]** My acrobatics is terrible.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:01]** So I think I won't attempt it.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:03]** What I'm going to just try to do is... Yeah?

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:05]** I'm going to attack his face.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:08]** So I'm going to do...

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:11]** This is not a full action, though, or it is a full action.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:14]** So I can do a full action having recovered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:17]** Yeah, you can take your turn as normal.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:21]** You can't do attacks that require two hands or you can't take actions that require two hands.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:24]** So if your full attack is attacking with both hands, you can't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:29]** I don't think that's a thing for my thing, so I think I'm good.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** All right, cool.

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:33]** I'm going to do my magic missile, and I'm going to do three of them again.

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:35]** Right in the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:35]** Right in his face.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** Where do you aim?

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:42]** Or is it like an underhanded thing taking a page from Nico's book?

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** Just being underhanded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:47]** It has to be underhanded because my arms are just stuck.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:49]** So I guess I go right up into his belly.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:52]** and just be like, get off me.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:56]** And then that's 10 damage.

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:57]** 10 damage?

**[01:05:58 - 01:05:58]** Just die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:01]** Baymax.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:08]** It hits Baymax and you can see the circuits in its face flicker.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:16]** And it seems like it is struggling to hold on as if all of its mechanical energy is just struggling to hold on.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:19]** But it is still up there.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:20]** You want to do anything else with your turn?

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:21]** I don't think I can.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:22]** That was full action.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:22]** That was awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:27]** I hope that now that he's distracted with me, though, maybe we can take him down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:28]** Okay.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:31]** Well, so you spent a resolve point, did a sweet underhanded attack.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:32]** Good turn.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:32]** Doctor okay.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:35]** You going to close this out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** You going to wrap this up?

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** I don't know.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** Maybe.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:49]** Can I roll, like, a quick perception check and see if there's, like, any other weapons around with, like... Like, what's our trust in it?

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:50]** Pack it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:53]** What's Trostenec packing?

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:53]** Okay.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:56]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:57]** Tell me what you see.

**[01:06:57 - 01:07:00]** What's my perception modifier?

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:01]** Plus three.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:03]** 19.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:04]** 19.

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:04]** Interesting.

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:05]** Interesting.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:05]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:08]** Were there any crates or anything, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:08]** Yeah.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:13]** In terms of weapons, there's nothing around you laying out that you can see in terms of weapons.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:15]** You can see that Trostenek on one side has a pistol.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:16]** That's all that you can see.

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:19]** Other than that, you can't really tell much else in terms of weapons.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:21]** There's really nothing else around you.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:22]** That was a good roll.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:24]** I can't tell what kind of pistol it is.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:28]** It seems like it's just a standard semi-auto pistol.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:29]** Tactical pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:30]** That's fine.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:31]** You rolled well.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:37]** Does it deal electrical... Is it a... Whatchamacallit...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:41]** A tactical semi-auto pistol is the tactical turn port.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:42]** So, yeah.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:46]** So, I think you would know that it doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:49]** Instead of a gun.

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:51]** Okay.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:55]** So, I'm going to move up into range and I'm just going to try and hit it.

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:59]** But I don't know that it's probably like...

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:23]** not going to like the only weapon i have the ranged weapon that i have is the cost of jet ejector and deals acid damage i don't know if it's gonna help okay it's range is 30 feet so that's perfect because are you 30 feet away thank you i want to run the you're 35 feet away okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:25]** You can just take five foot step up.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:27]** Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:27]** Okay.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:29]** Guarded step, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:29]** No.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:31]** No, I mean, I had plenty of range.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** You can take a five foot step.

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:33]** I had plenty of movement.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:36]** I have 35 movement right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:37]** Okay.

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:39]** And you're going to shoot the incapacitated robot.

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:41]** I'm going to try and get it.

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:46]** That's 16.

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:47]** 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:50]** 16 is a hit.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:50]** Nice.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:51]** Nice.

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:52]** How much damage you do?

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:54]** Could this be it?

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:55]** Could this be it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:58]** Two.

**[01:08:58 - 01:08:59]** How much damage?

**[01:08:59 - 01:09:00]** Two damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:02]** Two damage.

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:07]** You shoot and you hit the incapacitated robot in the back and you already saw sparks coming off.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:09]** You already saw that its body was like...

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:11]** struggling to mechanically hold Hears.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:20]** And as the acid hits, you see some more, like, as it sinks into the skin, and suddenly the arms let go.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:22]** Hears falls to the ground.

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:25]** The incapacitated robot is dead.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:27]** And that is our game.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:29]** Wow.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:30]** Perfect.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:31]** Well done.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:33]** Nicely done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:35]** Oh, well.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:38]** Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:41]** Hi, I'm Kelly.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:42]** I play Hears.

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:48]** Hears is an insect and therefore cold-blooded, but he does enjoy an occasional warm hug from a friend.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:54]** But that hug bot was a very unwelcome hug experience, and Hears nearly got crushed to death, so not very fun.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:59]** Also, I don't know if Nico and I should tell Rick what that shanty was all about in Episode 6.

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:02]** Maybe it's best to leave him in the dark.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:03]** That might be a lot more fun.
