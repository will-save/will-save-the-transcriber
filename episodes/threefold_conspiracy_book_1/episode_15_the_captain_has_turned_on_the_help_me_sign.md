## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:04]** Last time on We'll Save, Mystery.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:13]** The group decides to take a short rest to mull over recent events while investigating the missing security chief, Algiata.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:20]** Just when the group finds a moment of peace, the group is alerted by another individual's approach.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:27]** Grath, pilot of the Chimera and proud owner of the Yosuke tail ring.

**[00:00:27 - 00:00:33]** Nico Orion lost his cool on the Ahsoka, threatening him with violence by sticking his gun in his face.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:42]** And after a few drinks, Song bursts into the room and is terrified by the marauding space goblin gang called the New Bloods.

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:44]** How will the Avengers handle this situation?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** All right, I got to ask you a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** I don't like the sound of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:48]** Yeah.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:52]** This is the type of question you ask when you're 15 episodes in.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** Well, I don't have to answer, so.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** You don't have to answer.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:57]** No one is obliged to answer, but your answer would be great.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** Hey, stop being so confrontational.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:02]** Look, it's literally what I'm supposed to do.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:06]** I'm supposed to confront you in encounters and push you on things.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:09]** Hey, I once wrestled a giraffe to the ground with my bare hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** If that's a real story, I want to hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** Yes, please.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** Stepbrothers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** That's not it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** Stepbrothers fans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:21]** Put another coin in for Nick's obscure references.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:25]** Stepbrothers fans will know that one, hands down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Here's my question.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:33]** What if I made a steak and it was well done, like really well done, and I put ketchup on it?

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** You said you put ketchup on it?

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** And then I put ketchup.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** What if I did that?

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** What would you do?

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** What would you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** I wouldn't come to your house.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** What's the context of this?

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Is it for us or for you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** No, it's just for me.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** It's for the way that I like to do it.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** What if I did it in front of you?

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** I was like, oh, no, that's my mistake.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** It's on there for another 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** We would probably try to tell you that you shouldn't do it.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** Let you do what you want to do eventually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:00]** Yeah, I agree with Kelly, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** And then judge you secretly after the fact.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** We educate you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:06]** I would be like, cool, here's a hot dog.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** You should try this instead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:10]** I have a fairly involved story about this one.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:14]** Because I have fairly involved stories about everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Yeah, you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:18]** I'll keep it short and I'll keep it anonymous.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:31]** But I do have a friend that convinced us, and I'm sorry for listening and you know exactly who I'm talking about, but that convinced my group of friends to go to Ruth's Chris, which is a fancy...

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** Steakhouse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** Nice place.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** Good place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:39]** And the person that got us to go there then ordered a steak while done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:48]** And even the waiter was like, how long was the silence at the table after they said that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:51]** Did the whole restaurant just turn and look at you guys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:56]** Yeah, I'm pretty sure somebody hit the stop button on the music and everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:00]** Yeah, like there's a record scratch and that person's voice is like, you may be wondering how I got here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:07]** The chef came out and was like, actually, sir, we don't have to cook it well done for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:10]** We don't actually offer well done here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:14]** Did he walk back on his decision or did he go through with the well done?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** No, he went forward with it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:16]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:20]** What would you say his alignment is as a person?

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** Lawful evil or chaotic evil?

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Lawful evil.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** Lawful evil?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** No, I would just say straight up evil.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** Why would you ever do that to a Ruth Christensen?

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** Yeah, just true neutral.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:35]** I think that decision was chaotic evil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:40]** Like why on earth would you ever do that to a Ruth Chris steak?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:46]** I think that that person, if you are listening, I'm so sorry, but I do think that that person in general is like a chaotic neutral.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** Hmm.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** Hashtag judgment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:53 - 00:05:00]** I don't think it stands up to the fact that, like, when confronted, this person still insisted.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:06]** Like, wouldn't you be like, oh, you don't order a well-done steak?

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** Not if you're chaotic evil.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** If you're chaotic?

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:09]** Okay.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:09]** I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:10]** Sure.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:13]** And I just made steak last night, too, and it was beautiful.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:15]** A perfect medium.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** Burnt it to a crisp.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:17]** Okay.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** Perfect medium.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:19]** I did a great job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:22]** What would you say your alignments are?

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:26]** If you had to put a finger on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:32]** I'd say Nico Orion is pretty much chaotic neutral.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** Pretty hard.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:41]** He'll obey the laws when they're convenient for him, but if he has to bend them to get what he needs done, he'll do it.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:46]** He has no qualms about living outside if he has to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:49]** Wait, were you asking about our characters or us as people?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** I was asking about you as people.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** But you know what?

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** We haven't talked about our characters' alignments.

**[00:05:54 - 00:06:01]** So pro tip, Hero Lab, when you put in your alignment, has a great little blurb about each alignment.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:06]** So if you go to Hero Lab and you click on the alignment that you are, you can read about it.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:06]** It's really good.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Thank you, Hero Lab.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:10]** Thank you, Hero Lab and Sirenscape and Roll20 and Paizo.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** Thank you, Hero Lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:16]** When I click on it, it doesn't come up.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** Damn it, Hero Lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:25]** Hero Lab, if you need a five-second jingle for YouTube ads, then it's us.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:26]** Where is it at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** It's under profile?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:30]** It's right under your base.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:37]** When you go to profile, you go navigate character, and then to profile, that's where it tells you, because that's where you decide what you're...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** It's a cool blurb.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:42]** The writers, developers, did some good verbiage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** I'll read this one off.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:47]** This is Rick's, and I'll read it off, and you can decide what it is.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:50]** Okay, it's pretty straightforward.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:56]** You act as a good person is expected by a society to act.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** You're honorable and compassionate.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:01]** You keep your word and you fight injustice in a disciplined fashion.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:09]** You believe that rules and structure are necessary for a healthy society, but only if they help people do the right thing.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:15]** Other alignments may see you as simplistic and valuing ideological purity over progress.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** Lawful good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:17]** Lawful good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:19]** Yeah, Rick is definitely a lawful good character.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** I'll read mine.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:25]** Unpredictable and often follow their own personal code without a care for others.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:29]** They are often selfish and the only thing predictable about them is their unpredictable natures.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** Even so, they still have a limit they do not cross.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:37]** Commonly found among anti-heroes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** Chaotic neutral?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** That's just like Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:45]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** Correct.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** What about you, Dr. Okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:53]** Dr. Okay, do you want me to read the description?

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** Sure.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:55]** Yeah.

**[00:07:55 - 00:08:03]** You follow a code and don't willingly break it, whether that's societal law or a personal ethos.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:10]** You feel that order and organization are the only things holding society together.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:15]** And while you believe in authority, you don't confuse it with morality.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** The system may hurt as well as help.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:21]** But it's better than no system at all.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:27]** Others may resent your inflexibility, but at least you're dependable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:49]** is it lawful neutral lawful neutral yeah there it is and thanks hero lab but it's also the same thing in the core rule book on page 24 if you're curious it does yeah that's where they go yeah yeah because puzzle so way to go so i was wrong for nikos nikos isn't uh chaotic neutral he's how dare you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** He's just true neutral?

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** He's just true neutral.

**[00:08:52 - 00:09:01]** You may hold an aloof philosophical commitment to balance and neutrality, but more likely you simply don't hold any particular inclinations toward other alignments.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:06]** You likely prefer good to evil, but don't go out of your way to uphold it.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:13]** You act in your own self-interest and may be keenly aware that the universe considers mortal beliefs to be irrelevant.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:23]** Non-sentient creatures are always considered neutral as they lack the self-awareness to make informed choices and simply act on instinct or programming.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:25]** So you're saying, is Niko self-aware?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:28]** No, Niko's non-sentient.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:32]** Yeah, non-sentient.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:36]** That's just a comment on non-sentient creatures.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:39]** I just act in my own self-interest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:46]** Which is an interesting thing that you are in a party with lawful and chaotic good and neutral people.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:50]** And that your friend is the chaotic neutral character.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:55]** And so it's interesting to see what you may learn or what others may learn from you.


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Indeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:02]** I'm just going to go back to myself, though.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:08]** I think in my real world, I try to be a neutral good.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** Can you do that?

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:14]** And you can define that however you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:19]** So, like, you try to do good things, but not according to law.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:22]** I do what I think is right, but it's not necessarily by the rules.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:25]** I'd say that might be me, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** Got it.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** Got it.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:30]** I'd say I'm chaotic good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:33]** Yeah, I agree with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** That's how I'd describe myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:38]** Nick?

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:44]** I think I categorize myself as chaotic good just in regular everyday society.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** Okay.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:56]** Just because, I mean, if it's, what, if it's midnight or 1 o'clock and I don't see any cars coming both ways and the stop sign says... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** Plead the fifth, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** You're a rebel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Don't incriminate yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** Yeah, watch out, man.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:06]** The FBI surveillance van is monitoring this recording, so I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** And NSA is listening to this Zoom meeting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** Yeah, they're in.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** I see them in the meeting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:14]** How many watch lists do you think you guys are on?

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** As many as you will.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** How many as you will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:22]** And with that, let's go to the Starfinder universe.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** That reminds me of another joke.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:25]** That reminds me of another joke.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:30]** That reminds me of the time that I said, you all need to roll for some initiative.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Oh, yeah!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** Hold on.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** We're going around.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** That was impressive, but we're going around.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** Oh, it gets even better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** All right.

**[00:11:45 - 00:12:02]** You walk around the corner and see four space goblins tearing up the corridor, ripping the interior apart, looking, pushing each other, frantically devouring the ship, it seems like.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:05]** And when they see you, they shout...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:08]** No one will stop the nooblads!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:11]** And they attack you.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:14]** Who got a 20 or above?

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** I did.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** Oh, two people.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** What?

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:20]** Yeah.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** Pros over here.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:25]** What'd you get?

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:25]** What'd you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** What'd you get?

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** Yeah, so good.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** I got a 21.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:34]** Kev, what'd you get?

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:39]** I rolled a natural 20 with my plus 8, so I rolled a 28.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** Holy cow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:43]** I thought I was just flexing on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** Damn it.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** Wow, that is outrageous.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:47]** That is outrageous.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:48]** Anybody 15 to 20?

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:51]** 10 to 15?

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:55]** 5 to 10?

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:57]** Plus 8 initiative?

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:59]** Yeah, we talked about this before.

**[00:12:59 - 00:12:59]** One to five.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:00]** I got a four.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:02]** Oh, my goodness.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:05]** I didn't think I'd go to the bottom of the barrel for this.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** So, Nico got a four.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** What about you, Doctor?

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:09]** I got a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:13]** The crazy thing, it makes sense because look at how our stance is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:16]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:19]** Doctor, okay, rolled a natural two.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** So, what's your total, Doctor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** Three.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:24]** Three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:32]** So just so our listeners know, we're standing against this hallway on a corner edge, and Rick is the one up against the wall that he tried to peek around.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:37]** So it's Rick and Hears on the front, and then you have the other players in the back.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:39]** It really makes sense.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:41]** Serendipitous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** It is serendipitous.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:44]** Indeed.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:47]** Well, I think we all know who goes first at the top of round one.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:49]** What are you doing, Rick19?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:54]** So Rick is going to step out.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Oh, no.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** Sorry.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:57]** Hold on.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:59]** I had to reload.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:22]** oh the energy i know draining he's gonna step out strong start lift his artillery uh asthma laser this cannon and he's gonna look at the goblins and say i suggest you stop what you're doing and then he is going to hold an action okay i have to look this up i forget how the characters start and remind me of robocop

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** Oh, now you know he's lawful good.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:27]** He's got to be a cop, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:33]** No, I'm just saying, like, I saw a meme this morning of, like, RoboCop.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:40]** And I was just like, now that you say, the thing that triggered it for me was just like, I suggest you stop what you're doing right now.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:43]** And what I completed in my head was like, citizen.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** And...

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:48]** I was just like, is this RoboCop?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:51]** Susan, do you want to delay or ready an action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** I'm trying to look.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** What's the difference?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:57]** You delay until other characters have taken their turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:01]** Wait, I have to be careful because last time I did this, it moved me in my initiative and I don't want to do that.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:05]** So I'm going to ready an action because delay...

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:20]** uh for the remainder of combat this changes your initiative uh count to the current initiative count for the remainder of conduct of combat so i'm gonna ready in action and i'm gonna ready to shoot uh if they make any kind of violent movements


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** Okay.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:34]** So once they make a violent movement, and note here, if the readied action is not a purely defensive action, such as shooting a foe if he shoots at you, it takes place immediately after the triggering event.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:35]** Okay.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Got it.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:40]** So you are readying in action if they take any violent thing.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** I realized I didn't show you all what they look like.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:45]** So I want to show you a quick snippet of what they look like.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** Boom.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:49]** They are.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** Yeah.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:50]** Yeah.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:52]** It's like they are.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:58]** They just have this sense of everything that they wear or own or use is like cobbled together.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:01]** They're quite the tinkerers.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** They look very small.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** So they're about three or four feet tall.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:07]** They're very skinny and have large heads with long, pointy ears.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:13]** You would almost say that they look like an evil version of a well-known character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** Paizo's got some great artwork.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** Yeah, most of the weight is in their head.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:20]** So you can see their body being very thin, but their head is huge.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** And they got some cool pirate earrings, too.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:25]** Here, speaking of pirates, what are you doing?

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** It's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:48]** um here's sees that rick is uh just preparing to like see what they'll do so he knows that maybe he's gonna try to talk them down so he's just gonna ready his uh i think he also has a azimuth artillery laser isn't that right your cryo one you're gonna use the new gun you got the new gun what did you call it john

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** The ice carbine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** Ice.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** That's the other word I was looking for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:56]** He raises the ice carbine.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** Sub-zero ice carbine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** He raises the ice carbine.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:03]** Sub-zero ice.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** And he will shoot when Rick takes a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** Okay.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:11]** And he thinks he's more like Detroit become human than Robocop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Okay.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:16]** So he's also holding.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** He's also readying in action.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** Yes.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:23]** Okay, against which, by the way, which goblin?

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:25]** The one on the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** Right in front of me.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:30]** Yeah, the one right in front of me would be the one on the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:32]** Okay, all right, cool.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:49]** All right, well, funny enough, it is their turn, and the one that is immediately in front of Hears turns, and having seen Hears around the corner, just goes, Never!

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:55]** and pulls out this really junky-looking laser and shoots it.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:00]** What is your EAC, Hears?

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:00]** It is eight.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:01]** Eight?

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Your EAC is eight?

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** My EAC is eight.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** All right.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:13]** That's going to be a hit as this gun goes like and like can barely seem to hold itself.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:21]** And it fires a laser and you take that is two points of damage as this hits your leg.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** Wait, Rick, you had it against the one in front of you.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** Here's you had the ready action as one in front of you.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** So now here's you get to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** Well, here's shoots him in the face.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:33]** Okay.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** And that will be.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** Against EAC?

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** Yes.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** Yeah.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:37]** Yeah.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:38]** Yeah.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:39]** It's a 19.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:41]** Oh, that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** Wow.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:46]** And it's 1d8 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** Oh, my goodness.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:47]** This is dangerous.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:50]** That actually would make a pretty good Q. I'm going to work on that.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** Dangerous.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** Dangerous.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** It's 4 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:55]** But let's not forget that I am not proficient.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** So I take a, it's like minus 4 to hit, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:59]** Oh, to your attack roll.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** So it's a 15, right?

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** You still hit.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** So it's 4 damage.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:03]** Wow.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:04]** Okay.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:07]** Yeah, that hits the goblin.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:15]** And then the goblin kind of smiles and is like... And, like, as blood starts to come out of the goblin's mouth.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** What a psycho.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:26]** They are psychos because the one next to you levels another unsteady laser at Rick.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** And that...

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:33]** is a critical failure.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** Yes!

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** That's what I'm talking about.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** Nice.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:36]** Wow.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** So this is interesting.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:44]** You see the space goblin

**[00:19:44 - 00:20:14]** oh wow you see the space goblin pull out the gun point it and pulls the trigger and then you hear this like and the energy in the gun like light seems to come out through the seams of the gun as if it's going to explode and the goblin hits the gun and it goes and then all the energy comes back down it looked like the gun was literally unstable and about to explode that is insane and I believe it is your turn now Rick


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:34]** yes it is so rick is then gonna roll with a it's my d20 make sure it's a d20 he's gonna roll a blast this thing with blast it azimuth artillery laser cannon laser oh i got a five it's a plus 10 or sorry it's a 10 to hit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** It's a 10 to hit.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** That does not hit.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:40]** It hits the wall next to it, and chunks of the wall fly off onto the ground.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** You were close.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** You were close.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** But no cigar.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:47]** But no cigar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:54]** Rick is then going to turn to Hears, who's kind of closest to him, and say, I only have three more shots of this artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:56 - 00:21:01]** Hears gets the implication and knows that he's pretty shite with this gun.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:05]** So he just kind of says, here you go, and tosses it to him.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:07]** Sweet.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** The Ice Carbine Sub-Zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** Okay, let's... Yeah, I'll say...

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:27]** on your turn rick you'll have to use that as a move action to like catch it okay that makes sense like it's fine for here's to be like here you go but then now here's gonna need to pull a gun on here's the turn rick you're gonna need to catch the gun on your turn does that make sense


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:30]** Sounds good, so we'll just remember that when we get to it.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:32]** But I'm a goldfish, so you're going to have to remind me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:34]** Don't worry, I got you, I got you, I got you.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:50]** And then at that point, there's another goblin that runs up, and having seen that Hears was hit, is going to level their unstable laser in between and shoot at Hears.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:55]** Let's see what happens, Hears.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** I think I hit my boom.

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:00]** That is a 16 against your EAC, which I believe hits.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** Yes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:01]** Yes.

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:05]** Does he have to take partial cover or something like shooting between those two guys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:10]** I'm going to say because he's right there and they're small, I don't think so.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** Okay.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** That hits.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:12]** How much damage?

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:14]** That's one point of damage.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:17]** One point of damage.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:21]** And then the other one runs up and also aims at you, Hears.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Oh, come on.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** 5,000 cuts.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** That is 11.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** He does your weak.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** That hits.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:31]** That is four points of damage.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** What are you at now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** Well, all right.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** So stamina goes first, right?

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** So I use all that up.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:41]** Now I'm down to my, I have 10 out of 11 hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:41]** Oh, wow.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:42]** Okay.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:42]** All right.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** All right.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** Ooh, things are getting hairy already.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** You know whose turn it is?

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:49]** Oh, my boy, Graff.

**[00:22:49 - 00:23:19]** graph runs up pushes through and and like leans around between you here's and rick and just goes die and then fires and i believe that is a hit from our good buddy graph oh yeah yeah that's a 20 to hit and i'm like playing against myself here and that is the one that is uh he's probably gonna shoot first at this one

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:49]** that's on the left so he runs around pulls out the azimuth laser pistol which he had out shoots at the space goblin on the left and that goblin gets hit in the face and falls dead good I believe it is Nico's turn next what are you doing can I move here John without having to without giving the goblins cover and shoot or do I have to get in front of them I'll say because you're right there you can probably get a clear line of sight


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:49]** All right.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:51]** So I'll just run.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** Okay, you run there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:53 - 00:24:01]** Nico, seeing as though he had his two blasters out, he doesn't have to do any type of action to kind of draw them.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:06]** What he's going to do at this point is he's going to roll two attacks to hit this goblin right here.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** Okay.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:12]** Firing at a minus three each.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:16]** No, zero because I have a plus three.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:17]** The first one is a 14.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** That hits.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** All right, and the second?

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** Second one is a 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:26]** That also hits.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:30]** Roll your damage on that goblin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:33]** What's the difference between a goon and a goblin?

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** John, the first one's a four.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:36]** Okay.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:37]** What's the second one?

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:39]** One.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** The second one's a two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:45]** Oh, it falls to the ground dead.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:54]** And as it does, it falls and it's just like, like a crazy psycho goblin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:54 - 00:25:01]** Nico says as he shoots him, he's just like, okay, who wants to die first?

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** Well, that one clearly died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:03]** Dr.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** O.K., what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** It's your turn.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:06]** Dr.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** O.K.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:11]** 's, well, it's very crowded.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:14]** You four have crowded in, yes.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:19]** There are three goblins remaining.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** Two.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:20]** Two?

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** You can see.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:21]** Okay, two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Yeah, you step in front of Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:27]** Yeah, so I'm going to step in front of Rick and...

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:31]** I'm thinking I'm just going to shoot at one of them.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:38]** I mean, there's no reasoning with these goblins, it appears.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** Well, we might be able to question one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** Did you have a gun out?

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:45]** I thought you had your injection thing out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:45]** I did.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:48]** I'm going to put it away and bring out the gun, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:50]** That's a move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** Yeah, I think that's your move, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** Unless you have a bonus, something bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** Do you have a plus one bonus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:56 - 00:26:24]** to what I don't think you do to your attack I mean I have a ranged attack plus one uh no I think it's your proficiency or not proficiency it's like if your base attack bonus is plus one yeah I have plus zero so I don't do anything then I'm just gonna say I'm gonna as a swift action I'm going to move in front of Rick uh-huh and I'm gonna slime this part of the floor


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** Okay.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** So gross.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** That's very gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:33]** You're like, oh, gross.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** That's how it sounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** Oh, gosh.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:38]** Okay, so you slime the square in front of you is what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:38]** Yes.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** Try and cross that without slipping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:43]** Oh, my goodness.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** All right.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:48]** Nico starts chuckling out to himself, and he kind of calls out to here.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:51]** He's just like, hey, here's I got a joke.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** You ready for it?

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** I'm so ready.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:56]** What would happen if Nashara wore underpants?

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** What, what?

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:04]** He would make an inky in his underpants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** I don't get it.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** That's all right.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** That's all right.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** Not bad.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:15]** I'm sorry, but I do not understand your joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:17]** It's the top of round two.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** It's the top of round two.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** It hears it is your turn.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** What are you doing?

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** Say again?

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:28]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Why is it here's turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:35]** So when you do ready in action, your initiative moves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** No, that's delay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:37]** Yes, it does.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** No, that's when you ready in action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:42]** No, I specifically said I wasn't going to.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:45]** Ready says, now I'm going to argue this.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:45]** Hold on.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:47]** That's fine.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:49]** Because here's also ready in action.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:55]** This changes your initiative count to the current initiative count for the remainder of the combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** Is that delay or ready?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** Ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** What the F?

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** It's in both of them?

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** Then I'm never going to do that again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** Wow.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:04]** This is the second time that you've done that where it's gone through.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:04]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:06]** What the F, man?

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** Who wrote this?

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** One of them should have a benefit over the other.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** What's the point?

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:13]** What's the difference between delay and ready in action then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** Ready in action just gives you a trigger.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:19]** Delay in action just allows you to go later after you see what everyone does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:23]** Yeah, you have to decide what you're going to do when you ready in action.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:28]** But when you delay, you still have that autonomy to make that choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:30]** I guess it doesn't make sense.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:33]** The ready in action shouldn't change your initiative order.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** One of them shouldn't change your initiative order.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:38]** I think the change of initiative order is kind of silly.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** Silly and frustrating.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** I'm never going to ready in it.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:43]** I'm just going to shoot first time every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:49]** Listeners, if you agree or disagree, please tell us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:52]** I know I'm trying to be awful good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** Rules don't let me.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** You love the rules, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** That's the thing about being awful.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** You gotta love those rules.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** The rules suck sometimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:01]** Yeah, but you gotta abide by them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:05]** But that just defeats the entire purpose of having a high initiative at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:07]** Well, that's the risk you take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** Okay.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** Here, it's still your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:17]** I'm going to leave that silence in there.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** Here, it's still your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** Kev has nothing to say.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:21]** Kev is mad.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** As terrible as these things are, they're really annoying.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** We probably got to leave one alive.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** They might have been planted.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:32]** There's a lot of manipulation going on here, so I'm going to kill one of them.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:33]** Let's keep the other one alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:40]** And he just, like, shoots a magic missile at the face of the one right behind the dead one in front of him on the left.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:41]** Damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:46]** Rick replies back to you and says, there is also their leader, the Hobgoblin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** Yeah, well, we don't know what's going on with him.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** He's not here right now, is he?

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:50]** She.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** She's not here right now, is she?

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:52]** All right.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** Okay, so.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:57]** What's your magic missile damage?

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:00]** It is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:05]** One, two, three, four.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:06]** I'm sorry.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:06]** Five.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** One, two, three, four.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** Okay.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:10]** All right.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:10]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** There it is.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** All right.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** All right.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Here we go.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** 2D4 plus one.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:14]** Wow.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:14]** Okay.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:15]** Ridiculous.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** 2D4 plus one.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** All right.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** All right.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** I'll cover.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** Okay.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** All right.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** Six.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Six damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Wow.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:22]** Six.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:27]** Smashes the goblin whose face is burned off and falls immediately dead.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:31]** You all are making short work of them.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** Hey, Rick, it's your turn.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** Unless Hears wanted to do anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:37]** Hears has successfully tossed the gun to Rick at this point.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:38]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** Rick just quits.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:43]** He walks away.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** I'll road a hit.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** With the ice carbine?

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** I got a six.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** No, with the artillery.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** So the carbine.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:51]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:53]** You want to roll to catch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:55]** Uh, I'll say, sure.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:55]** Why not?

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:55]** Why not?

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:56]** Why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:56]** Okay.

**[00:30:57 - 00:31:00]** So wait, I rolled a six for the fire, which is sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Acrobatics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** Yeah.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** So it's going to be a 11 to hit.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** I don't want to cheat and like reroll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** So, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** So it's an 11 to hit.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** Yeah, that hits.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Okay, cool.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** Um, and I'm going to roll a strength check.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** He said,

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:32]** uh i'll say acrobatics acrobatics yeah because like you're trying to shoot with a cannon and also catch a natural 20 sad like wow like a complete badass with style with a flourish like you you toss the gun over and he just he switches it around and like cocks it and flips it onto his shoulder impressive and how much damage did you do to the goblin

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:33]** I don't know.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** I didn't roll it yet.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:34]** Okay.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** That's a D10 though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** Oh my goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:38]** Four points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** All right.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:49]** Four points of damage to that goblin that literally like you feel the air around you just like sizzle with the heat of that shot.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:53]** And that goblin looks pretty close to dead.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:56]** But it is that goblin's turn.

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:03]** And even there's blood coming down from the goblin's face as almost half of it is just charred.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:09]** It just kind of slowly goes like, Jintoroga's taking the bridge.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:12]** Jintoroga will kill you.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:14]** Jintoroga's taking the bridge.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:17]** Jintoroga will kill you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:21]** And then takes out a laser pistol and fires it at Hears.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:23]** They ain't dummies.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:26]** That is a 19 to hit.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:29]** Yeah.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:32]** Two points of damage to you.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:35]** It is Grath's turn next.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:45]** Grath starts to aim down at the goblin and then looks at Nico and looks at the four of you and says, what do you guys want to do here?

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** We got this one left.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** And he's going to delay his turn.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:50]** It is whose turn is next?

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** I believe it is Nico.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** I say we keep it alive.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:56]** Yeah, that's what Nico's going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** I completely agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:00]** So Nico isn't going to shoot with two blasters.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:03]** He's going to hear... It was Griff who said this, right?

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:27]** graph graph asset yeah he goes what do you want to do nico's gonna look over at graph and he's just gonna with kind of like a smug look on his face he's gonna say watch this and nico kind of lowers his arm with one blaster and he kind of levels the other one and looks as though he's really really focusing hard to take one shot right

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:54]** okay all right so he's gonna nico's only gonna shoot with one so it eliminates the dc and what nico's gonna try to do he's gonna try and kneecap this last goblin here so and you're gonna do non-lethal damage yeah non-lethal damage and he's gonna shoot with one blaster so non-lethal is a minus what four minus four okay so it's a my yeah okay so you level it that's super cool

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** 18 on the roll.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** So 17 total.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** 18, that is a hit.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** Yeah, that's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:03]** Three damage.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** Three damage.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:14]** And that goblin, as like their knee just explodes and they fall onto the ground, it seems like.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:18]** And they seem to fall unconscious.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:23]** But you do successfully take them out.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** You non-lethally killed them.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** You non-lethally killed them.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:32]** Nico also just kind of laughs himself like, that's funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:47]** Uh, so Rick is going to then like drop his, uh, he's got his, uh, azimuth laser, artillery laser, uh, on a strap underneath his trench coat and he just drops it and it flings back behind him underneath his trench coat.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:57]** And now he's got the cryo, um, rifle in his other hand and he's going to charge forward and pass the slime through Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:57]** Slime.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** Do you want me to roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:59 - 00:34:59]** No, he'll run around it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** Okay.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** He doesn't step in Dr. Okay Slime.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** And then he's going to run down the hallway.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:07]** Yeah.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:11]** And then he's going to tie up the goblin.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** Okay.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:15]** It's going to be very tactical.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:25]** He charges forward and he can kick the goblin over onto its stomach and then put a knee onto its back and then grab its arms and tie them together.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:30]** You all are out of combat now.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:30]** Wait a minute.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** No other goblin moves.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:34]** Grath starts to walk up.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** What are you all doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** I'm going to see what Song's up to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:52]** Nico's gonna walk over to the one that he kneecapped, and with his foot, he's just gonna move the goblin's helmet over to expose the other side of his cheek, just to make sure that the goblin is still breathing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:57]** Yeah, the goblin is down, unconscious, but stable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:00]** He attempts to smack the goblin awake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:03]** Okay.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** Before we get to that, Dr.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** O.K., you walk over to Song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:10]** Yes, I'm going to ask Song to join us.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:13]** It seems the danger is abated and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:14]** Are they done?

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** They're gone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** It's okay?

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:17]** Come with us.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:21]** We may have some questions that you could fill in.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** The blanks.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** And Song starts to walk up.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:36]** Can we just forget about that little... I got very afraid, but I do have a reputation to maintain around here.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:38]** Can we just forget that I was so terrified, if anyone asks?

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:39]** Maybe.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:43]** Roll a persuasion.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** You want me to roll a persuasion check?

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** Let's find out.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:55]** It will be a diplomacy check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:58]** What would be the DC?

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:01]** I'm sure that doesn't pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:03]** But he's trying to do a diplomacy check against you.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** So what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** I don't know.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:15]** I'm not going to stick my neck out for some salt slinging cook with cowardice.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** So what do you say?

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** So what do you say?

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:21]** I say song.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:29]** I don't... I can't really defend... I'm not your lawyer.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:34]** What you decide to do is really on you.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:45]** I can't... I will do my best, but I can't make a promise to you that this won't come back to haunt you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:51]** Song just stares at you with that flat android affectation.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:57]** And then takes a big breath and says, I'll remember that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** Unless you can tell me something.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:00]** Walks away.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:02]** You there.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:04]** Song.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** Android.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:06]** Why should I stop?

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:09]** I asked you for a favor and you did not.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** I was opening.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** I thought we were having a conversation.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** You just going to walk off?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:21]** Well, I asked you for a favor, and you didn't appreciate the favor, so I'm going to leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:27]** Because I had a clarification on my part that you're just going to walk off.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** I see how it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:34]** Here's you slap the goblin awake is what you're trying to do.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:35]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** Okay.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** Wake up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:44]** So Rick, before you go to slap him, he's going to just give you a look like, man, don't hit him.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:50]** But then he's going to just set the goblin down because he just tied them all up.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:55]** And then Rick is going to stand up and say, I believe we should get to the bridge.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** It sounds like there is an emergency.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:01]** Are you going to join us, Song, or are you going to wet yourself on the way up there?


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:09]** If he wasn't indignant towards you now, now he definitely... Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:09]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:10]** It's fine.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:13]** I'm going to remain here and clean things up.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Yeah.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:18]** Don't forget that spot on the floor, Android.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** You do that song.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:21]** And Graff looks over and says, I don't know what's going on.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:25]** There's something going on in the bridge, and I'm worried about it.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:27]** So what is your plan here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:33]** Grath, the goblin stated that Jincharoga is going to take the bridge.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:36]** Jincharoga is the hobgoblin leader of these group.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** We must go now.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:42]** And he's going to start walking down that hall towards the... Sorry.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:46]** I'm going to roll a knowledge check on what direction we need to go.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** Do we have to go back up?

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** There's a stairwell over towards us, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** There is a stairwell right near you.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:54]** So you did or you did not wake up the goblin?

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** I thought we woke him up.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** Rick did not.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** You did or you did not?

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** Let's clear that up first.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Let's find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:03]** I attempted to, and then Rick brought up a pretty good point that we should just go.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:07]** So, yeah, I followed through with the slap because he didn't catch me in time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:16]** The goblin kind of wakes up a little bit and starts to open their big eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** Nico kind of looks back at him.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** He's like, you're going to die.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** Oh, you're back with us.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** Good to see you.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** Nico says, oh, you're back.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** Welcome back to hell.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** Good to see you, buddy.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:30]** Good to see you.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:34]** Now, let me make something very clear right here.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:37]** You have a shattered kneecap, courtesy of me.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** I shot your kneecap.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:39]** Thank you.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** You're welcome.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:43]** Now, let me tell you how this is going to go.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:47]** You're going to tell me how many of your compatriots are storming the bridge, right?

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** And I'm not going to put a bolt between your eyes.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:57]** If you don't, then your existence is going to come to a climactic and sudden end.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:02]** There will be black, black, black, nothing for you.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Do you understand me?

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:07]** And he's going to roll an intimidation check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:08]** Roll it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:11]** Oh, boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:18]** 18 plus the intimidation, which I think is plus six, but I will double check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:19]** Yeah, double check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** 18 plus six.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Yeah, plus six.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** That's a 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:31]** She's going to kill you.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:36]** But there is something here.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:40]** If you want it before you die.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:46]** There is a map.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:52]** There is a map over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:58]** And points to one of the other dead goblin bodies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** He goes to that body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:04]** Nico continues to... And fishes it out.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:07]** Nico's just like, who is she?

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:11]** And if you tell me, I'll make your death painless.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** Judgeroga!

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** Judgeroga!

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:19]** She's talking to... Do you not know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** She's going to kill you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:44]** ginger i will kill you that's the hobgoblin nico finally just shoots the thing in the head dies nico's just like had enough here's you walk over to a body and it's uh it's the body that is right in front of you in front of the doors here

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:54]** And when you reach down, you reach into the pockets of one of the goblin of that goblin and you pull out a pillowcase.

**[00:42:57 - 00:43:05]** And the pillowcase on it seems to be like scribbled in black ink.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:08]** I'll put it in your journal soon enough.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:23]** In some of what appears to be the rough outline of the ship, there are some X's and question marks and a couple areas circled.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** One of the areas is right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:29]** So they were looting the ship, it seems.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** What do you think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** Where was that X?

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:38]** This one area where we took them down, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:44]** Yeah, so there's an X in the area that you're at now, and there are a couple other Xs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:48]** And all the Xs appear the same on the sheet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** Yeah, it's pretty hastily scribbled.

**[00:43:52 - 00:44:06]** It's at that point that you're standing there, and you look and see this map, and then there is this, like... And it's the intercom coming in and out, and you hear, like...

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** We must go now.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:18]** And then you hear a voice that is unmistakably Captain Ramin saying, Get off my bridge!

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:21]** And it cuts out.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:21]** Silent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:25]** Where is the access to the... Is it this ladder wall here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:29]** Okay, so Rick is already at that ladder wall and he's going to go up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:30]** Okay.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** Nico's going to be close up behind him.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:35]** He's like, gosh, I've been looking forward to this one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:41]** I am going to ready my blaster and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** And you all should pop up around.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** Hold on one sec.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:31]** I mean, I got to read up on this more, but I'm looking at the description of the ice carbine, and it's got a hardness level and hit points.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** So you can damage weapons?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** Yeah, 100%.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:34]** Yeah.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:40]** So you all are... Sorry, how do I do that?

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Can I just target a weapon?

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** Yeah.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:48]** Do I need to be like... Do I get a bonus or a penalty?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** We can look at the rules for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:53]** I thought we were on the bridge level when we were at the crew quarters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:57]** And then we went back down to fight the goblins.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:57]** Yeah.

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:00]** So now we have to go back up to the bridge level.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** What is this here?

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** Straight down the hallway, kind of in the corner.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Just part of the bulkhead.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:05]** Okay.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:10]** So then as we come up the ladder, well, Rick is going to just kind of take charge.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:13]** He's got his carbine out, and he's strafing the wall.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** Okay.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:16]** How did you get all the way over there, Doctor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:18]** I ran really fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:22]** Okay, so let's take this as it happens.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** You start coming up.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** You start running down.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** You're in the corner there.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** Are you still in the corner?

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:27]** Yeah.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:28]** Yeah.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:30]** Okay.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** Nico, you're going to go the other way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:32]** Oh, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:35]** You came up these here.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** Came up these ladders here.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:37]** Sorry.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** You're going up towards the bridge.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** Okay.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** Okay, wait.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** I'm sorry.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** Who is moving first?

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:44]** Because I was the first one up the ladder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:45]** Yep.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:48]** So you're probably at the door first, Rick.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** Okay.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:52]** As you approach, Grath walks up behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:57]** I'm going to ready, by the way, a booster for myself.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:03]** Can I hold an action before combat starts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:06]** It's going to change your initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:10]** But I don't want to do it when I'm not in combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** Yeah, I'll agree to that.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** Rick is going to...

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:39]** stand in front of the doors and have his rifle up in the same aspect and this would be like a surprise round type move right so here's the thing about surprise rounds if you open the door and they are unaware of you you will be in a surprise round so that's the thing is that you're gonna have to roll a stealth check to an opening door so but like what if i have my gun up and ready is there does that do anything for us not really i mean you're just ready to take a shot


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:43]** you're not going to get any bonuses from having your gun ready when your gun's ready.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:46]** Like the, the role is to see if you hit the role.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** Isn't to see, are you ready?

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** Are you aiming necessarily?

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:49]** Right.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:53]** So I don't think you can necessarily get any bonuses from being ready.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:53]** I would say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** Whatever.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Let's just go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** Well, no, I mean, what did you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:10]** I wanted to, I wanted, if, if we get into combat right away before combat starts, I wanted to hit myself with a basic booster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:15]** Oh, why don't you just... Because it lasts for only a certain amount of rounds.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** That's fine.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:22]** If whenever you decide that you're about to go in, I will allow you to use that.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:26]** Before... So out of combat, basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:33]** Yeah, but if we do that and then you all are talking for a bit, then I'm going to say it's going to wear off.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:36]** So you're going to have to go into combat pretty quickly.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** That's all.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** That's fine.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** Totally...

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** Totally cool.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:51]** So as you walk up the door, the door doesn't open immediately, and Grath walks up behind you and says, Guys, I don't... I mean, it sounds like Ginger Oak is in there.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:54]** Something's going on, but we need to make sure that we're careful here.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:58]** The door's not going to open unless I use this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:59 - 00:48:59]** Do you...

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:01]** You know the layout, Grath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** I do.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:06]** It's like an octagonal shape.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** Captain's right in the middle.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:11]** A couple of stations at some corners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:13]** Seems like a tactical hairball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** It's a hairball indeed.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** You must get a lot of hairballs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:22]** Yes, it sticks to my slime quite easily.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** It's very hard to get out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:28]** I think we're friends because I also get a lot of hairballs, so that's fine.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** All right, guys.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** Yeah, we get it.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** You're both gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** So what are we going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** You're not my friend here anymore.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:38]** No more moonshine.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** He says, look, I've got this.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** And he pulls out the key.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:46]** As soon as I touch this, the door is going to open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:58]** so we need to be ready uh nico's gonna walk up behind uh he's gonna walk up behind graph he's gonna be like okay the moment you open the door then get out of the way i'm gonna just shoot i'm

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:03]** Nico's going to look over at Rick and he's going to be like, Rick, what do you got for this situation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:10]** I have the same guns that I've been using for the last several fights that we have been in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:10]** Hey, I'm sorry.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** I'm sorry.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** I'm sorry, Robocop.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:20]** I'm just trying to figure out if you got some other programming or something you haven't shown us yet that you'd like to use to wow us in this moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** Nick, roll a listening check.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:25]** I'm just being a douche.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** I'm being a douche.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:31]** Not all androids have some kind of special programming, as you say.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** Jesus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:34]** Not all androids are sarcastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:42]** Hey, not to mention seeing as though my company built, like, robocops and droids and cyborgs to begin with, like, and androids.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** That's a fair question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:45 - 00:51:09]** except in this world we don't exactly understand how how androids come about like there's a whole mythos about whether or not they're created or you know kind of born so just because you build robots doesn't mean you know androids true but i mean it's still a fair question so play it as you would normally play it kev no that was that was it like he okay he would just give you a blank stare okay

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** Because it's almost offensive to ask.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** It's like, well, you got any kind of special programming?

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:19]** Like, it's almost racist to assume that an android has some kind of special ability just because they're an android.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** So, Nico, I'm going to move out of the way.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** So I'm going to open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** Yeah.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:26]** So open the door, move out of the way, and I'm taking first shot.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:28]** Anybody else coming after?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:31]** I suggest we all take cover.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:34]** Otherwise, you are putting yourself in a line of fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:38]** So Graf is going to stand next to Hears, and he's going to have his key card ready.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:41]** Hears is standing right in front of where the key card would be, but he's going to reach over.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** Nico and Dr. O.K.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:49]** are standing right in front of the doors, five feet back, and Rick is on the other side of Hears, the side of the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** I'm ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** Well, I'm ready to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:52]** I'm ready.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** You guys are ready.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:56]** I think you guys should be standing in front of the open doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** You're going to get shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:03]** Okay, so Will, you're going to take the booster and get it for four rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:07]** Yeah, three rounds, but it's fine.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** Oh, I thought you said four.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:15]** I read it wrong as three rounds, and then I read plus one as something else, but it's three rounds.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** This is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:24]** Hey, Nico, you want to... You're really going to be right there, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** Just for the first round there, here's... Don't worry about me.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** I got one or two tricks up my sleeve.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** All right, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:35]** I got some, and he looks over at Rick.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:35]** Fucking open it.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Some special programming.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** All right, Rack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:41]** I mean, yeah, not Rack Guy.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** Can you open it up?

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** Grath Guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Grath Guy.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:49]** Grath nods, despite the abuse.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** I took it back.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:56]** And takes the card out.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:04]** You can tell Grath, calm, measured, despite the tension of opening up the bridge to see what's going on.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:22]** As Grath reaches up, and the card is recognized by the controller, and you hear like, ba-doo, and the sound of the controller starts to slow down, and the door, you hear like, shh.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:33]** And to the four of you, the sound of the door opening seems to be incredibly slow.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:36]** Time seems to almost slow down.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:40]** And the sound of the door is like moving slowly.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** through the air.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:51]** But none of you really hear it as all of you begin experiencing like these slight flashes of events.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:57]** It's like a little bewildering, like the sound of the door opening in Algiata, the...

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:05]** The sound of the pistol, the casting of the spell, like random phrases from conversations seem to all like start to pepper your vision.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:15]** And these flashes over the last few days, they like sprinkle into your brain as the world suddenly starts to speed back up.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:22]** And as it starts to speed back up and the door starts to open, all of you are seeming to breathe heavy.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:29]** And it seems like for a split second, so much time passed by, but it was literally a millisecond.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:37]** But all of you suddenly just feel more aware of your bodies and your abilities because you're all now level two.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** That's what I'm talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:44]** You're finally level two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:50]** Just before the combat, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:52]** My goodness, I feel different.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:56]** I feel stronger than before.

**[00:54:56 - 00:55:01]** You could almost say strong for my kin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:02]** Oh, man.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:06]** Leveling up is one of my favorite parts of the game.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:12]** It allows you to develop and shape your character to fit your style of play.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:18]** Maybe you're like me and thinking about improving some skills to fit more of Dr.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:18]** O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:20]** 's persona.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** But I hear you.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** Maybe you've looked at the core rulebook.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:23]** Thanks, Paizo.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** And don't know where to begin.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** But don't fret.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:32]** There's a lot of cool resources online and tools that you can take advantage of.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:42]** You can visit our website, willsavethepodcast.com, and check out links to things like Hero Lab, which makes it easy to manage your character during gameplay.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:46]** But also compare feats and abilities with relative ease.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** In fact...

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:55]** I'm now going to leave because I'm too excited to see what additional features I've unlocked and level up Dr. K for the first time.

**[00:55:56 - 00:56:00]** Ooh, it feels like the very first time.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:11]** Tune in next week.
