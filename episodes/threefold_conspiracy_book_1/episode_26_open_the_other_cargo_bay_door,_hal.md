## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:04]** Last time on We'll Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:05]** Frustration mounts.

**[00:00:06 - 00:00:12]** As our imposter Lozu attacks our brave passengers, one thing is made clear.

**[00:00:13 - 00:00:16]** This Lozu won't make it easy on them.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:26]** Shots are fired and a grenade is thrown, but the group is forced to go through the decoys one hologram at a time.

**[00:00:27 - 00:00:30]** One of the captives tries to make a break for it,

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:32]** but is shot down by Rick-19.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:40]** Once exposed, the imposter quickly surrenders and reveals themselves to be yet another shapeshifter.

**[00:00:41 - 00:00:44]** What is this cargo that these pirates are willing to die for?

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:48]** Find out this time on Milti.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:45]** Nick, you can put your hands down.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:45]** We already clapped.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** The episode's already started.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** You're good.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:54]** You know, I hate all of you with a virulent passion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:59]** So for some reason today, when we start episodes, we go 3, 2, 1, and then we all clap.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** It helps us sync.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:03]** And today, Nick, just 3, 2, 1.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** We all clap.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** And then Nick claps.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:08]** Time after time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** I blame the latency.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:11]** We all clapped and we're ready to roll.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:13]** And then Nick puts his hands up to prepare to clap.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** I don't even know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** That's not true.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:18]** That is patently not true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:24]** This feels like the after talk show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** It literally just happened.


## Speaker_0

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:33]** This feels like the talk show that happens after the season where all the cast reunites and they talk about all the drama that happens.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** That's what it feels like.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** That's what it feels like just happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** I feel like it's a little premature.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:38]** Unlike your clapping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** It's not that big of a drama.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** You want to know what was big drama?

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:46]** Grenades and holographic clone ability last episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Yeah, that was bad.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** Let's move on.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** Oh, God, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** That was a lot of crap.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:52]** That was tough.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** Grenades are stupid.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:56]** It was tough, but I'm glad that we had that

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:57]** moment.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:57]** It's good.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** It's good to get upset.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:00]** It's good to dive into the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:04]** I feel my blood slowly boiling right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** Okay, well then we don't need to talk about that.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** We don't need to rehash the issue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:10]** Like a grenade went off inside my heart.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** Rick, where'd you get a hand grenade?

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** But I tried to throw it 20 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:18]** Anyways.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** It was a tough combat last time.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:21]** It was a tough combat.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:24]** It was a lot...

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:27]** A lot of that happened, and if you think about it, your characters are kind of worn thin.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:35]** They've been going through a lot, as was pointed out by Mr. Will at one point.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** Not Will Save, no relation.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:40]** Yes.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:43]** You have really only had one night's rest.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:49]** You got on after some combat in the docking bay, the hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:51]** This is super intense, honestly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** Yeah.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** And in the second day, you had a power outage.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** You went, Nico was shot.

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** You put somebody in a cargo bay.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:05]** You went through and... We locked somebody in a cargo crate.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** In a cargo crate.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:15]** You dealt with... Which is not that strange because he was a hostile person and we had nowhere to restrain him.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** You're right.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:16]** I still hold by that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:18]** Okay.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:18]** I agree.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** I agree with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** How are your characters feeling?

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:24]** Let's do a quick temperature check.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:34]** Now that this combat has come to a pause, a beat, and you all have had several combats in a row.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** How are your characters feeling?

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** Remember, you were in the gym.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:45]** I'll do a little recap in a second, but I just want to see off the start how y'all are feeling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:47]** Rick's doing okay.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:50]** His health and resolve points are actually pretty good.

**[00:04:52 - 00:05:00]** And he's finally feeling like they've made progress in this mystery of just chaotic who's who's and what's and what's.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:08]** So we're finally getting somewhere with the information we were handed that the GM didn't give us all of our information.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:13]** That's a little blame on John.


## Speaker_0

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:13]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:16]** I'm quite sure I gave you all the information that you needed and found out at the time.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:25]** I'm going back and listening to these first episodes and I'm like, wait, that person was a bad person and why didn't they – why didn't we know more then or why didn't we –

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** get more information.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** Well, I don't know.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** Give me your theory.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:34]** The interactions with Trostnik were very strange.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** I still don't understand those ones.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:46]** The whole Pearside stuff was... I still can't put heads or tails to what happened there.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:53]** But the way Algiata, we now know, has been a astrozoan the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:59]** I'm still super confused on it.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:02]** But I feel like we're finally getting... We got two of the three Astrozoans.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** Will's shaking his head.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:07]** Nick killed one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:11]** I think Dr. Okay is...

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:17]** Just left with more questions as to why all these events are happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** You're looking for the through line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** Yeah.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:32]** I'm trying to piece together how this has to deal with what happened on the platform.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:58]** and what um when they left and like what it has to do with uh his colleague uh Dr Bruce doccus yeah that's a big question are we being targeted yeah are our four characters were we put onto the same ship for a reason and that's why this is being targeted or is this commonplace among the stars in Starfinder that Pirates just constantly steal ships and they're you know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:24]** that kind of nonsense let's ask the pirate kelly your thoughts yeah kelly or here's how often do you guys just steal is this common cruise ships it's a fairly often affair yeah to be fair um uh here's is worried that they're after the relic for sure so he feels like time is of the essence um and he's also extremely confused because god wina um

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:50]** claimed at least before that um he killed like her whole family so it's commonplace we do it all the time but i don't know why that person i mean here's killed a lot of people but he doesn't remember that so obviously that idea i guess was planted into her head so he wants to get to the bottom of that yeah so here's is definitely on that target list for at least the pirates that came on board yeah it appears so what's nico's stance how's he doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:54]** Wait, who are we waiting to hear from?

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:55]** Sorry.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** Oh, I am so sorry.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** Nick.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Kevin said, Nico, what's your theory?

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** That just came through.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:04]** That just came through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** There is a lag.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** Your apology is necessary.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:13]** I often take my time to form a sentence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** Is that Nico or Dr. OK?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** I can't tell.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** My theory?

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** Well, OK.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** Status report on Nico.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** Nico's feeling a little worn thin.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:27]** Health at 4 of 12.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** No, 4 of 16.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** Stamina at 4 of 12.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** Resolve 1 of 3.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** He's definitely feeling tired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:43]** Yeah, I think you were shot last episode or the episode before that, I think.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:45]** You were hit by the cavitation pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:56]** And on top of that, Nico's feeling a little wiry and edging a little bit on Paranoid.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** So he's starting to feel that.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:03]** He's starting to feel a little take no chances type of vibe here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Take no chances.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** Interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** A little cornered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** A little cornered.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:19]** And I mean, the first thing you did when you came on board was check to see if there were any warrants, for lack of a better term, out for you.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:21]** Any bounties on your head, right?

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:27]** So this has been in the back of your mind being slowly eroded away by all the suspicion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:33]** I mean, his initial theory was, this is just a pirate attack, but...

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:43]** After hearing that some of the pirates have a little bit of prior knowledge of the people inside, he's kind of feeling... He doesn't know that anymore.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:49]** What that pirate said he hears is also kind of shaking him a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:50]** How so?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:53]** The pirate had foreknowledge of hears.

**[00:09:53 - 00:10:04]** I mean, maybe that's because they were in concentric circles, but maybe that's also due to the fact that the pirates knew who was aboard.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:09]** They knew who was on the ship, and they targeted it for that reason.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:16]** So he's kind of feeling a little cornered, a little paranoid, and a little bit more dangerous as a result.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:19]** Take no chance to survive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** Kev, you look like you're going to say something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** No, I got nothing.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:28]** I'm just going to say something must be remotely controlling some of these people.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:33]** I think with Lozu just staring at a wall a few episodes ago, and then...

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** and then Godwina doing what she did.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** So, yeah.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:41]** There might be some puppet master somewhere, perhaps, which is kind of creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:44]** Did we check Godwina's ID?

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** Is she actually Godwina?

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:53]** I think so, but I think that... We're taking their word that there's only three of those Astrozoans, and what if they're all Astrozoans?

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:55]** They're called the Starfishers, for Christ's sake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:58]** Because they fish among the stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:01]** All this is a little fishy to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:03]** Sorry, Will, what?

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** Wait, is that a punishment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** It's not unlike them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** I vote for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** Is that a pun, though?

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** Yeah, because it's a starfisher.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:13]** It's a little fishy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** I don't think it's a punishment.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** Sorry, Nick, I don't think you got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Sorry, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:22]** I don't know if it was punny enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:26]** Dr. K, what were you saying when we rudely interrupted you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:29]** Nothing really of consequence.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:32]** Nothing really of consequence.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** It's usually never true.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:33]** Agreement.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** General agreement.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:36]** Fishiness.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Fishiness.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** Fishmongers.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:40]** Yeah.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:41]** Who knows?

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** Well, I think with that.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:47]** I think we should keep this ball rolling, this train going.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:50]** Maybe more answers will come along the way.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:52]** Maybe just more questions.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:52]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** This dice rolling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:56]** Some dice rolling.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** Actually, I just came up with this.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:58]** I think it'd be cool.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** What dice are you rolling today?

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** It's kind of like your dice of the day.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** What's your dice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:11]** My dice are always the Starfinder dice from... Why'd you ask that question?


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:11]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:14]** How dare you, John?

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:16]** Why did you ask that question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:20]** Are you blaming me for your failure to remember the name of the dice manufacturer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** Yeah, because I have a terrible memory.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** Is it Q Factory?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** Yeah, it's Q something.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:49]** It wouldn't be the butterskull ranch dice that you've been keeping from Kelly, would it be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** No, no, no.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:53]** Kelly's character in D&D has been waiting for a long time to go to.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:55]** Very long time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** They're actually in the front of the store.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:01]** Yeah, yeah.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** Painful.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** Painful memories.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:05]** Yeah.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** What is this ranch you speak of?

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Nick Kelly.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:19]** I am rolling digital dice today, but I did find a d20 that I got from a Magic the Gathering

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:46]** It's the same set of dice that Kev has given me.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** The Starfinder dice.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:49]** The official Starfinder dice.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** From Q Workshop.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:51]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:56]** Which AP was it that you had, Nick?

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:56]** Do you remember, Kev?

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** No, I don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** What color are they, Nick?

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:03]** They are navy blue or midnight blue or galaxy blue or some form shade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:05]** I think that's the Signal of Screams AP.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:08]** I think that's the Signal of Screams official.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** I still have the ones for Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:11]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** Those are something of flames or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:19]** Will, do you have the three-fold conspiracy die?

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:21]** I believe I do.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** Because that's what I'm rolling.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** Yeah.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** It's the gray ones, right?

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Yeah, the gray and yellow ones.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:26]** They're nice.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:30]** I'm also rolling some BLM die from Heartbeat Dice.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** They're cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:35]** Heartbeat for your hearts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Can you show us?

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:37]** Yeah.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** One of them...

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:41]** The crit says BLM, and the other one is a raised fist.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** They're black and yellow.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:44]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:48]** What was that giant gold one that I saw?

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** This one.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:50]** That's the Kraken die.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** Oh, my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** Dude, it weighs a pound.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** They're great.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:55]** They're only like $25 or $30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** How do you?

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:59]** I mean, we can't even roll that in person, man.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** I think it would just break the table.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:03]** Well, that's why I rolled on the dice tray.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** Let's see if I can capture it with the mic.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:04]** Hold on.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:06]** I'm going to move the mic towards it.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:09]** Yeah, it sounds a lot.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:09]** Let's see.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** I'm just going to turn off the music.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** What are we rolling for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** Did you hear that?

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** Yeah.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** Oh, my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** The die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** Wow.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** Pretty intense.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:22]** Yeah.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:23]** Okay.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** Don't roll that.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:26]** Don't roll that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** I'm trying to be sneaky with my rolls, and I rolled that one.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:30]** Yeah.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** I'll get a new foundation.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:35]** A new foundation for your garage.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:43]** So let's dive in and do a quick recap for us and for all the listeners.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:56]** So if you go back in your minds a couple episodes, a couple weeks, think about how after discovering the body of the real Captain Rameem and what a...

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:09]** crazy moment that was and discovering the true shape-shifting nature of the Vesk bounty hunter Drostenek in a secret storage hold.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:25]** You unveiled the insidious plot of a group of pirates known as the Starfishers, bent on raiding the Chimera, as they do with many other ships, along its route to Absalom Station.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:26]** Route.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:29]** Along its route to Absalom Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:31]** Is it route or root?

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** Route or root.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:34]** Well, it's not root or whatever you were saying.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** It's a very odd pronunciation.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** Yeah, I was like, root.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:40]** Perhaps...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:44]** I'll probably just clip it out and then every time I try and say it, we'll only say that.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:47]** The route to Absalom Station.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:50]** To Absalom Station.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:50]** Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:55]** No sooner than this had become known.

**[00:17:55 - 00:18:04]** this route to Absalom Station, that there was a small breach explosion above you signaling likely the beginning of the raid.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:17]** You travel along the spine of the ship in a secret access tube and emerged to find yourself in the starboard cargo bay where the raid had already reached the crew.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:20]** Song, the cook, was dead.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:33]** You encountered and captured two pirates, Sabrina and Godwina, the latter of whom cannot remember the details of their vitriol for years.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:43]** Now, in an effort to secure the ship, you check in on some noise and something in the gym, only to find two first mate Lozu Pahirs.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:52]** However, it becomes swiftly clear that one of them is a part of the raid, and a difficult fight ensues.

**[00:18:52 - 00:19:06]** And despite helpful boosts by Dr. OK and some trick attacks from Nico and some strong attacks from Hears and Rick, the imposter's holographic abilities wear down your patience and your nerves.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:10]** Finally, they seem to relent.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:14]** And as we go in, I'm going to bring us over to roll 20.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:20]** I'll remind you that they seemed to relent, raise their hands.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:35]** drop their pistol, go to one knee, and confess, responding to Rick's previous question, who are you?

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:39]** And they say, I am called Wham.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** Wham.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:45]** And now we're here in the gym, and this not-Losu is on one knee.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:53]** Rick, standing to the right, hears immediately in front the presumably real Losu, unconscious on the mat behind you.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** Nico, Dr.

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:00]** O.K., in the room, and the two pirates bound on the floor.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** What do you all do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** I am called W.E.M.,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:09]** Yeah.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:14]** Rick keeps his gun trained on Wim.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:16]** Uh-huh.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** And he's going to tell here.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:20]** Well, no, because the problem is his natural zone.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** Is it still looking like Lozu?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** Still looks like Lozu.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:32]** And if you'll recall, there's one Lozu, the one unconscious, who's wearing the same outfit that you remember she's been in the whole time.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** This Lozu is just wearing casual station wear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:42]** So Rick is going to look at Notlozu and say, return to your actual form.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:45]** Who's to say that I have an actual form?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:49]** Return to your actual form.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:53]** And he rolls an intimidation as he kind of clinches his gun.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:53]** Okay.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:55]** Natural 20 on that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** Natural 20.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:58]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** With a plus three to intimidate.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** So 23 for intimidation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** 23 for intimidation.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** Give me all of you a sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** On Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** No, on not.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:07]** Should I roll a bluff?

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** No, on not the Lozu.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:10]** Three.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:11]** Three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** Really perceptive.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** Yeah.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** With my plus one.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:15]** Yeah.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:17]** That's pretty sad.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:18]** Yeah.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:18]** I got a four.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:19]** Four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** My minus one.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:20]** Okay.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:24]** That's going to be an 11 for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** Shit.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** 11.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:27]** 26.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** 26.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:30]** All right.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** As soon as Rick prods,

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** This not Lozu.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:43]** You see something in their face change, just like a ripple go over their skin.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:47]** And you see their face clench.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:56]** And in an instant, you see one of their hands reach down and grab a switchblade that is at their face.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** hip.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:00]** And they go to strike at Rick.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:07]** And with that watch out, there's no surprise round, but you will need to roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:07]** Seriously?

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** Yes.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:10]** If you put the damn clones out again, I'm quitting.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:12]** I'm just done walking away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:19]** We are rolling for initiative.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** Nico, 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** Rick rolled a 6, so that's a 10.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** 10 for Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** Sorry.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:33]** 19 on the die for 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** 24, Dr. Okay.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Nico, what'd you get?

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:36]** 14.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** 14.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:39]** Okay.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:40]** Man.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:43]** I am excited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** Oh, and correction.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** I didn't have my laser out.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** I actually have my greataxe out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:48]** Okay.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:52]** Well, it's still pretty as threatening, I have to say.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:53]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:53]** Yeah.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:55]** Absolutely still threatening.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:56]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** If not more threatening.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** If not more threatening.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:03]** And it does more damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** All right.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Cool.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Excellent.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Excellent stuff.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:10]** So with that, watch out, Dr. OK.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** Well done.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:17]** I'm going to say that, Rick, you were able to notice this and have enough time to react.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:20]** So there's not going to be a surprise round.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:42]** because i think that watch out was was a solid one i didn't even prompt you you just went right for it you didn't pause you didn't hesitate first thing you said that was a good character role play moment and i want to give it to you i want to acknowledge that so with that said we are going to go into combat though it is the top of round one part two is what we're going to call it

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:42]** Dr.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:50]** O.K., you see Sabrina, her eyes, the human pirate that's sitting crisscross applesauce back near the door.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:58]** Her eyes, whereas she was looking at the ground, her eyes now perk up and look, and she's paying very close attention to what is going on.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** But she does not seem surprised.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:06]** It is not Lozu's turn, or rather, Wem's.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** that we shall call them.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:11]** And Wim is going to slash at Rick.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:13]** Can they hit Rick?

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** Let's find out.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:17]** What's your KAC?

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** 15.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** Okay, 23 hits.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:19]** Damn.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:38]** So that is going to be five points of damage as the switchblade slams into your leg, and they stand up, pivoting on their heel, taking you, not by surprise, but still hitting you, and that makes me very happy.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:42]** With that, they are going to take a...

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:52]** guarded step back and to out of the way of Rick and of here's to avoid an attack of opportunity.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:54]** And it is going to be Dr.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:54]** O.K.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** 's turn.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:56]** What are you doing, Dr.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:56]** O.K.?

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:02]** You know this creature is probably low on health, desperate, and fighting for its life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:11]** So they would have partial... So I would have to... Okay.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:14]** They probably have partial cover from Keir's... Soft cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** Soft cover.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:15]** Thank you.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:16]** Thank you, rules lawyer.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** So what do you want to do, Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** O.K.?

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:21]** Did I notice anything at any point?


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:21]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** No, I don't think so.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:32]** You had done a mysticism check last episode, I think it was, or maybe two episodes ago, to see what you knew, and that's when you realized that they were likely an astrozone, I believe.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** I believe that.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** So, but you didn't notice anything.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:37]** Was it mysticism or life science?

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:41]** It was a life science, although I thought I had heard the word mysticism, but maybe we were just talking about rules.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** As we do.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:54]** Yeah, so I'm going to move and then shoot Notlozu with a pharmacological inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** Oh, no way.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** What's it going to do?

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:58]** What is the inhibitor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:10]** The pharmacological inhibitor induces a mild estrogen to a living creature's body, making it difficult for the target to move or act.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:19]** Target gains the encumbered condition, but also succeed at a fortitude save or also gain the entangled condition.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:19]** Wow.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:20]** I like it.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** All right.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Roll to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:24]** This could be a game changer.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** 14.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:27]** 14 against...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:32]** Just missed.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:36]** It hits and then seems to go into their leg and then fall out and doesn't inject.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** You just missed.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:40]** It was KAC 15 to get it.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** I'll tell you.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:42]** This close.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** This close.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** Your silence tells me everything.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** Speaks volumes.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:50]** I'm very sad right now.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** I'm very sad right now.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:57]** Nico, unless you wanted to do anything else with your turn, Doctor, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:03]** I mean, is it of any use to do a life science identified creature?

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** Like, I'm pretty confident.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:07]** I have that information.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:07]** Yeah.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:16]** I think you already have everything that you need to know, but I'm happy to see if there's anything else to give you if you really want to make that roll.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** There's not much else to find out, I'll be honest.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:19]** Maybe their class.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:23]** Maybe a couple abilities that they have, which is not many.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** They don't have any class.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:25]** Wow.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** Rude.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:28]** Punishment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:31]** Come on.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** Come on.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Come on, I'm with it.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** I vote yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** Sure.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:37]** I vote no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Oh, come on, everyone else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** John votes no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** John, you're a spoiled sport.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** I'm a what?

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:47]** So, wait, Will's vote is abstaining, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:49]** I think Will's mad at me because it didn't hit.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** Well, that's a thumbs up.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:53]** Yeah, he's just mad because it didn't hit, so that's fine.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** I thought it had to be four out of five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** It's okay.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** I move to strike John from all punishment votes.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:03]** Vote no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** I'm gonna vote no for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** You can't just vote me out.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** It's in your best interest to always vote nay, John.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:13]** That's not necessarily true.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** I thought that was good, but I didn't think it was punishment worthy.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** That's all I'm going to say.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:17]** You're picky.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** I am picky.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:19]** I need to be.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:22]** Did I get the punishment or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:26]** He needs a real coroner is what he needs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** Yeah.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Somebody could use that.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** That could change somebody's life.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:34]** Literally, that could save somebody's life.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** Nico, what are you doing with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:39]** Nico's going to do a trick attack here.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Okay.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** So he's going to do a bluff check.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:43]** Okay.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:43]** Yeah.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:49]** He's going to do a bluff check to see if he succeeds, and he's going to try to do a non-lethal shooting attack here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:54]** Non-lethal on a trick attack.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:58]** Yeah, so the bluff, I need to roll and meet a DC, right, to see whether I succeed against the bluff.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:02]** Or no, you make the bluff check 20 plus your target CR.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** Sorry, that's right.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:04]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** And you take a minus four penalty for making it non-lethal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** On the attack roll.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** On the attack, not on the bluff.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:12]** Correct.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** What'd you get on your bluff?

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Oof.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:19]** 17 on the die.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:19]** Nice.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** Plus 8.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:22]** That's 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** Yeah, that meets it.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** All righty.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** So that was successful.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:30]** Now give me your attack minus 4.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:33]** He's only going to shoot with 1, by the way.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:33]** All right.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Give me that roll, minus 4.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:40]** Actually, only minus 1 at the end of the day because I got a plus 3.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** Right, but the minus 4 is in there.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** That's the whole point.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:44]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:47]** What's the EAC, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:49]** I'm not going to tell you the EAC.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:51]** That's not how this works, Nick.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** You need to tell me the roll.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** I see.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:54]** Oh, man.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** By the way.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** Good try, Nick.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** He's trying to trick you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Remember, it's a 16 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** I'm picky, Nick.

**[00:29:59 - 00:29:59]** Remember?

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:02]** 16 against EAC.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:02]** That's a hit.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:03]** Yep.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:04]** Well done.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:10]** So the target will be flat-footed, and you will add an additional D4 of damage to that roll.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** This could be it.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** This could be the moment.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:17]** This is three on the damage die.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:17]** Yeah.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:17]** And two.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:19]** That's five damage total.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Five damage total.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:25]** You see the shot hit their arm, and they do not go down.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** They're still up, but they're close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** Nico, well done.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** You take the shot, but they're not down.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:35]** They seem very close as if the next shot could take them down.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:40]** The next person is technically Godwina, but I gripped it from wrong there.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** Unconscious from Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:44]** I was going to ask for an update on her status.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** Yeah, she's still unconscious.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:50]** You shot with a – or no, Nico, I think, shot with a non-lethal against Godwina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** No, it was – I think it was me.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** It was you?

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:55]** No, that was – I blasted her in the back as she was running away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:55]** Yeah.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** Horrible.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** You don't shoot people in the back.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:57]** What are you doing?

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** You just let them run.

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:58]** They're running away?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:00]** Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:07]** Lozu, also unconscious from having a critical failure and knocking herself back in the head with a recoil and falling unconscious.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** Rick, your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:12]** Rick is pissed.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** He's already asked her to stand down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:17]** He's already been pissed about the clones?

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:17]** Everything.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:18]** Absolutely everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:23]** And now he's got his mechanical blood leaking out of his leg.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:32]** And so before he moves up to strike, he's going to roll a perception check on Sabrina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:37]** I got a six plus... What is my perception?

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** Perception...

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:41]** It's a five, so it's an 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:45]** She seems like she's just chilling, bound, crisscross applesauce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:48]** Well, I'm glad I wasted that roll on her perception.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:48]** Yes.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:53]** So then Rick is going to shout, keep an eye on Sabrina.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:58]** And then he's going to turn to Dr. Okay and say, check Lozu, make sure she's okay.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:06]** And then he's just going to baseball bat this giant great axe and swing at not Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** From 10 feet away?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** No, I'm going to move up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** Okay.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:15]** I kind of picture you taking one of those skipping strides where you're like, swing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** How about the forward somersault?

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:21]** Yeah.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:21]** That quick shot.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** Quick fire, Scott.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:25]** I burned my punishment.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** That's a plus one.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:30]** I have a plus four to hit, but I rolled two.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:31]** So that doesn't hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** Something about the skip.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:36]** Maybe there's a little lip there from the mat up to the rest of it.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:39]** And you just tripped a little bit, stumbled.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:39]** It's fine.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:40]** Swing and a miss.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:43]** That's why they call you misstep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:45]** It's all good.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:45]** Oh!

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** Ouch!

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:47]** Quickfire.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** I think that one's going to stick.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:50]** I think that one's going to stick, Kev.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:56]** Quickfire and Misstep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:00]** Tune in next time for the adventures of Quickfire and Misstep.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** Is Misstep and Murderbot?

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** Misstep and, yeah.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:05]** It's Mis-M-S dot Misstep.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:08]** I like it.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** I like it.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** That's putty enough, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:38]** man out of nowhere we're just it was good we are just all going for puns i'm still gonna go i'm still gonna vote no on that miss i'm sorry puns are fun here's what are you doing um here's walks up to not lozu and is going can you end this yeah that's what here's wants to do for sure so he's gonna roll um with his dueling sword okay and he's gonna do a non-lethal attack


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:40]** Man, you guys are really about the non-lethal here.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:43]** You guys are... We want to solve this mystery.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:47]** You went from throwing people in crates to just not killing people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:49]** Throwing somebody in a crate is a non-lethal move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:54]** I didn't really specify, but... We could have just thrown him out the airlock.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:58]** I don't know what NotLowZoo's HP is at.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** I don't care.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** I was hit, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** All right, Dr. Okay.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** I was trying to.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:05]** Dr. Lethal, it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:16]** No, I was just simply injecting with a painful, painful injection to dissuade her from further antagonizing us.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Come on, Heerzy.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** Hit her hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** Heerzy.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:22]** All right, so that's an 18 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** Yeah, that's a hit.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** Ooh, yeah.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:28]** Doesn't matter what you're trying to do, that's a hit.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:32]** And how much damage did you do with your hit, Heerzy?

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:32]** Four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:50]** for non lethal damage what do you do um here's is going to try to avoid the chest of not lozu and just kind of come in and stab the side like to avoid the organs got it yeah like on the side of her body yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:51 - 00:35:03]** And as that happens, you hear, and she puts, or they put their hands on the bench that is in front of them and collapse onto their knees as they fall unconscious.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:06]** But stable because you took them down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:13]** Seriously, though, that guy was seriously really dumb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:15]** Who's keeping an eye on Sabrina?

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** Are we out of combat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** You are out of combat.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:24]** A dumb move to try and surprise you and then take Rick down a little more.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:27]** With a knife the size of a pencil.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** Well, the tactical switchblade did hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:31]** Rick actually helped.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:34]** He distracted her with the big swing and miss.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** That's why you were able to hit.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:36]** That's the only reason.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:38]** Whatever you gotta do to justify it.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** Whatever you gotta do to justify it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:43]** That's right.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:43]** All right.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:43]** Yeah.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:46]** Okay, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:54]** As soon as that happened, you hear a small click off to the south of the wall here near the mat.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:58]** And maybe something about the way that they fell seemed to trigger something.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:01]** And there's a small door that you never noticed swings open.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:08]** And you can see inside are two more of the Mark I healing serums.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:11]** that have the diorama words written on it.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:11]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** You are right near them.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:18]** You can see two Mark one here, healing serums in this little alcove in the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:28]** I take them and I must find the origin of how they came on this ship.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:31]** Is Lozu... She's unconscious.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** So can I do first aid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:40]** Yeah, you can either use your kit to give her first aid or you can give her one of the healing serums.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** I'll just give her a healing serum.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:43]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:47 - 00:37:14]** she sits up looks around you can tell that out of everything that's happened she is just as frazzled as you are because she has been trying to deal with the same threats and the same confusion that the four of you have for the same amount of time and she looks at dr okay and says is what's what what what happened is is everything okay she kind of sits up sits on her elbows


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:22]** We have an imposter that... Do you remember what happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** What's the last thing you remember?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:31]** Well, the last thing I remember was trying to shoot at this imposter.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:36]** And then I think I misfired and the gun hit me.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:41]** But before that, I woke up and...

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:46]** Wow, she kind of brushes some hair, tries to focus her eyes.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:54]** I heard that explosion and I rushed to the bridge to try and get a damage report from the captain.

**[00:37:54 - 00:38:01]** But these two pirates had gotten there before me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:13]** It looked like they had Captain Rameem at gunpoint, but then he transformed into a creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** They are shapeshifters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** Yeah.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** Astrozoans.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** Yeah, like that one.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:27]** And all of you look down and Wham has started to move back into that weird amorphous pink shape that you saw Trostenec go into.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:31]** I was so surprised.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:33]** I nearly dropped dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:44]** Ramin greeted the pirates and had them follow along to find the professor's relic in the port cargo hold.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:46]** I ducked out of sight.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:50]** I started looking for others that I could trust.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:50 - 00:39:06]** As she says all that, Rick shoots a look at Sabrina and marches over towards her and grabs her by the arm and kind of throws her towards Lozu and says, you did not say anything about the relic.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:07]** Tell us more.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:10]** And pushes her kind of on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** To Sabrina?

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:15]** I want to move Sabrina towards Lozu.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** Okay.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:19]** So whatever role I have to do to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:19]** That's fine.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:22]** You're able to pick her up and she goes willingly.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:24]** She kind of catches herself.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:26]** She doesn't let herself fall if you're trying to push her.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:33]** And as soon as she comes into view, Lozu's eyes widen and she sees Sabrina.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** Yes.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:36]** I almost got caught by one.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** She was one of three people.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:44]** And I hid in here, but then there must have been something that happened.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:48]** And then that one found me.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:51]** And she points over at Wem, not Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:58]** I can't believe Rameem was always so friendly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:02]** Lozu, I'm sorry to tell you, but Rameem is dead.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:06]** These shapeshifters have taken over the body's...

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** The appearance of the bodies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:14]** She puts her heads in her hands and you can see a few tears and she wipes them away.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Now's not the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** Can I roll a sense motive on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:18]** Yeah.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** On Lozu?

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** I got a 5.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:22]** I'll roll 2.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** 5, okay.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** Those weren't... Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** Dr. Er... Niko?

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:28]** 19.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** Yeah, they seem like real tears.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:48]** She seems like she's... She is flabbergasted, though not... She is actually surprised, actually flabbergasted, that who she thought she had trusted and had just fought off some sort of takeover from Jim Taroka and the Goblins...

**[00:40:50 - 00:41:04]** she that same person turned out to not be that person and you're saying that the that the captain is dead and whoever that was is not them that seems genuine sabrina looks up at you rick and says


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:10]** I had no idea about this relic.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:15]** I was not, nor have I been on board the ship.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** I think that's her voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:21]** I have not been aboard the ship.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** I thought she was Irish.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** She had an Irish accent.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:26]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** No.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** Come on.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:27]** Continuity.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:29]** Continuity.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:29]** Get it together.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** She was not Irish.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** She was definitely not Irish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:41]** If anything, she was a little British, but she had this very explicit tone where everything is a little crispy when she talks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:54]** I'm gonna roll sense motive on that on her statement okay it is rolling though she seems genuine okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** What is everyone thinking?

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:56]** What are you doing?

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** Lozu is trying to recover.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:02]** Godwina and Wham are unconscious.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:05]** Sabrina is sitting up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:13]** I think... I would like to search this panel where this gear appeared.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:15]** Okay.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:19]** Here's us going to look at the package that he picked up from Trostnik's body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:20]** Okay.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** So we got package.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** We got looking at the alcove.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** Rick, you were saying something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:32]** Yeah, Rick is going to just kind of speak out loud and say, we need to secure these prisoners.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** How do we secure the astrozoan properly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:42]** You could guess, well, with the shapeshifting, I'll say this.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** Let me double check the alien archive too.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** I don't know that they...

**[00:42:49 - 00:43:15]** necessarily can like shape just out of anything but i'm checking meanwhile continue to squeeze through a vent we know that they can't squeeze sabrina's conscious correct she is conscious yeah okay um what would you like quick fire nico nico's coming over to sabrina and he's gonna be like do you know who i am and he's gonna be very aggressive in his questioning he's he's done now he's fed up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:19]** We could trap them in an airlock conceivably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** Hold on.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:24]** Doctor, okay, I might need you in a second if you can whip up a truth serum here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:27]** Do you know who I can- I don't have anything like that.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:31]** That sounds like hocus pocus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:32]** I'm sure there's a way.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:33]** I just don't know if you're.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** I'll say that they can squeeze.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:45]** So, yeah, they can move through an area as small as one quarter their space without squeezing or one eighth their space without squeezing.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:49]** So you need to get a very tight constriction in order to.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** Which would be an airlock.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:51]** Could do that.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:54]** There is an airlock through... Well, we don't have time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:57]** Like, we need to get to the cargo bay or the bridge, like, now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:01]** We need to get to the bridge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** Give me a wisdom check, Rick.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** Wisdom check?

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** My wisdom's low.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:05]** That's not fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:10]** Well, you were the one who just said that, so... Which means I'm on to something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:11]** I got 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:28]** I was just going to say, from Lozu's story just now and from everything that was said in the time that's passed, you would guess that if you wanted to apprehend them with the relic, they're more likely to be in the cargo bay than they are at the bridge still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:36]** And Rick, knowing that these two want that relic, he's going to say they're after the relic and it is in the port's cargo bay.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:39]** Nico's hoping to trigger...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:43]** Nico, you walk over to Sabrina.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:45]** I want to make sure that we go over this.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:48]** You walk over to Sabrina and shout, do you know who I am?

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:51]** And she looks at you and says, I did not know you before you were quick fire.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:54]** So no, I don't know who you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:57]** I got a 13.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Sorry, 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:00]** Sense motive.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** That is a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** She doesn't know who you are before then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:08]** How did God we know here's?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:12]** You'd have to ask her, but then again, she doesn't remember.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:15]** Is that how Sabrina says it?

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:17]** No, I'm telling you as the GM.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:22]** But if you want to ask, you're asking Sabrina, how does Gawina know here?

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:22]** Sorry.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:23]** That's how I took that.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** Yeah.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** Okay.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:25]** Role play, John.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:26]** Geez.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:26]** Wow.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:32]** Well, Nick didn't really say it in his... Nick went from up here with like, do you know who I am?

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:35]** To like, how does he know who Gawina was actually instead?

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** So I was like, are you asking... I'll give you that.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** That's fair.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** Nico, you asked that.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** Sabrina says...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** I do not know.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** She's never mentioned it before today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:49]** Aside from the relic, what are you guys after here?

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:50]** Speak now.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** I have no patience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** I was just speaking.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:58]** We are after everything that's on the ship.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:01]** I did not know about the relic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:06]** Nope, I don't assist.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:09]** Rick goes to push her and kind of slips and misses her shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** She doesn't even notice.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:13]** I don't know what else there is.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:15]** I board these ships.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** I take what I want.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:19]** I leave the ships.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:22]** And that is the entire story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** All right.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:28]** So how do you select your ships?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:33]** I am not usually the one to select the ships.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** I'm told with ships.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:36]** Why a ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** I don't know.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:40]** She raises her locked hands.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** Why work for these starfish heads?

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** Come on, speak quickly.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:49]** I don't have time for this crap.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** She takes what she wants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** I take what I want.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:56]** I live a life in which I can do what I want.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:58]** And if I want to hurt people, I hurt them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** And if I don't, I don't.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** I just take what I want and I move on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** We need to move now.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** We need to get to that port cargo bay.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** What should we do with them?

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:11]** We can't take them with us.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Do we just kill them?

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:14]** That's a bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:19]** Do we just slaughter this one and leave her behind?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:21]** Do you want to assist with that, Dr. Okay?

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** So, real quick, let's just make sure we're good.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** Rick, you're bluffing.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** Dr. Okay, you're assisting.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** Nico, what were you going to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:30]** Nico was just going to say...

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** I'm good with killing them.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:34]** And he's just going to knock her unconscious and just have her.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** That's just going to be it for her.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** She's going to knock him out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** She can't answer any questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:39]** Okay, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** I will say that you are able to do that.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** No point in bluffing.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** Yeah, there's no role.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:46]** What was your bluff role, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** I rolled a nine.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:49]** Yeah, nine.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** Nine?

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:50]** Okay.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:54]** That is the last thing that Sabrina heard as Nico is knocked out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:59]** So now we have two unconscious, three unconscious pirates.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** What do we do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** Let's store them in the same space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** We need to get to that cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:05]** Let's store them in that same space that we found those health packs.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** Let's get to the bridge.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:06]** I'm sick of this crap.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:08]** Let's go finish this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:11]** How big is that health pack storage?

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:11]** Can we do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** That's what I was asking.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** What is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:18]** Yeah, let's shut the Astrozoan in the... That's like a little shelf.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Yeah, but they squish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:48]** sure if you want you can you pick them up you put them in there and you shut the door and you maybe you put something some weights up against it and it doesn't move well let's see that um i'm gonna can i i mean i don't know i suppose i could hit him with a pharmacological inhibitor too sure you want to do that why some lozu why can't we just come with us or stay here and guard the prisoners


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:50]** His body suits our story also.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** He's a murderous fucking pirate.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:57]** I'm fine with just... Like, we don't... I don't want real world security.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:01]** So you all are... If anybody's feeling squeamish about the wet work, I'll handle it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:01]** Lozu, what are your thoughts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:05]** I want to check on the other passengers.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** I want to secure the bridge.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:14]** And I think you all should go find out what's up with the relic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** I don't think so, Lozu.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:19]** Last time we left you to handle the bridge, we found you here.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:22]** At this point, no one's safe going around by themselves.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:23]** You leased the ball.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:24]** You're coming with us.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:27]** Everybody now is coming with us.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:29]** There's either Team Us or there's Team Dead.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:33]** Roll whatever you think is that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** phrase.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:38]** Whether that's intimidation, diplomacy.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:43]** That sounded like intimidation, so I think you're going to need to roll intimidation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** It sounded like diplomacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** That's Nick's diplomacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:52]** We know for a fact that this is the real Lozu now, and we have a really good thought that she's a good guy.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** We don't have to worry about her.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:59]** She's not a great combatant, and she's not very smart when it comes to her actions.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:01]** That doesn't mean she's a bad person.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:03]** We don't have to worry about her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** I'm not threatening her.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** I'm reminding her of the reality here.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** She just about died here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:08]** Oh, okay.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** I thought that sounded threatening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:13]** That did sound threatening.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:20]** I know the town might have sounded threatening, but he's really just trying to be very kind of harsh and very kind of just in her face.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** Like, this is the reality here.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** There's either team us or team dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:28]** The town was threatening, so I think you need to do roll a diplomacy check.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:28]** The town?

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** The town was threatening.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:31]** The town of Lozupa here.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** So, that's a 13.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:35]** I assisted.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** I succeeded.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** That's a 13 on the dice.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** I assisted with a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** That's a 13 on the dice.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:41]** 13 plus 4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:44]** That's a 7 to 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:47]** That's 17 plus 8 on my diplomacy check.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** So, that's a 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** Plus 8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** 25.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** Yeah.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** She looks down and says...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** You know what?

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:55]** You're right, Nico.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:06]** I don't ever think that there was not a team us, but I'm glad that you're fighting for the ship like I am.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** And she stands up.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** She grabs her pistol.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:14]** And she says, do you know what this relic is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:18]** No clue, but we're... If you have any idea, you should tell us now.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** Yeah, I'd like to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:24]** That was not a question as if I knew.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:27]** That was just a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:30]** Who has the most information?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:32]** You got a 12 on sense motive there?

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** Sorry, 11 on sense motive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:36]** She just asked you and said, do you know what this relic is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** Yeah.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** Yeah.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:39]** Um...

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:41]** We need to move.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** Let's go.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:47]** Rick kind of steps over and he kind of looks around and says like, what do we do with these prisoners?

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:49]** We can't just leave them on their own.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:49]** They'll escape.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** Well, they aren't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:53]** Let's use the idea to shove them in the space.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Let's do that.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** You guys go on ahead.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** The one's in there.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:57]** You guys go on ahead.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** I'll be right behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** You better roll a bluff on that one.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:04]** Rick can't just, like, openly walk away from you murdering people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** Yeah.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** Lowe's is going to say, I'm sorry, Nico.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:08]** They are bound.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:12]** I think the best thing to do is to lock these doors here and to leave them in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:13]** Don't kill the dwarf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** Let's just lock them in.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** Is there any way we can tie them up inside the airlock?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:20]** Let's go.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:24]** So, okay, we'll take a few minutes to bunch them all up in the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:30]** And then we'll lock the doors on this side, and I'm going to exit this side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** That's what Lozu does, too.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** She walks over with you and leaves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** Nico's going to make a suggestion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** And we can secure these doors, like, confidently?

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:36]** The same.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:50]** Yeah, she actually walks over and as she walks over, she looks at you, Rick, and she actually reaches up and holds up her wrist to the door and it shuts and she looks over at you and says, there's something that you all should have.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** I have it as well.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:56]** And she pulls out a key and she says, this will unlock any door on the ship.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:59]** I have a chip that allows me to do that.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:02]** Only I and the captain could have that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:02]** Rick nods.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:07]** He's going to turn around and walk back the other way to that one restricted door we couldn't get into earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:11]** So you leave through the locked door and go to that restricted door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** Sweet!

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:16]** Let's do it!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** Alright.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:20]** So this door is confidently locked.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:22]** Nobody can get in unless they have access.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:27]** As soon as... Is Lozu going to go... What's the plan?

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** We're going to the cargo bay?

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:30]** We're going straight to the relic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:36]** I think we should go to the port cargo bay and find out what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:36 - 00:54:00]** is and as you are about to leave she says i i'm concerned that there's something some something larger and she almost like she like freezes for a second she tries to say it her brain is like clearly trying to work but it's a little odd and and she says something has been


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:04]** happening aboard the ship and I don't know what it is.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:12]** The professor was acting strangely yesterday.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:19]** I checked on him and he was almost catatonic mumbling.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** I can't remember.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** I can't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:25]** Similar to what you were doing in the hall the last time we saw you?

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:27]** What was I doing in the hall?

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** You were glaring at the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:31]** John, I'm going to roll mysticism on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:33]** Okay.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** That's a 19.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** 19.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** Yeah.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:40]** You are not sure why these things are connected.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:41]** It could be magic.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** It could be magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:52]** Also seems like you sense like can you feel magic or is that like since magic is a that's like sorry I'm not playing a spellcaster so I don't know enough about him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:59]** Is it physical science or it would be like saying are there any reasons why magic could help out with this.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:03]** Sure magic could cause something like this to happen but it seems equally as likely that it's not.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** it seems really like anything.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:06]** The 19 doesn't shed any light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:12]** My question was like, there is a sense magic, um, like spell or feet or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** I think you can detect magic.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** Yeah.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:19]** But that's not what I think you were doing or like, that's a spell that exists.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:35]** yeah and then and then she looks back and just says i i tell you because well i don't know what will happen but i'm glad that we are facing this together and she nods and then starts to leave


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:39]** Can I do perception or wisdom?

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** No, is it wisdom?

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:45]** Can I sense at all that she's under somebody else's control?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:45]** Sure.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:50]** I can say that you can, but you don't sense that is what I'll say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:56]** I mean, I don't think she's under somebody's control now, but there's a feeling that somebody else can take control of her.

**[00:55:56 - 00:56:02]** And in combat, that'd be bad to have her next to us if she's going to turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:28]** got it um what would that be that might be mysticism that might also be maybe physical science it depends on how you want to view it through whatever lens you want to view it through like what do you think is the means by which they would control them and then make that role that's my suggestion rick rick doesn't have any he's just rolling his head about like jesus what's he doesn't trust anybody either okay it's all just gonna come back and bite us here's a nico what are you thinking

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:49]** uh here's think it could possibly be a technological control you could roll computers to like see if there's anything going on with that that's like a 26 yeah 26 okay that's a 20 for nico yeah 20 for nico so it sounds like you got around 30 maybe it sounds like you got a lot um okay nice

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:54]** So, do you think that computers could cause somebody to control?

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** Is that the question?

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:57]** Did I interpret that correctly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:06]** More along the lines of... If it's... Is there something in her... Integrated in her neurological system or something like that, but some tech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:07]** Got it.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:15]** You don't... Without, like, doing a full scan of her or, you know, like, cutting her open to see, there's no way for you to know.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:19]** I'm going to move you guys over to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:22]** the big map.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:30]** While we're all doing that, Rick puts away his axe, straps it to his back, pulls out his artillery laser, and reloads the battery on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:34]** Reloads the battery.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** Anybody else want to do any prep?

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:39]** Don't forget that you have some healing serums.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Does anybody need healing?

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** I need some healing, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:45]** Does healing cure stamina?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:48]** Ten minutes would cure stamina.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:54]** If you guys want, during that time of locking up and putting people away, the thing is that I think for that 10 minutes, you need to be doing nothing.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:56]** Like, you can't even be exerting yourself.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:59]** But if you wanted to take 10 minutes, you can take 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:01]** Yeah, Rick will state that.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:04]** Before we leave that room, he's going to say, like, I just need to rest for 10 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:08]** You all agreed on that and do some healing as well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** I'm okay, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:10]** Cool.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:11]** I don't know.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:14]** Is there a limitation on how many 10-minute rests we can do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:18]** I think you can only do, like, one per hour, I think it is.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** Let me look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** How much help do we do on a 10-minute rest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:30]** If you just, you can go to rest and recharge on your stamina, under stamina, and then hit 10-minute rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** But no spell recharges or anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:39]** If you guys wanted to, or I think you have some Mark I healing serums.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** You certainly have one.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:42]** There were two in that little app.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** You have two.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** You have two?

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:47]** Well, I have one from earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** I think you get what you're out of resolve points.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:53]** So when I hit rest and recharge, hold on.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:53]** I'm going to go back.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:57]** I'm going to increase this down to four, and I'm going to redo that.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:57]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** Can you be out of resolve points?

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** I think you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:03]** If you're out of resolve points, you'll die the moment you get hit, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:09]** The moment that you drop, that you lose all your health points, you will die if you don't have any resolve points.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:12]** So maybe, Nico, you get Mark went healing serum instead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:14]** Right?

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** Yeah.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:16]** Okay.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:21]** So it's 1d8 hit points if you want to use a healing serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:24]** I'll take that.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:24]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** Heal yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** That's a four.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** He's going to ask Dr. Okay.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:31]** Oh, I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:32]** Four.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:33]** That's good.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:37]** You got anything that could top my spells off?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:42]** Uh, not specifically unless the healing serum can do that.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:44]** I don't think it can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** Probably not then.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:45]** All right.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:46]** No worries.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:46]** Thanks.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:48]** I'm going to try to check that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** Yeah.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:57]** I can give you like a bonus on skills checks or something like in combat, but nothing right now.

**[00:59:59 - 00:59:59]** Yeah.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:02]** In the future, I will keep that in mind.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:03]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:04]** Yeah.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** This is a tough moment.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:08]** You guys are pulling everything together.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:11]** Lozu is not at full health by any means.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:16]** You all are really coming down to... I reload.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:23]** I don't equip, but I reload the semi-auto pistol that I picked up and other things top off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** What else are you guys thinking?

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:33]** I mean, this feels a little bit like you're finally going to go see what this relic is, finally see what it's all about and what everything's going on, and you're gearing up.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:36]** This is like the push, the sprint,

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:42]** You know, this is the, you've got to keep sprinting, but you guys are starting to really feel the effects of being low on health and spells.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:45]** I just, I don't trust anybody on this ship.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** Like, the professor could be the bad guy for all we know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:49]** Yep.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** Yeah, seriously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:53]** I don't even know.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]** Yeah, who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:57]** It could be anything.

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:01]** Nico's thinking, get control, get control, get control of the situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:03]** Nico almost lost it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:04]** Yeah.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:07]** I mean, here's is a little apprehensive because he's like chalk out of spells.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:11]** And, uh, but he's really excited for this relic for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:14]** The promise of treasure keeps you going.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:17]** Keeps you going.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:18]** You reload.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:24]** You seem to have a calm and cool collective standing in the hallway of the chimera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:29]** Just, uh, we need to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:32]** I'm ready to move forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** Let's move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:51]** So, standing in the dimly lit hallway of the chimera on the left side, you start to move forward, and I will reveal it for you, up to the port cargo bay.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:58]** Now, as you come up, you see a hallway that mirrors everything on the starboard side.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:08]** You see it extends up to a corner where it dead ends at the edge of the ship and two sets of double doors on your right as you begin to move up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** I roll perception.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:12]** Oof.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:16]** That's a nine plus five is a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:18]** Nine plus five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:21]** Look at the hallway, the doors, just see if anything looks out of place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:22]** Okay.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:27]** Nothing looks out of place looking down the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** It just looks like a hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** Roll cantrip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:35]** I would suggest to Lozu to come tightly follow with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:36]** Yes, sorry.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:40]** She says, I was revealing the map and making sure everything was good.

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:41]** Lozu was revealing the map?

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:43]** She's the bad guy?

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:43]** What?

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:45]** I'm the game master, she says.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:48]** She starts cackling.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:49]** Yeah, she's cackling.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:52]** The most dangerous animal is humans, she says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:54]** All right.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:59]** Here's cast detect magic through the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:01]** What's the rule?

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:02]** Oh, you have detect magic.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:05]** Give me a read down on detect magic.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:05]** Oh, dang.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:06]** Why didn't you say that?

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:07]** I was asking about that earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:09]** Well, we did all kinds of checks.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:12]** I mean, if none of those were hidden, then I didn't think it would.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:20]** All right, so you detect all magic spells, effects, items, and objects, including those on or affecting creatures you can see, as well as hybrid items in the area.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:27]** You can't detect magical traps in this way, as they are created with additional magic that wards them from this common spell.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:37]** Each round you concentrate on the same area, you can determine if one magic source you detect is from a spell, magic item, or other effect, and the caster level or item level of the effect.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:46]** You can't determine if there are magical sources in areas you can't see, well then this won't work, or if there was a magic source in an area at one time, but then has since expired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:53]** But it's up to one minute per level, so if you cast it now, we can then, like, cast it as you open the door...

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:54]** Okay.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:54]** Yeah.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:54]** I'll do that.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:59]** But you can cast it now and look at Lozu and see if anything happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:59 - 01:03:59]** All right.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:01]** So here's cast it.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:03]** Immediately just, like, about faces.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:04]** It just stares into Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:05]** Glares at Lozu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:07]** And then, yeah, why not?

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** Okay.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:11]** We'll carry that over into the room.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:11]** No, nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:17]** Rick is going to say, like, we need to split up and intercept.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** Tactically.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** Because that's the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:20]** Tactically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:20]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:22]** Mika's going to go with Rick here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:24]** Okay, so where are you guys going?

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:27]** Describe to me where you're looking, because I'm one for the listeners and two for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:34]** Similar to the cargo bay on the other side, there are two sets of doors on the same hallway, and the hallway comes to an abrupt end.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:42]** So as you're walking down the hallway, there's a door on the right, and then there's another door past that, and that's the end of the hallway.

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:50]** And we know from the other side that both doors enter the same large cargo space area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:50 - 01:05:12]** so the the plan here is to enter both doors at the same time okay and that way we're spread out and have better tactical doors at the same time are you writing this down what are we reaching is that what we're doing are we stacking up because really like we should stack up on one


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:19]** Well, I mean, tactically, you'd want to be able to get multiple perspectives and be able to pincer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:19]** Yes.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:25]** Lozu is going to look over at Dr. Okay and get on the other side of the door.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:28]** What does Lozu's armor meant?

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:36]** She is currently wearing a... Give me one second as I scroll back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:40]** I'm just worried that we have, like... She's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:47]** Like, she has on stuff that allows her to... No, but we have both of our guns in one corner.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:49]** What do you mean, both of your guns in one corner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:51]** Oh, he's saying Nico should go to the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:56]** Yeah, either he or myself should go to the other side.

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:57]** I'll go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:58]** Nico, you should move down.

**[01:05:58 - 01:05:59]** And Rick will say that.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:02]** He'll look at you and be like, the other gun should be at the other door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:03]** All right.


## Speaker_0

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:03]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:06]** And Lozu's also going to stay down there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:07]** Yeah, she's going to stay down there.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:07]** Cool.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** I think we're ready.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:09]** You are ready.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:12]** Okay, yeah, Lozu... That's how Rex says it.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:12]** We are ready!

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:19]** She has a flight suit station wear that gives her some... Turned into like a... Oh my god, I'm excited to see it.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:23]** This is going to be interesting for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:31]** So Nico, before he goes in, is going to put away one of his guns and he's going to draw his sword in his left hand and his blaster in his right.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:32]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:34]** Here's has the sword already out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:35]** Okay.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** Rick's got his artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:39]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:41]** Has his cost eject liquidator equipped.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:49]** And his detect magic is still passively sensing stuff as we go through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:51]** My heart's beating out of my chest.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:53]** This is going to be good.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** I can hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:56]** Yeah, it's... It's in the background.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:57]** It's good.

**[01:06:57 - 01:07:01]** We're either getting ready to listen to Heartquake, self-shoutout, Heartquake Saga.

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:02]** Heartquake Saga.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:04]** Check it out on Spotify.

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:07]** It's more... We're getting ready to...

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:08]** Some tasty licks.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:09]** That's right.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:14]** Or about ready to listen to Edge of Glory by Lady Gaga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:15]** It's definitely the latter.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:20]** I figure that was the best way to finally see what's going on with the relic because you're just on the edge of glory.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:22]** You called it, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:24]** So we're going to need you to sing it, Nick, as we enter the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** Don't actually sing it.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:29]** Not that I don't love your voice.

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:34]** We all love your voice because it's on the intro of the podcast.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:35]** But

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:41]** For this moment, I want you guys to picture that you're standing in front of the door.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:42]** You're waiting.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:44]** The doors haven't opened.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:45]** Are you opening them stealthily?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:47]** We talked about this a million times.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:48]** You can't stealthily open these doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:50]** You can't, but I can still ask if you want to make a stealth roll.

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:51]** So you're stealthy.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:54]** The door might not be stealthy, but you're stealthy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:58]** So Rick is actually going to hold an action to shoot if anything looks suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:07:58 - 01:08:00]** Can we trip the sensor?

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:02]** I have a question.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:03]** Okay.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:03]** Okay.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:09]** I want to propose that we rig these doors to... To explode.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:10]** No, no, no.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:15]** To open randomly a couple times where we're not around.

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:19]** And then it would appear that they're on the fritz.

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:24]** And then we sneakily come up to the door that opens...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:27]** I mean, we could stand back and just tap the button a bunch of times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:27]** That's what I mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:28]** Yeah.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:31]** If you want Lowe's, you can hold up her wrist and it'll open.

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** She doesn't need to be near.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:32 - 01:08:33]** We all have this.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:33]** We all have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:36]** No, you don't all have the doors open.

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:37]** Rick, you have one.

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:38]** You said we had the.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:40]** No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:41]** Let's make this clear.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:44]** I don't know how you guys misunderstood this.

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:48]** I thought we all had a code.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:53]** I did not say to you, she walked over to all of you and gave you a wrist implant.

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:58]** No, she said to you, here is the key card that opens all of them.

**[01:08:58 - 01:09:00]** I have a wrist feature.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:02]** Only two people on the ship have it.

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:03]** Me and the captain.

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:04]** That is what she said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:08]** Can I roll a memory check to see if the captain had his arm cut off or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:09]** He did not have his arm cut off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:11]** Okay, so we're good.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:18]** So Rick goes back and cuts his arm off.

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:20]** Take 20.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:20]** Take 20.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:21]** I like this plan.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:23]** So yeah, Rick's going to step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:25]** So you guys are going to step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:30]** Yeah, and then we're going to just scan the door and let him open and then do perception checks without...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:49]** All right fine why not Like I don't know if this is a good idea or not I was just fuck it So let me say this we dig doing ditching are you gonna let the door open and then not look in is that we're gonna do I Mean yeah, I'm gonna do like I'm gonna just listen in you're gonna listen.


## Speaker_0

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:50]** Oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:53]** Well, yeah, it's a due perception without looking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:55]** That's still listening, right?

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:56]** I'm not going to reveal it then.

**[01:09:56 - 01:09:57]** Can I smell it?

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:59]** Nico, are you moving or no?

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:01]** Are you going to stand up for the door or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:05]** Yeah, Nico, you're staying on the other side of that door as well, correct?

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:07]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:10:07 - 01:10:08]** The door is two squares.

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:09]** It's two squares.

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:10]** So are you going to move?

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:10]** Yeah.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:14]** So Nico is going to ask Lozu to move back behind the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:16]** She has to open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:17]** Yeah, she has to be right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:19]** I thought she gave us a key card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:20]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:21]** Oh, my gosh.

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:21]** We have a key card.

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:24]** Wait, one of us has a key card, though, right, John?

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:26]** And she has a wrist thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:27]** Yeah, Dr. O.K.

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:27]** has the key card.

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:29]** Okay.

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:32]** Nico's going to turn behind Lozu, and he's going to say, give me the key card, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:34]** She doesn't have a key card, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:36]** Nick, she doesn't have a key card.

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:37]** It is in her wrist.

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:39]** No, she gave the key card to Rick.

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:41]** Okay, Rick has it.

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:41]** I'm sorry.

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:42]** I misunderstood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:43]** I blame John.

**[01:10:43 - 01:10:45]** John confused all of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:46]** No, I actually forgot that Rick had it, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:49]** Okay, so Lozu has the card in her wrist.

**[01:10:49 - 01:10:50]** Implanted?

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:52]** And then she handed us a key card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:53]** It's implanted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:54]** It's implanted.

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:56]** She deputized us with the key card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:59]** She has a chip with a key card that unlocks it, yes.

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:02]** And she said only two people have the wrist implant, me and the captain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:05]** But there's a hundred of these cards.

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:06]** No, she didn't say how many cards there were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:09]** But if you want to ask her, you could.

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:12]** Just keep planting things until he accepts.

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:14]** John, we blame you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:15]** I'm picky.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:16]** I'm picky.

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:19]** So Dr. O.K.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:21]** and Rick are sharing one key card.

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:22]** Lozu has the other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:23]** She doesn't have a card.

**[01:11:23 - 01:11:24]** She has the chip.

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:24]** Dr.

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:33]** O.K., if you remember, you tried to pickpocket her, and this is the reason why you didn't find a card on her because she doesn't carry around a card.

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:34]** You see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:35]** This is how you get space lights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:38]** This is how you get space lights.

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:44]** All right, now that my heart's been going for several minutes now, we can discuss the finer details of who has a biochip and who doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:45]** All right, so Nico, move out of the way of the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:47]** All right, Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:51]** I mean, we don't have... Can we move Rosewood back behind the... Oh, man.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:53]** I'm sorry.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:55]** Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:56]** What is going on, Nick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:58]** Well, all right.

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:00]** How about, okay, wait.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:02]** Or how about a new plan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:05]** All right.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:11]** Oh, this is going to be rich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:14]** We go in staggered.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:22]** Just like one person goes in with a distraction and the other person tries to sneak in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:28]** Not that I think I'm the best person with the most health, but I think I could hold someone's attention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:30]** Yeah, I agree.

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:31]** I was going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:32 - 01:12:36]** I don't have any stealth, so I'm just going to be big guns in the corner.

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:37]** Leave it to rapid shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:41]** Leave it to quick fire and misstep.

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:42]** Quick fire and misstep.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:45]** I don't have stealth either, really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:47]** So what are you guys thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:49]** I have a minus one for stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:50]** The lights are slowly flickering.

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:52]** The hallway is quiet.

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:52]** Fuck it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:54]** Leroy Jenkins.

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:56]** Leroy!

**[01:12:56 - 01:12:57]** Leroy!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:01]** You got that sound clip queued up, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:02]** Yes, sir.

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:03]** That was pretty close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:11]** It's got a clip, because it actually clips in the audio from the... There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:11]** I love that clip.

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:12]** I really do.

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:13]** Excellent.

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:14]** Excellent, excellent, excellent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:15]** Damn it, Leroy.

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:17]** Damn it, Leroy.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:19]** God dang it, Leroy.

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:24]** All right, I'm going to reveal it, and I will tell you guys what you see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:29]** All right.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:32]** So we're going back to the original plan of just opening the door?

**[01:13:32 - 01:13:32]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:32 - 01:13:33]** I thought I was going in.

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:34]** No, we're just all going to go in.

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:36]** I don't understand the communication.

**[01:13:36 - 01:13:39]** We're really doing a good job today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:40]** We're shouting down the hallway right now.

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:41]** Guys!

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:42]** You go first!

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:43]** No, I'm going to go first.

**[01:13:43 - 01:13:45]** Take your key cards.

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:46]** We all have key cards.

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:48]** What are you talking about?

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:49]** We all have key cards.

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:50]** It's fine.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:54]** Rick pushes the up button on his speaker volume.

**[01:13:55 - 01:13:56]** Guys, I need you to enter first.

**[01:13:57 - 01:13:59]** I will shoot from behind.

**[01:13:59 - 01:14:00]** Nico's going to go in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:01]** Fuck it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:03]** And he turns the volume back down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:03 - 01:14:05]** I'm going to open the door.

**[01:14:05 - 01:14:07]** So Nico just went in.

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:09]** So Nico is going to go in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:12]** He did Leroy Jenkins.

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:14]** I got sick of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:16]** I'm going in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:18]** All righty.

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:20]** God dang it, Nico.

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:24]** This is what happens when you overanalyze your combat.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:26]** You guys got to keep yourselves on a short leash here.

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:29]** Call me Quickfire Leroy.

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:32]** Quickfire Jenkins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:34]** More like Quickfeet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:35]** All right.

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:36]** Quickfeet Jenkins.

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:41]** Finally, at last, you get to go into the port cargo bay.

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:44]** It looks similar.

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:45]** Hang on.

**[01:14:45 - 01:14:49]** It looks similar to the starboard cargo bay.

**[01:14:50 - 01:15:02]** Several crates, however, within the cargo bay have been opened and their contents, cheap trade goods and mass produced trinkets are spilled across the area.

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:10]** But there's one large container, though, in the center that's been separated.

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:12]** Nico, don't move.

**[01:15:12 - 01:15:13]** I'm reading what's going on.

**[01:15:14 - 01:15:15]** I'm reading what's going on.

**[01:15:15 - 01:15:16]** Move yourself back.

**[01:15:17 - 01:15:18]** Move yourself back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:23]** For the listeners, Nico's mercury is slowly moving.

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:24]** Don't move, buddy.

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:26]** Don't move.

**[01:15:26 - 01:15:27]** Don't move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:35]** All I want is a clean description of the cargo bay with no interruptions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:37 - 01:15:37]** No.

**[01:15:38 - 01:15:39]** And I can't get it.

**[01:15:39 - 01:15:41]** I have to re-record this whole episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:58]** One large container, though, has been separated from the rest, and its computerized locks have been destroyed, its physical latches bent out of place, and one of the sides is flat on the floor.

**[01:15:59 - 01:16:06]** And there's a small silvery box on a pedestal sitting inside.

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:18]** The box's smooth sides are nearly identical except for a biometric scanner on one side.

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:21]** Nico, you're the first to see this.

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:36]** And that also means that you're the first to see that from inside this crate and the darkness, there's a figure that steps out from behind the plinth.

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:41]** The haggard look in her eyes and bruises on her face.

**[01:16:42 - 01:16:45]** You see Algiata Eome, and that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:54]** Oh, is this the real one or the fake one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:54]** Okay, guys.

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:56]** Nico Ryan here.

**[01:16:56 - 01:16:58]** I don't know if I agree with this decision.

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:06]** Those captives could easily come up behind us and slit our throats when we're not even looking.

**[01:17:07 - 01:17:14]** To add insult to injury, we finally find Algiada in her room...

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:16]** balled up in this cargo container.

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:23]** Now, I'm willing to see it through because I need to figure out what's going on here, but something's just not right.

**[01:17:23 - 01:17:26]** In any case, Nico Orion signing off.

**[01:17:27 - 01:17:30]** See you next time on Will Save.
