## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:12]** Hello friends.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:21]** Welcome to my channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:22]** I'm cutting that out.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:26]** Welcome to We'll Save the Buckethead.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:27]** We'll Save.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:29]** We'll Save.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:29]** Episode 125.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:31]** It's a We'll Save party.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:33]** Yeah, it's a We'll Save party.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:36]** I am your Jurassic GM, John Swan.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:40]** I'm joined by my Triassic heroes here.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:44]** Anyway, it's Will Garrett, Kevin Decker, and Kelly Gilliam.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:47]** Even though the Triassic and the Jurassic were separated by like hundreds of millions of years, right?

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** Is that true?

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** Well, I feel like it's pretty far.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:54]** It's like Cleopatra is closer to them than we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:55]** No, no, no.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:58]** She's closer to us than she was to the building of the pyramids.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** To the Jurassic period?

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:01]** Little did we know.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:04]** I think we're all pretty far from the Jurassic period.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** That's like, it's a while back.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** A few reptoids removed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** But how far were the pyramids from the Jurassic period?

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** Cool, yeah.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** Did the dinosaurs live at the same time?

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** I feel like they did.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:14]** Question!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** They helped build the pyramids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:18]** Here's my theory is that dinosaurs built the pyramids.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:19]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:22]** Not that T-Rex said he can't do shit with his little hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** I thought it was just people.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** Well, not all of them have little arms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:29]** No, they just took their tails and they all...

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** They all lifted the tails together.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** That's how they lifted stones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:48]** There's actually a YouTube channel of one dude who is using simple machines to move these super heavy stones into place and showing the concept of what it would actually look like to do that with simple machines.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** It's pretty cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:56]** I mean, there's some giant walls on the temple mount that are just single slab, man.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:59]** They're huge.

**[00:02:59 - 00:02:59]** And how do they do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** Stonehenge.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:02]** Stonehenge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** There's a lot more in Stonehenge, too.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** It's crazy.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:31]** ancient people were just like us you know they were probably podcasting speaking they were they were podcasting just just in their community talking playing what were they playing randomly dice hinges henge and hexes speaking of monuments and playing stuff uh civ 6 is on mobile now thanks to Netflix oh really dang how thanks to Netflix I've been playing civ 6 on my phone

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:33]** How do you navigate those menu trees?

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:38]** That is like, there's so much there, and you're just looking at your 6.1-ish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:40]** The UI is actually pretty good.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:40]** It's a lot.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:41]** There's a lot.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:42]** But it's pretty good.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:47]** The click and drag aspect of it's a little weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:51]** Because my phone wasn't already enough of a time suck, now we're going to put save on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** Well, that's what they want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:53]** I know, right?

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:57]** I spent most of Christmas Day ignoring my family and playing Civ VI.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:07]** I break out my old, my grandpa's iMac, and I play his existing Civ II game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:07]** Wow.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** Wait, that's awesome.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** Oh, nice.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:11]** Is it all by command line?

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** No, it's just Civ II.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** I mean, it's kind of good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** Handwritten by Sid Meier.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** Sid II.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** I don't think there's ever been a more legendary one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** I think that's the most iconic one.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** 96.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** And it was, it's really iconic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** I don't know.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:29]** I'd say Age of Empires is pretty iconic, but it was different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** It was definitely different.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** But that's true.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** That's true.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** It's very different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:35]** Civ 7 comes out in like a month.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:39]** I still am annoyed that you have to manually like redo farms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** Yeah.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:44]** I played Civ 5 exactly once.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:57]** I installed it and I started playing and I looked up after 80 turns and it was 3 o'clock in the morning and I had to go to work.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:57]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:21]** i was like no cool never again always dude that's how they get you just one more turn dude it's only two more turns until you like unlock banking so come on you know like what's six hours nothing yeah it's like five more turns until you get to the like space age so you might as well i'm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:41]** i'm so bad at it oh it'll get to like the world congress and i still have like slingers and warriors with like clubs and slings well look i'm like what am i doing wrong here what do you spend your time doing yeah dude are you going for the culture victory i have the great lighthouse i i have the great lighthouse you're going with the wonders of the world man that's that's that culture victory dude


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:41 - 00:06:05]** you're the civilization that they that they like fly over and they're like oh look at this untouched civilization we don't want to disturb them you're like the aboriginal tribes of new game that's an interesting strap actually that is what makes you not conquered catch up from behind yeah yeah that's right yeah yeah but you have to make it through a lot of ages before you get there before they decide not to conquer you that's true


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:27]** good long game kevin i like that well speaking of clicking more more more turns hypothetical question if you could have a button and you push it and it does something what is that something what does it do for you what would that something be well i would want it to make for me


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:33]** Is the idea that we should be reusing it because it's like a reusable feature?

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:36]** Can it just be like a one-time thing and I never have to press it again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:36]** You can do it.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:41]** I mean, with any hypothetical, I expect to really dive into the weeds.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** You can use it as many times as you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** You push the button and something happens.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:51]** I want to press it and then become an immortal cyborg that still looks like me.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** That's what I want to do.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** Every time?

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** As a cyborg that looks exactly like myself.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:56]** Each time?

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:58]** Well, we just said one time.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** I don't need to press it once.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:03]** Well, but what if you're... I want to turn people into cyborgs a little.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:06]** I'll make you all cyborgs.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** I would rewind time.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** Well, they'll know because you won't age.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:16]** You'll realize that you can't be squished by something over time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** Of course, Will goes with the time.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** I would rewind time 12 hours.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:23]** So every time you push it is 12 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:29]** So if you wanted to go back a week, you just go... I feel like 12-hour increments is good enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:36]** It's small enough to be useful for small things, but you can still mash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** And not fatigue myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:43]** This one's weird, but... Back to a time where you didn't have the button?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:47]** I would assume that it would travel with me, but... Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:50]** Let's assume, for the sake of argument, it stays with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** Because it's hypothetical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:53]** Anything could happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Even if that weren't the case, though.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** Just to...

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** It would still be useful.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** I would just have to wait 12 hours.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:04]** The max that I could go to would be the time that I received it at.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** That's true.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:07]** But then I could still, you know, like day trade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:08]** Day trade.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** Oh, dude.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:10]** Oh, dude.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** Yes.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:14]** That's like that show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** There was some show.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** What was his name?

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:22]** There was a show where he would receive tomorrow's newspaper the day before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** That was a great show.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** Yeah.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:30]** And then he tried to use it to bet or to bet on sports, but then that would change.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:37]** So he mostly just used it to solve murders or prevent bad things happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** That'd be useful too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** Early edition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** Good show.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** Kev, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:44]** What a clever name.

**[00:08:45 - 00:09:01]** My button would deliver the healthiest version of whatever food I was craving at the time, but it would deliver it to everyone in the world, which would feed the homeless and everything, but at the same time, probably just annoy people.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:02]** Yeah, it would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:08]** You'd be like, at dinner, and then everybody would pop up and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** It's always mac and cheese, too.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:14]** Yeah, it's the one that you crave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** That's the thing.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:18]** Vegan mac and cheese.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** Vegan mac and cheese.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:25]** Yeah, Dr. Pepper tastes like actual Dr. Pepper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:28]** That actually would be pretty good.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** I enjoy being skinny.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:36]** I loathe working out, and so I would have a button that immediately loses one pound of fat.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Awesome.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** I can get behind that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:42]** You would just mash it until it's nothing and then... Well, not until it's nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:46]** But then you can eat as much as you want.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:50]** You need fat to process your emotions and stuff.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** But hit it until I'm happy and then go do things.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:57]** In the winter, I'd probably let it go a little bit so I can stay warm.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** And then it's time to go to the beach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** And the frigid Florida winters.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** It doesn't get cold where you are, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** Yeah, I'm currently in Illinois.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** It's cold as .

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:12]** It's actually not that cold this week, but yeah.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:16]** Last time I was here, there were a couple of snowstorms, so yeah.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Yikes.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Yeah.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** John, what would your button do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:50]** you know i since i since i chose this i have struggled with an answer because i'm like do i do something outrageous right do i like make everyone like to cat's point do i like make everyone fart at the same time you know just like why not you know like great you know but the capacity for good is is too uh oh is uh is is too optimal there so i feel like i would

**[00:10:50 - 00:11:15]** your point will on like time is what i'm always going after so i feel like if i could give somebody a discreet amount of time myself included i would so it might not be going 12 hours back but it could be like if you need a few extra hours in the day i can give it to you if you wanted like if i need a few extra hours that's what i'm saying 12 hours every day yeah like yeah crazy right yeah it would be awesome

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:24]** Look, there there is, of course, the like world peace, solving world hunger, solving all the problems, which like, you know, think if you're presented with that opportunity, you can consider it.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:26]** But if we're just talking to that with time, though,

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** You could also do that.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** You could be like, oh, you know what?

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:32]** I'm going to give a few extra hours to these researchers.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:37]** Well, I don't know about that, but I would, you know, like, well, you don't have to get into it.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:41]** Well, I figured that you're an immortal being, so you have, you could take the time to solve it.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** This is fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:47]** Well, that's why I want to be immortal with the button is so that I can just travel with Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:51]** Simply meant that you could, you could like point out like this experiment's going to fail.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** So just do this, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:55]** Like, yeah, that's it.

**[00:11:55 - 00:12:20]** you that conversation's pretty wild you just show up to the lab hey i know what's gonna happen yeah well just let me hang out believe me i have a button guys i've got a button yeah uh just let me push it and i promise you i can tell you what's gonna happen nice yeah so what so what's your answer i don't think you all want to what what's your alls being able to to give people a few hours of extra time in their day yeah

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:24]** With that said, I don't think you all want to go back 12 hours from where you are now.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:27]** I think you're happy as your characters.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:30]** You are happy where you are now.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:40]** Mash it a few weeks, and then... I don't want to say happy, maybe, but you're more content with where you are than where you were even just less than two hours ago.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** Less than two hours ago...

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:58]** You were hauling ass outside of Tier Cal's base in spectacular fashion, doing whips in the car, hitting barrels to hit people, about to get slammed with a staff from the stewards leader of the base.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:01]** And then they're like, nah, I'm good.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** Not going to do that.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:07]** You, as you're leaving, realizing that they're not chasing you.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:10]** You think, oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** They probably figured we don't need to.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** They're going to die out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** Well, they still have the truck.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:21]** I'm very curious what the T'Kalas kill switch was.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:33]** And we won't know as characters because it was like a cinematic zoom in on Hurd's chest when he pushed the button that said T'Kalas kill switch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:37]** I just assumed it had something to do with the... No, we did.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:39]** We did hear explosions when we left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:40 - 00:14:07]** it was no we heard explosions during the attack you know the starship battle going on in the group in the garage we didn't hear an explosion after the button did we hear an explosion i thought we did i can't john is shaking his head so no i don't remember that happening so cool there are a lot of details in the threefold conspiracy so don't worry yeah it's all good and we've been at it for a long time um so

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** As you're leaving, you're talking about what to do.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** You guys are cruising.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:15]** The adrenaline is coming off of you in waves.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** You're cruising, starting to talk.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:23]** Realize that there's a map in your police cruisers.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:24]** Steward cruisers.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:26]** Stusers.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** You're cruising in your stusers.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:36]** And you realize, well, we want to go to the prison.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:38]** I think that's an option.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:42]** Maybe free prisoners, maybe it's a place of refuge, who knows?

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Also,

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:51]** Kiers, you realize that you can actually see some of the ping of the Voidcrier.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** You can ping it.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** And you can see that it's moving in a southeast direction.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:58]** When you look at the map, you realize that it's likely headed towards Terrapin Station.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:05]** Terrapin Station, where all the communications are being funneled out of Tyrkos.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:08]** And in this general vicinity... Is that a hardline funnel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:12]** Like, is there a cable running along the path that we're taking...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:20]** I wouldn't say that there's a cable, but it is an industrial level connection that they are able to make happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** So it's not just some kind of wireless thing.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:29]** So we can actually see, can we see the infrastructure that they're using to transmit to Terrapin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** No, you can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:38]** So you say, well, let's go to Terrapin because lava-proof cable.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:40]** That was honestly what was in my head.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** I don't know that they have a lava-proof cable.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:47]** Maybe at Starfinder they can, or they're shooting it up to a discrete geosynchronous satellite.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** I don't know.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:51]** But the point is...

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:54]** You say, well, we don't know who's on the Void Crier.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:58]** Likely, it's at least Orvir and Dr. Rald Nodens.

**[00:15:59 - 00:15:59]** Maybe there are some others.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:00]** Who knows?

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** Maybe that's something that we need to investigate.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:06]** And also, that's the only ship that we know is here.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:09]** And at least we can find a way to get comms off.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:13]** Because right now, anything that you send out is going to go right through Terrapin and you don't know what's going to happen.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:16]** And maybe you don't want to send any comms to Terrapin.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:17]** Right?

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** You don't want them to know that you're out there.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:20]** Who knows?

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:20]** Who knows?

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:27]** You are cruising, you change course, start heading down.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:38]** Dr. O'Kay, you're stopping, stopping for just a little breather, a little stretch, maybe look to see if there are any snacks in the back trunk, you know?

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:47]** Dr. O'Kay, you find a book that's a medical text that was written by Dr. Novinci, who worked with Dr. Proustakis.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:51]** And Dr. Da Vinci and inside is a note from Dr. Nodens.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:58]** Sorry, a note from Dr. Da Vinci saying, Rell, please come to see me on Rose Light anytime.

**[00:16:59 - 00:16:59]** Dr. Da Vinci.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:03]** You keep cruising.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** The landscape changes.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:35]** and there are no roads trackless landscape that you're traveling across you start to notice that you're coming into a basin and there is a lava river that you pull up to and as you stop on a little inlet that is right at the middle of the river doctor okay well


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:37]** I just want to do life science.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** Identify.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:49]** As you do, you see this large herd of creatures, maybe 10, including some children, that look like rhinos with sort of split heads.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:57]** And they are just walking in the lava, heading upriver.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** I'm going to bring you guys to the map.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:03]** What do we have with split heads?

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:06]** Sort of like a hammerhead shark kind of head.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:10]** These things are pretty awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:11]** I don't know what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** They are huge creatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:18]** Also, I can't see anything on the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:18]** Wait, really?

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:19]** Yeah.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:21]** It's all black.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:24]** Again, I put your characters on screen, but I hid them.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** Can you see now?

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** Really?

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** I see a mouse moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:35]** Okay, that's really interesting.

**[00:18:36 - 00:19:03]** that's interesting to know for all you found your people if you hide your tokens then you then you can't see so when i hide yours you can't see i i just hid because i didn't want to assume you guys were standing outside the vehicles but i have to in order for you guys to see anyway so your vehicles pull up and you see these jurassic animals dr okay what's your life science check 25 solid these are lava striders


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:27]** huge herd animals that are native mostly to volcanic planets or moons are they friendly they are herd animals that right now are indifferent they don't really know could i tame one and write it into and write it terrapin station


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** If you would like to.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:34]** They are currently indifferent.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:38]** And they don't really see humans, so they don't really know what to do.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:39]** They're not skittish.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:45]** But you can assume that if you provoke them, that wouldn't be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:49]** Yeah, I'm not going to provoke a herd of wild animals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:51]** Do you want to kind of...

**[00:19:52 - 00:20:10]** bring the vehicle forward a little bit and stop off on an island and or or just try and approach right now can we just go around there's no way to go around you're at the thinnest point in the river right now it funnels into this little area it's about 70 80 feet across right so this seems like the only navigable point of the river

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:12]** And they're just chilling there?

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:13]** They are just chilling a bit.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:21]** They are like pulling some of the lava up and it's just hitting their hide and leaving no mark.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:28]** And they're kind of washing themselves, just taking a moment, walking, moving around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:34]** What does, pray tell, this creature diet consist of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:42]** They are mostly eating vegetarians, so whatever roots they can find that grow.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:46]** They are like camels in that they don't need to eat for a long time.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** They can hibernate.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:54]** But they are used to low caloric intake in pretty extreme environments.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:59]** Sometimes there are creatures deep in the lava rivers that they can go down and wriggle out and eat.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:03]** Pretty intense animals, honestly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:10]** Here's, can you use your ghost sound to lure them away from our path?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:14]** Well, I could certainly give that a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:19]** Yeah, what would I know of their, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:43]** habitat that would mimic either a predator or something that they want to go after the mating call just google the call of a lava strider that's what i do did you do you not want to try and approach it because i'm happy to let you try and approach the creature and ride it if you would like it seems like a dangerous gamble call me crazy


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:52]** But a herd of animals bathing in lava seems like something that an Osharu would try to avoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** It's Lion King.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** We got to jump from their back and swing from their horns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** Okay.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** Yeah.

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:58]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:01]** Without... With ditching the vehicles?

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:05]** You know, Doctor... Yeah.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:13]** I would like... I would very much like to ride one of these if in a different circumstance, but...

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** I think we should try to...

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:19]** Try to just navigate through this without disturbing them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** With Dr.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** O.K.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:25]** 's superior piloting, and in this case, your knowledge of them, Dr.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:31]** O.K., as well, maybe you can provide me some idea about what sounds might attract them.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:35]** To Rick's point, I might be able to draw them in a certain direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** Yeah.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** Our powers combined can get through pretty well.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** Can I roll life science for that?

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:41]** Sure.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** Yeah.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** I'll set it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** You can.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** I'll help with that.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:51]** Okay, good, because I rolled a very middling roll of 22.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:51]** 22?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:52]** Okay.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** Kelly?

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** I assist.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** Okay, so it's 24.

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:58]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:03]** Yeah, you're confident that you have found a noise.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** You're what?

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:08]** You're just trying to get them to clear out of the way so that way you can make it across?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:11]** Okay.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Yeah.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** What noise do you find?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:30]** I'm asking, is it a pleasant noise, or is it a... Like, I don't want to work them into a frenzy, so I'm going to be trying... Yeah, a predator noise wouldn't probably be the best, because then you don't know where they're going to run, even if, like, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** It's, yeah.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:34]** Best not to, you know, get them all scared.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:35]** That's for sure.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:39]** So maybe there's something that you can...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:39 - 00:24:09]** though if you made it a predator noise from us if you just projected a predator noise from us then we would be the predators right but we don't but how do they deal with predators cause some herd animals will attack and they're gonna defend their young and that's not great yeah let's just kill the young one and then just kidding and that is your murder bot moment that's your murder bot moment for today for episode 125 that's it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:34]** yeah that was it you uh you're never gonna shit that skin man unless you take someone else's skin could you could you could you could you indicate the noise that they make john the noise that they are making well what kind of noise would attract them i'll do it what kind of noise would attract them kelly


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** I don't know.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:38]** I'm asking you.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** I'm asking you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:40]** Okay.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:45]** What are their sensory perceptions even?

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:48]** Can they even hear things?

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:48]** Yes.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:49]** They can hear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** They can feel vibrations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:53]** Are they attracted to any noises?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:54]** Yes.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** There are noises that they can be attracted to.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** Perhaps it's a mate.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** Perhaps it's another herd.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:03]** Perhaps it's some sort of food that they hear a little further way down the river.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** Could be anything.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** Could be any one of those.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** They're into plant life.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** So what plant life is making noises?

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** Plants and animals.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:14]** There are some animals that they can reach down and grab.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** So they are omnivores.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** They just huff.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:18]** That's all they do.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:19]** Oh, my God.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:23]** Have you guys heard about Los Angeles squirrels turning carnivorous?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:23]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:24]** Yeah, I have.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** It's pretty wild.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:28]** Back to Lava Striders, the real deal.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:32]** So you all make a noise.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:34]** What is the noise that you want to make with ghost sound?

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:36]** And where do you want to make it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:42]** Apparently, the mating noise, I have to make it, unfortunately, because it's my spell.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:46]** But it's basically like a... That's how they... Apparently.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:47]** I don't know.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** That's how they get into the fuck, at least.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:51]** It's not that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:53]** It's like a braying donkey.


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:59]** All right.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:01]** But my range is only 40 feet on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** So you can steer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** I don't know where.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** Roll diplomacy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:08]** Yeah.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:11]** Let's try to get them.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** Just point on the map where you do it.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** I'm going to put them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** Probably here's where I can do it.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** Right where the waterfall of lava is.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** I don't see a background.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:25]** I only see the layer of twinkling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** Oh, you don't see the map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:30]** If I do 40 from this... Wait, really?

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:32]** Well, I'm just going to send them...

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:33]** The best thing to do.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** No, I only see that.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:39]** From this car is to send them north because that will get them the most out of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:42]** So what is all this area down here?

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** It's like, yeah, I don't know what else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:45]** It's a waterfall of lava.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** Apparently there's a donkey.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:46]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** It's a lava.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** Yeah, they're going to go into the lava.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** Well, maybe they're into that.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** Maybe they're into that.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** Yeah, maybe they're into it.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** Maybe they're into it.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** Maybe it's sexy.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** All right.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** So here's going to cast a ghost sound.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:27]** okay so you're doing it where kelly you're you're doing it near near the lava yeah this is what here's is gonna do though he wants everyone to join in just to get into the spirit of it and like help help project it i'm like thinking that this will help i mean isn't it like a spell you cast it up if i remember correctly how is us making the sound it is it's like a cantrip going to only backfire into them coming towards us confidence


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** Kelly just doesn't want to do it alone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:34]** Nailed it.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:37]** I'm going to close the windows and just quietly do it with me.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** That way I don't feel alone.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:41]** I feel really shy about this.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:45]** It actually sounds kind of similar to sharing mating noises and I feel really vulnerable.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:52]** I feel like sharing mating noises would be like a chittering.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:54]** Yeah, I know, I know.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** I mean, it sounds like that to you, but we are very sensitive here.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** Don't leave me.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:04]** It just sounds like... All right, everyone together with me.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** All right, come on.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** I'm going to cast it now.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:15]** All right, repeat after me.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** It's just you, man.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** You guys all suck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:18]** Come on.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:20]** You're leaving me hanging by myself.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:24]** If I make noise, they're just going to come here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:24]** Just Kelly.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:29]** With just Kelly's voice.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** With just Kelly's voice.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** With just yours voice.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:36]** All right, fuck all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** Wow, thanks a lot.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:40]** Rick letting me down again and everyone else.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** All right, so I can't.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:44]** He did it towards the last one.

**[00:28:45 - 00:29:13]** and let's just say this is a very sexy noise it's not just yeah it's every gender and everything in between it covers all the frequencies i'm just saying yeah it does yeah totally yeah totally yeah yeah it's like the turtle it's you know it's like a turtle doing it it's like it's fucking noise yeah it really is exactly so so it works right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** They turn.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** Is that the episode title?

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Turtle f*** noise?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** Turtle f*** noise.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Turtle sex noise?

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** Yeah.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** They turn.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** And they start.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:31]** Like, the babies don't.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:32]** Like, the kids don't.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** But the adults turn.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** A few of them start to walk over.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:40]** And then they all stop.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** The babies are curious.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** And their heads go up.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** There's something else they've heard.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** And then...

**[00:29:50 - 00:30:13]** they start to book it north just on mass they start running north past the noise they jump over the the lava waterfall of you know 10 or 15 feet and they just start running running running down the river even where it gets wider until they're out of sight it's at that moment

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:22]** that you all feel this, this like rumbling.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:23]** Lava flow.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:40]** And then you look behind you and you just see this, this giant gust of like sulfuric volcanic earth just rush towards you.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:43]** I need all of you to make a reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** We're inside the cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** You are inside the cars.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** Alright, cool.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** We're going to do reflex save then.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** Who is piloting?

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:51]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** and Colin?

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** Yeah.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** Make a piloting check.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** Oh, a separate piloting check?

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:01]** Yeah, you don't need to make a reflex save.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:03]** You can make a check.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** I got a 21.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** 21.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Okay.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** I got a 7.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** Benny?

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:10]** I got a 13.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:10]** Okay.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:14]** Kevin, or Rick adheres for a second.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:19]** You're lifted up out of your seat, but you're able to stay still.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:38]** However, Colin and Rick's vehicle does show forward five feet and then the bottom of the vehicle dips into the lava and you are going to take, let's see, three points of damage to your vehicle.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:42]** You can click on your vehicle and adjust your hit points from the lava.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** You look behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:46]** Aren't these hovers?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:47 - 00:32:10]** yeah but do hoverboards not work on water unless you have power it's difficult with the with the lava it's not the same at all yeah it's a difficult piloting check to to stay on the lava you look behind you and you see a mushroom cloud from a massive explosion in the direction of tircala space


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** Let's get the heck out of Dodge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:19]** Oh, there's the explosion that I thought I heard right after we left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:24]** I feel bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:27]** Talk about great timing, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:37]** Let's get... Well, with that, do you think there might be, you know, a lava tsunami or anything like that?

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:42]** We should probably just get it as far away as possible, as quickly as possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:47]** You think that you're almost at 50 miles away.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** It's visible.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** Yield on this nuke.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** Yeah.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:58]** You're not sure, but I'd say with some physical science, you know that if you keep going, you'll be okay.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:00]** You're not too worried.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** Put your thumb up.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** That's how you do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:10]** In order to get across this river, you are going to need to give me piloting checks.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:18]** You can move 25 feet around and it will take three to four rounds depending on where you go to get across.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:26]** And as you saw with the vehicle, you will suffer damage if you don't quite nail your piloting check.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** You will suffer some damage.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:30]** This is extremely dangerous.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:35]** Well, Dr. OK is a better pilot than yours, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** If I'm not mistaken.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:40]** And he's doing good so far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** That's my route.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:43]** How good are you at piloting?

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:44]** Me?

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** On a scale of like 1 to 20.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:47]** Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:47 - 00:34:00]** My piloting skill is... I would have to say on a scale of 1 to 20, about a plus 8.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** That's pretty good.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** We should swap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:11]** Let's just get out real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:14]** What's your piloting skill?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:20]** Uh, I took, uh, five units in college.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:24]** I took a little bit more.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** I guess I'll steer.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:28]** Continue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** I'll help as much as I can.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:32]** We can assist with piloting, right?

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:35]** I'll try to help.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:41]** Let's choose the safest route, I think.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** However we can accomplish that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:52]** If you choose routes where you will end your turn on or pretty much near the little islands of rock, that makes the DC a little easier.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:53]** Yeah.

**[00:34:54 - 00:35:19]** this is i don't know if y'all can see i can't i can't see your my path can you all control the vehicles you're doing you can right uh yeah i can somehow okay yep cool i'm able to control them yep all right i think i can't i don't see did you move all the starters off the map completely yeah i did they ran away they are running off in the distance they're still running


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:20]** Whoops.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:23]** I'm not trying to sink us off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:24]** Whoa!

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** All right.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** So who wants to go first?

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Let's decide and order.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** You can roll an initiative if you would like.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** Otherwise, you can just decide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:36]** I think Colin and Rick are closest to the first island.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:37]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** They got one toe in the fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** Sounds good.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:46]** So how many moves can I... What's the distance that I can move on this thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** 25 feet.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:47]** 25 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** I'll try that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** And each square is how many?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:50]** Five feet.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** You need to roll piloting for that?

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** Give me a piloting check.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** I need you to roll piloting.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** Are you going to... 22.

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:00]** Here, hold off on moving your token, Doctor, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** Yeah.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** I just pulled up to the first island.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:05]** And I successfully assisted him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** Okay.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** So 22, so 24, Kev?

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:09]** Yep.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:09]** Rick?

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:10]** Okay.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:36]** you are good to go let's move you back because i don't think that first island counts because they they fell in there yeah all righty where do you want to go do you want to wait for turns that way they move yeah uh the next island is farther than 22 north oh good call 25 feet yeah all right and now same thing 22 22.

**[00:36:36 - 00:37:01]** with with the assist with the assist okay you are good to go colin and rick you're good to go dr okay you want to go yeah so we'll go 25 across this first where they we're just going to follow the same tracks okay yeah that sounds good i can picture you guys tentatively just watching and i got a 22 22 okay and did you assist and okay excellent yes

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:28]** nailing it i love this the dice tell the story it makes sense that the first one over you pass it you're you're like adjusting the repulsors for how the lava stability is changing you're trying to get over one way you're slowly going over gunning it when you need to and then doctor okay maybe you're picking up on that on that data here stop rick before you go back before you do it and and you're going over rick 19 what did you get on your roll


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:30]** I rolled a two for a total of 10.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Nope.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:31]** Sorry.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:31]** It's nine.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** Nevermind.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:35]** It's a nine for a total of 17, 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** Did you assist?

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:37]** Yes.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** So 19.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:43]** And you landed there, uh, here before you tell me Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:43]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** I got a 19 unassisted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** One sec, Dr. Okay.

**[00:37:52 - 00:38:06]** Kev and Rick, 19, and Colin, you take 10 points of damage to your vehicle as you start to, just as you think, because for the listeners, there are two big islands kind of in the middle and right on the right side.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:12]** They're going from left to right, and there's a cluster of little islands up to the top, and they're going to kind of go horseshoe around.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:18]** They're going to go across the first island, up like a great circle arc, and then back over, or at least straight over.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** And that second path, something about it.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** You thought you knew where it was.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:30]** And you can hear the vehicle material just being eaten away by this lava.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:32]** It was just, we're too close to the lava fall.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** It splashed onto us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:34]** Yeah.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** It wasn't rich piloting at all.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** Definitely not.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:41]** Doctor, okay, you got, sorry, you got a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:42]** I got a 19 unassisted.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** Unassisted.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:47]** I'm assuming here's assisting for 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** Okay.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:53]** Yeah, I do.

**[00:38:53 - 00:39:08]** You are following their footsteps, but that, they're taking damage and they're moving, pushed some sort of wave in the lava and it collides into the side of one of your wheel wells and your vehicle will take five points of damage.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:08]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** God, Rick.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** Rick.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** What?

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:14]** Get to the shore and we'll follow you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:17]** I think, yeah, there's one more turn for Colin and Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** That's even worse.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:22]** That's 14 on the die, or 14 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:26]** And that assist does not succeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:28]** Oh, even worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:33]** Tell us the damage.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** Do you want to know?

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:35]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** No, we don't, John.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:40]** Whatever you're about to say, we don't want to know it.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** Which of you wants to die?

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:49]** We just like Terminator 2 style.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** It's the only way to kill Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:56]** Colin and Rick, your vehicle takes 32 points of damage.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** Oh, we're good.

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:02]** As you just crash into the lava.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:10]** And the only way you make it out is by just the sheer momentum of the vehicle pushing you up onto shore.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:15]** And there's just lava that's even starting to almost burn through some of the windows.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:17]** It got high.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** It got high up on the side of the vehicle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** The whole thing is gone now.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** The two of us are just balanced on one repulsor.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:26]** We have five points left.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:29]** Turn it into a motorcycle.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** Turn it into a motorcycle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** We turned it into a unicycle.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** But you successfully got over.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:36]** You successfully got over.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:39]** First vehicle to get over, Dr.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** O.K., I hope you don't have the same issue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** You got to put some air quotes around that successfully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** So...

**[00:40:45 - 00:41:08]** failing the first the first row with this little like hop on this tiny island yeah yeah yeah little rock jumper what's your roll i got a five on the die for 12 which is a 14 i think it would assist if if kelly assists what kelly do you sis do you sis


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:12]** What's the threshold to assist again?

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:13]** 12?

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:16]** No, what's the threshold?

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** What succeeds in assist?

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:20]** Then I do, just apparently.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:21]** Okay.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:22]** I do assist.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** So 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:27]** Like rally cars, it's just here's doing this, waving his hand back and forth.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** Left three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Left three.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:34]** Yeah.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** Straight.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** Right two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:45]** Okay, your vehicle takes 23 points of damage, making it to that last bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:48]** All right, and then we still have one more, but I'm going to go a different route.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:49]** Okay.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:55]** Because I feel like this is a shorter distance than this...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:17]** yeah yeah that's fair because all all this square also is uh you know partially rock yeah right yeah so i'm gonna go here okay what's your role also i'm gonna take down your that was 23 points i said right yeah so make sure you take down your hit points um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:20]** 23 on the system.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:20]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:21]** Kelly?

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** I assist.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:23]** Okay.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** You are good.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:26]** You are good.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:29]** Make sure you adjust your hit points for that 23 points of damage.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** You made it across.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:33]** You waited until the lava has become stable.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** I'll do that.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** And you all make it across.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:40]** So, whoo!

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:40]** Wow.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:40]** Wow.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:42]** Wow.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** All righty.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:54]** Made it across an intense lava river in which one of your vehicles is very severely destroyed.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:57]** Ours isn't in great shape either, but... Both.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** Should we take a long break?

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** You just decide to rest now.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** Let's get away from the lava first.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:04]** Yeah.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Yeah.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:08]** Okay.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:08]** All righty.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:10]** How are you feeling?

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:14]** Oh!

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:14]** Uh... Scared?


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** How many people can these vehicles hold?

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** Can I repair these cars?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:19]** Good question.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Do you have the stuff for it?

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** I mean, I'm good at engineering.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:29]** I think you could do a slight engineering check to bump up a nominal amount, which would be the worst thing.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:36]** But you definitely would need to be at a place where there's more


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:57]** equipment available to you in order to do it right we're i can't do it we're effectively trying to like rebuild an entire car on the side of the road yeah bernice only has a gun and a knife in her briefcase bernice we haven't heard from bernice she's just chilling in the back seat she's like all right yeah that's cool if i die i die


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:14]** right right the exact quote i was thinking i have any uh do you want to know what the damage was for this if you failed the check it is completely no on any failure it is yeah it's a it's a lot

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:17]** Well, in general, exposure is 4d6.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** Like your person is 4d6.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** Total immersion is 20d6.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:24]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** 4d6.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:30]** So it was 4d6 times 2?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** That's for you.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** That's just you.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Not your vehicle.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:41]** There's a whole separate setup for like per point of damage, you're losing a d6 of damage.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Got it.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:42]** Yeah, it's a lot.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** It's pretty crazy.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** Love is wild.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:52]** And you saw that dear callous base.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** It's blown up.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:53]** Gone.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** Just a crater where it used to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** Crater where it used to be.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:58]** You can't see it.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** You're close to 50 miles away now.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:06]** You can't see it exactly, but you can see that the cloud is still expanding up past the moon.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:09]** This is not a giant planet.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:12]** The atmosphere is pretty thin, so it's already starting to move out.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:15]** Let's get you guys back to the big map.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** Can we all move over to one vehicle?

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** Across the lava flow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** It's great.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:23]** We're only like 20% of the, or a 20th.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** Yeah.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** You know, it's cool.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** It's fine.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:35]** You're, you're good, but you did meet those lava striders, you know, that was definitely something that, uh, was an interesting feature of arrows.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:41]** And as, as we dreamt, you could maybe, uh, course them to be written.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:42]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** It's pipe dream.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:44]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:44 - 00:46:05]** thinking about if it's possible are we able to move like all of us into one vehicle i don't remember how many people each vehicle sits the like the reason we didn't go in one vehicle was because we were trying to get away i think only the the um the big car big car would have supported all of us


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** Yeah, this is three people total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** Okay, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:12]** And Dr. Okay and Here's Is is already full with Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:14]** Well, no, Bernice is in their car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** Yeah, Bernice takes over.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:18]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:22]** I just figured your guys' vehicle is healthier, so it would be better.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** Ignore me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:33]** Again, when you stop, there's probably a minimum amount of engineering and computers that you could do to try and rebalance things that I would say would give you a small buff.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** Might help.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** Yeah, I can help with that.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:39]** Yeah.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** You start cruising.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** Pick up the speed.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:48]** Again, 35 miles an hour, trying to watch all the craters, trying to make sure things are steady.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** What do you want to do right now?

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** Do you want to drive for a few more hours?

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** It's probably about six-ish.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** Still technically sunlight.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:13]** You could still drive at night for as long as you want because there's enough natural light from the planet Brithida that even though you don't have the actual sun and there's still some lava, you can see what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:18]** I feel like there's no disadvantage to resting right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:18]** Dr. Kemp?

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:24]** Am I under the assumption that this is like a ridge to the north of the base?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:33]** When you're looking at the map, yeah, you can see that Terrapin Station, there appears to be a pretty large, you know, there are craters dotting all over.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:38]** Right next to Terrapin Station, it seems to be some flats.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:41]** Seems to be a rather large crater with a couple of small ones in it.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:46]** There's a pretty craggy one up to the north left of that.

**[00:47:46 - 00:48:06]** here there are these two lakes that the river that you just crossed feeds into one of them and then you do notice this giant this giant uh like dark area and from your knowledge of maps and uh from just from what you can see you think those are cliffs how the heck are we gonna get down the cliff


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:13]** Well, yeah, I mean, I was going to try and just see... No, I feel like we should rest.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** Let's be reasonable here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:18]** We don't know what we're going to encounter between here and there.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Do we need to rest, though?

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:23]** Especially if something happens to the vehicle and some people get exposed.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** I thought you said that you needed to rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:33]** I was just going to... I wanted to make sure we were all topped off before we broke into the station.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:44]** And I was going to suggest that we pick a high point on the map to try and overlook the... If we could see it from even there.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** I don't know how.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** It's like 50 miles, right?

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** Probably low visibility.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** Yeah, you might be able to see it.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:52]** You might not.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** You are on the cliffs.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:55]** So again, you'll have to see how high those cliffs are.

**[00:48:55 - 00:49:01]** Maybe with that vantage point, you could see pretty far in the distance if it's not too hazy, if it's not an LA day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:08]** Yeah, I mean, I said we just book it for the cliffs and then go from there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:08]** Colin concurs.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** Maybe you'll encounter some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:14]** I think that as soon as we can, we should take a rest.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:20]** If people are any bit low on health and anything happens to that vehicle, we are then going to have to deal with things on foot.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** And I don't want to be surprised.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:26]** So I'm cool with like getting a good vantage point, but we should really hurry up on that.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:28]** I mean, we can try to repair the vehicle now, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** Do you want to take some time right now?

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:43]** You could probably, but I think before you could get to, like, if we're just talking the fact that in Starfinder rules, you need six hours of rest technically every 24 hours.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:46]** So if you're trying to push it, you know what I'm saying?

**[00:49:47 - 00:50:16]** oh we could like trade off no i wasn't saying trade off because the point is that you're all starting like you all started out with the same level and there are fatigue levels that you'll take if you stay up past that six hours which would not be good for checks that you'll have all day but my point is that like before you hit the point at which you should probably take a rest a long rest or start to feel fatigued is the cliffs that that's that's as good of a place as any for you to say all right let's you know all right let's book for the cliffs then

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:40]** for the cliffs and then rest there all right cool okay repair and do some stuff there too you start moving scenery's passing by it's not getting any prettier but it's certainly exotic alien you're on a literal volcano moon something is maybe in the back of your minds because as you're driving

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** Let me see.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:48]** and Colin, give me... Actually, all four of you, give me perception checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:54]** I got A. Where is perception?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:55 - 00:51:19]** is a 29 22 29 29 229 wow high perceptions high perception i mean there's not much going on for us not to like right again the dice tell the story it makes sense like they like you can see a lot of what's happening and something we're also looking for something

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** You are.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:20]** You are.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** You're on the lookout.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** Totally.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:38]** You start noticing in the distance of the varied landscape and horizon that you see before you, crag sharp edges, something starts to come up on your left as you're passing this massive lake of lava.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:43]** Something that looks not natural.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:49]** Looks like a perfect dome is starting to appear on the horizon.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:54]** You're like, and you're not that far from it.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:57]** Give me an intelligence check.

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:58]** Anybody?

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** You all saw it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:07]** Um, I got 19, 13, 19, 21, 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** Here's, uh, just a moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** Just a general intelligence, right?

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** Uh, 17, 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** Okay.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** I'd say, I think Dr. Okay.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** You probably remember this.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** Cause was it Dr. Okay.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:26]** Where the here's or the two of you were looking into the, uh, command center computer, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:27]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Yeah.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:41]** Because you remember seeing a file that noted that there was some structure out here in the wastes.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:47]** that they picked up and they saw on a satellite that there is some structure.

**[00:52:48 - 00:53:01]** And they pinpointed that as a location that had been, let's say, skimming communications off of their narrow band going from Tyrcalis to Terrapin.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:05]** There's some other structure that is tapping into that, feeding into that.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:17]** Don't know if it's sending, don't know if it's receiving and pulling data from that, but it's monitoring it's it's checking that comms channels and Dr. Okay.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:21]** You recall that, what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:28]** Should we go check out this dome before we, uh, for we head over?

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:33]** If they were... Our enemy might be a friend.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:34]** Exactly.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** I'm thinking the same thing.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** It also may provide cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:42]** And an opportunity for us to find out more.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:49]** If they've been skimming their communications for some time, maybe there's some intel here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Okay.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:52]** Colin?

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:53]** Pierce?

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** Makes sense to me.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:57]** You take...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:01]** Are we certain that this is a friendly... Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:01]** Probably not.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:04]** Probably the opposite of friendly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:06]** Yeah.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:09]** Could be friendly, could be not.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:18]** I guarantee that they got here somehow and will probably have some resources to repair our vehicles and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** Question for you.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:26]** Was the message a steward's message about their communications being skimmed?

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:30]** Or was it a reptoid message about it being skimmed?

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:33]** Because it's possible that this skimmer is the reptoid's skimmer.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:37]** And that's how they got so much information and were able to take over this space.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** That is possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** I agree.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:40]** That's possible.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:43]** When in the timeline did they discover it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** I think we should rest now.

**[00:54:45 - 00:55:13]** I think you know that without knowing too much about the history of Tyrcalis other than what they've told you, it seems on the more recent side that it was discovered and it's within the timeline from everything together of Steward and alleged Reptoid.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:18]** of noticing that their communications are being siphoned and monitored.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** I don't, I don't.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:25]** So it's before you think that the people there that you were speaking with notice this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:27]** Okay.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:42]** So post body snatchers, they understood that, uh, there is something going amiss, something being monitored from this location is a safe assumption.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** Perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** Okay, well, f*** it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** We're going to find out anyway.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** It is a place to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** Yeah, we're going to go anyway.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** We'll figure it out.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** It'll be a terrible idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:55]** You could also not.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** You could rest in the vehicles.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** That's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:58]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** We should rest in the vehicles.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:03]** Do you need rest?

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:04]** You really should.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** Do you need rest?

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** I'm full.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:12]** Sorry, I'm getting a little emotional about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:12]** Go ahead.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** Getting a little emotional.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:15]** You said you were not.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:18]** So I didn't know that people... I heard the opposite before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** No, I was fine.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:24]** I was saying I didn't want to be up for like... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:26]** What are you saying in character?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:33]** I was saying before we get into the Terrapin that we should rest.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:37]** so that we're not fatigued because this is a 500 mile journey.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:41]** That was when I was saying we should rest.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** Here's.

**[00:56:44 - 00:57:07]** not sorry my audio went out for a second could you please repeat that doctor i had a little uh i was saying that before we get into the same car yeah yeah i'm deaf right now i know turn down the music uh the f0 soundtrack listen i was saying before we get into terrapin

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:17]** That we should rest so that we're not up for like 18 hours without, you know, not knowing what we're about to get into.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:26]** But here we have this dome that is but a jaunt out of the way.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:50]** that we should maybe see and perhaps we could rest there or well i mean we're fine roughly uh well our yeah i don't know what what rick and colin okay and uh colin are up to but maybe maybe they could use a rest i don't know i'm fine i'm a i'm hurting pretty bad

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:52]** Oh, well, then let's rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:55]** There's no strategic disadvantage to resting.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** Not if you ask Sun Tzu.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:04]** Unless something comes up in the windows, but I feel like it would be more likely something would happen to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:08]** You only delayed the advantage of your enemy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:13]** I am down a calculated amount of 30 hit points and could use some healing.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:15]** However, I was able to rest and have full stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:43]** right okay well we can i got the med kit now take a full rest wait when did we get when did we get stamina back i took a short rest if you wanted to take a 10 minute rest last last episode yeah you were driving i'm if you need to take yeah that's true you were you were driving yeah i'm at i'm at 8 of 48 stamina and 19 of 40 hit points so like you're not gonna regain all your points unless you use a med kit or healing right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** Yeah, I mean, I can use the mid.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** Even a full rest.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** But you wouldn't be able to take a short rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:50]** Because I drove the rest of the way from after the river.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:53]** So you should be able to take a short rest between that time.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:55]** So everybody should have been able to take a short rest.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:58]** Like, okay, we should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:00]** But I get it.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:02]** But the full rest is free.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:04]** We don't know when we're going to have one again.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:06]** Let's just take the full rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:13]** So the full rest is, quote unquote, free, but it takes eight hours and we need to make sure we have who cares, like a secure place to do it.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** That way we're not ambushed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:22]** But okay, but you think, yeah, but like, we're out here in the middle of nowhere versus going to a location where there could be Reptoids.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:24]** Where is more secure, the Reptoid place or here?

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** You know what I mean?

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:38]** I don't see how, in the balance of, I hope John doesn't like just throw something to like make me regret this, but like, I don't see, it seems more likely that this would be the safe place to rest.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:41]** Every time I've ever wanted to take a long rest, people are like, no, we shouldn't.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** And then we always regret it.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:45]** I feel like we really should be doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:49]** I suggest that we... Well, sometimes you listen.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:53]** I suggest that we go to this dome and investigate.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:56]** I have enough health to get us through that combat, if necessary.

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:59]** And from there, we can take a long rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:03]** I mean, if we're going to... Okay.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** All right.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:05]** Sure.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** It's up to a vote.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** I can't make you guys do whatever.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:14]** So if you all vote that you don't want to get rest and restore your hit points and stamina points, then I'm not going to make you.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:17]** And of course I can't, I can't do that.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:20]** So I vote that we long rest here, but yeah,

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:21]** I'll leave it up to you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:27]** I say we rest at the dome after we figure out what's going on in this here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:34]** This is either much ado about nothing or going to be a really, really, really big tactical blunder.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:37]** But, you know, we're all here to tell the story.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** So let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:43]** I like that, Colin, because Colin, you... It doesn't affect me that much.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** I'm okay.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:51]** Colin, you weren't there when the three of them were down somebody and didn't long rest.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:57]** Remember, the three of you pushed to get to Colin without even resting, I think, right?

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:01]** Or you took one long rest, I think, like right after Nico passed him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:06]** With the Greybounder, we took a rest and complete panic because that Greybounder could just come through the wall at us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:28]** right yeah but we we had reasonable assurances at the time that it would be a safe thing to do i remember like at that time i was pleading with everyone to take a long rest and it's a good thing we did because if we didn't we would have died we wouldn't have been able to survive the next fight like i can't imagine we would have been able to but i'm not gonna like

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:32]** Yeah, I'm not going to try to die on hills today.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:35]** If you guys really don't want to do it, then I'm not going to.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:39]** I'm going to be... I'm fine on HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:46]** This is completely meta, but I don't expect anything at this dome to be... I personally don't think anything's going to happen at this dome.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:50]** We're going to get there and discover something, but I don't think we're going to have to fight anything.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** That's just me.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:53]** So I think we'd be able to take a long rest after we get to this dome.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:56]** I'm just going to note this in the notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:57 - 01:02:01]** If I'm going to take notes about anything Rick said, we won't.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:05]** That was Kevin saying that, not Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:09]** So let it be written, so let it be done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:12]** He just leans back in his chair and puts his arms behind his head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** Puts his headphones back on.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:15]** Okay.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:18]** Pulls his hoodie up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:19]** Draws the strings tight.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** Draws the strings.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:22]** It's real tight.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:27]** There's only one antenna sticking out because he's still missing the other one.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:27]** Alright.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:29]** Oh my god.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:32]** You all take the exit.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:33]** Get off.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:36]** The exit off the rock.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:54]** black dome exit 50 million fox suspicious tapping device like yes yeah 15 miles so funny the landscape

**[01:02:56 - 01:03:06]** With the setting of the sun now really reaching the horizon, the landscape gets pretty starkly colored.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:13]** I'd say between areas where the sun touches and everywhere that the light doesn't touch.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:23]** It's starting to get a clear gold as the rays are starting to scatter more than a cold blue gray where there's shadow.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:41]** You start to notice that every once in a while, the bright orange and yellow of the lava, especially as you're getting closer to this dome, you know, that feeling of when you're driving down the dirt road, you're about to get to the house.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:53]** But the sound of the tires underneath the gravel and the dirt road is that feeling of like where, you know, people start to wake up, start to feel kind of the tension in the air.

**[01:03:55 - 01:04:02]** You notice that some of the puddles, you're about 100 feet away now, some of the puddles are a little more, could it be the light?

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:11]** They look more gold, like liquid gold, and have these colors in them that remind you of oil, like where there's an oil spill.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:17]** And as you pull up, they bring you to the map.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:25]** You see before you, I need to adjust the health on your vehicles.

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:29]** You see that there's a dome.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:33]** It's maybe about 20, 30 feet wide at its widest.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:48]** And you see behind it a bunch of destroyed and piles of technological junk kind of off to the side on this downward slope of a minor crater.

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:57]** And there's that bubbling yellow mud oil all around.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:00]** It's quiet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:04]** What do you do?

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:06]** Rick raises his artillery laser and takes lead.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:07]** And fires.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:13]** I swear to God.

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:16]** Just shoots the...

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:18]** Bubbling oil.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:21]** What is this structure to the right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** What's up?

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:25]** I have such PTSD about this.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:26]** What's up?

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:30]** Like, as we're, I see a structure with like a radar dish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:33]** Yeah, there's a bunch of just junk there.

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:38]** That's like, it's like disassembled, casually tossed aside, thrown.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:39]** Got it.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:43]** Yeah, it looks like it used to be in use, but it's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:48]** So I'm going to get about 20 feet away and then I'm going to do a perception check.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:49]** It looks like there's a door.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:51]** There's one door.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:55]** So perception, I think it's a plus nine for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:58]** The door feels as cold as the landscape.

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:03]** 21 behind, you know, 21 on perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:04]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:06]** Colin, here's your walking up there.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:09]** There's a slight rise coming up to meet it.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:14]** You can see there's a path of ease where footprints and vehicles have kind of come up.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:15]** How old are these footprints?

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:17]** Why did we park so far away?

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:21]** I just put your vehicles there, but if you want to move them, you can move them.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:23]** It's fine.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:23]** Okay.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:24]** Yeah.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:25]** Do you want to do a survival check, Dr. Okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:33]** Well, I kind of want to see how worn some of these footprints are.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:41]** I would caution against moving the vehicles directly next to the building just because if there's somebody in it, they're going to see them.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:44]** Maybe we lose the element of surprise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:47]** Drive over the tracks that you're trying to investigate.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:53]** The repulsor just blows it away.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:55]** What's your survival check, Dr. Okay?

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:57]** And does anybody want to aid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:57 - 01:07:00]** I got a natural one.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:02]** Somebody else want to roll?

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:05]** Right as you go to look at it, there's just a survival.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:06]** Yeah.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:11]** Colin runs over the footprint that I'm looking at.

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:12]** Colin.

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:15]** I'm like, well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01
