**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** It's been a while since I've been to...

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** I forget what it's called.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:46]** You mean the store that pops up for 30 days a year and then moves to another location?

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:46]** Spirit Halloween.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:51]** I feel like there's two different stores you could get that costume from and they have very different vibes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** Very different vibes.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:56]** I've got a funny story about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:59]** Spencer's definitely has stuff like that.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:02]** In fact, I was at Spencer's with my ex ages ago.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** and it was around Halloween time.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:16]** They had all the costumes out, and my ex looked at one of those sexy insert profession here costumes, and she's like, I wish I looked like that in that outfit.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:19]** And I said, I do too.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:31]** And there was this group of three teenagers a couple feet away, and all of them, their heads snapped over towards me just to watch me get smacked, which didn't happen.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** The girlfriend shrugged.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:37]** And one of the guys was like, dude, that's effed up.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** Dude, that's messed up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** I thought they were going to burn her.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** I'd be like, oh.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:46]** I mean, when a girl just shrugs at what you say, that's not a good thing.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:48]** It would have been better if she slapped you.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:54]** But yeah, thank you for that.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:59]** Yeah, thank you for sharing that We do have so you bought it for yourself.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:18]** Sorry, I took all the banter time with my story.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** Yeah, I appreciate that.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** It's been like two minutes.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** Okay, so I got here.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** I got a banter and a write-in.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** Cool.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:31]** Here we go.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** I'll roll to see who gets it.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** But the banter topic is this.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:45]** Tell us something about your 3FC character that we have not yet learned about on the pod.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:51]** I have to tell you all something interesting about one of my favorite NPCs that I've run.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:55]** So who wants to go first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** Do Rudy.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** Do Rudy.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:00]** I want to know more stuff about him.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** I will think about it.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** Who has an interesting unknown thing?

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** about, uh, that's not the music I wanted.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** This is the music I wanted.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** Uh, who has an interesting thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** Uh, I'll go first, I guess.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:18]** Um, I, I, it might elucidate a point that was kind of touched on when we left the asteroid.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** Um, um,

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:34]** So Colin received a message to his data pad when we when the asteroid blew up and it was something to the effect of she's alive or she lives or something like that.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:40]** And Colin had a sister growing up

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:45]** And he's naturally adept at the medical sciences.

**[00:06:46 - 00:07:04]** And so as he was developing his mystic powers and kind of finding the boundaries and figuring it out, he somehow inadvertently struck his sister with a malady, an illness that no one could resolve.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:09]** And her death was the precipitating factor for him pursuing a life of medicine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:14]** And so, like, I'm putting Colin killed his sister in the news.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** I'm not going to.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:15]** That's what he learned.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** That's what you learned today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:17]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:21]** Having a weaponizing incompetence to make us write notes.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:23]** And I'm not buying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** So that's new information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** Yeah, that's a huge thing.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** That's like big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** Yeah.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:31]** Yeah.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:32]** That's a big one.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:33]** That's a big one.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:34]** It's a very big one.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:37]** That's a burden that you live with every day, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:40]** So now he tries to help people not die like his sister did.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:41]** Hmm.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** That's hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** And you got a message from somebody that said she's alive still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:47]** Right.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** Meaning his whole life is a lie.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** So that's fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** Yeah.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** That's the third fold.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** That's it.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** That's the third fold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** So?

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** Can someone else go?

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** I got to check my hero's notes.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Anyone else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:02]** Oh, I'll go.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** Okay.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** Um...

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:18]** Contu was initially in his schooling going to study computers and mechanics until he met Dr. A.M.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:18]** Boustakis.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:26]** He had to do a biology class, like a biology 101, biohacking 101.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:33]** And he ended up, after that long semester, changing his major.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** That's what led you down the quest.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:55]** And I have an entire log from Toil Day Rova 12, 299 AG, all the way to Fire Day Neth 17, 2999 AG, chronicling that change for contour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:58]** So proud of you for using those dates properly.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** That's cool.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:02]** That is cool.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:03]** That's, that's cool.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** I got to say the date thing was pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:12]** This is the backstory stuff that I, that I love both the, both the big stuff and the, and the small things that come in to make a difference.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** Cause maybe that will.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:16]** Thanks for sharing that.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:17]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:45]** here's rick uh i think honestly like the the listeners have heard most of the things about rick's past just not all at once and might be a little difficult to like piece it all together but i think the the thing that you guys don't really know about rick though complete completely new is that he actually enjoys pickleball on the weekends he enjoys pickleball

**[00:09:46 - 00:10:01]** but in in starfinder pickleball is a ball shaped like a pickle so it doesn't really bounce that well that's the thing it's terrible it's a terrible game it's a challenging game it's more like badminton it's with an emphasis on the bad yeah yeah it's just


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:23]** yeah it doesn't float like the shuttlecock it just like just just flips like a pickle yeah it's a flipping pickle all right it's a flipping pickle rick is just trying to make himself seem normal and like not about killing stuff so he just comes up with stuff like that and i think that's that's fine he's never gone hunting situation before

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:50]** oh i don't think that's true he's literally a bounty hunter okay well that's different what's that like show where it's just like where it's like hannibal or something like that and they're like eating a quote rabbit or whatever they're like oh it's a shame he didn't hop away fast not fast enough or something like that i don't know what that is i don't know what crazy tv you're watching bud yeah man


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** I don't know what Vietnamese TV you're watching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** It's just like a Japanese game show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** That sounds like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:00]** With that one dude who always plays... It's a North Korean game show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** Dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:08]** That is not popping up on anything on a Google search.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:12]** I'll add it later in the Discord or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:15]** I need... Yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** Yeah, do it, do it.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:17]** Oh, there it is.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** We miss you, man.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** California's gold.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:20]** We do.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:22]** You were California's gold.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:22]** Yeah.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:27]** All right, so, like, I've been trying to avoid saying stuff, but... You don't have to.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:31]** I can't say too much about here's right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** It's dark in there!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** Except, um...

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:51]** This is maybe cheating, but like, because it's not exactly about him, but I will say that you might have expected Rolu to inherit his responsibilities, like to sort of fill the vacuum that he has left when he left the Free Captains.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:57]** But it was actually Shira Dawnbreaker who did that being the first mate and

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:02]** I guess I'll just say that in the future, you'll see like a little bit of a preview of what that turns out to be.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** That's all.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:10]** I'm just teasing a little bit of a future thing that I think she's his spiritual successor.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:15]** And not because Rolu is like cryptic as ****, which he is.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:16]** And I still don't.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** This is another thing.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:21]** I don't know anything about Rolu compared to like what it almost annoys me.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** Like, you know, I have no control over him anymore.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:31]** So it annoys me because I don't, I don't know what to expect.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** I know it's going to be crazy.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:33]** That's all I'll say.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:37]** I really like Sharon though, as a person.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:39]** I'm sure more to come with her, but yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:46]** Who was the, the Disney character that you were like, this is roughly her persona.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:47]** Yeah.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:51]** Captain Amelia from treasure planet was what I was thinking.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:53]** Like kind of like a strong female, like captain.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:54]** ish character.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** I always thought she was a cool character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** I haven't seen Treasure Planet.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** Is that a good one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** Oh, dude, it's great.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** It's classic.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** It's pretty decent.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:08]** It's been a while since I've seen it.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:08]** It's great.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** It's pretty decent.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:10]** I don't know.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** I haven't seen it since I was like 12, okay?

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:16]** I just remember looking at Captain Moon and being like, this is pretty cool.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** All right.

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** I'll give it a shot.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:19]** I like it.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:22]** I'm going to be, I added something to my things to mention.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** I'm just real quick.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** If I could be selfish.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:29]** Cause like, yeah, I'm going to bring this up because people in the discord keep talking about it.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:33]** So I want to explain myself for people that inevitably again, are going to be like, Hey Kelly,

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:40]** be like, you know, I know you have that like cash thing, the cash capacitor, but it doesn't allow you to like load magic missile.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** And like, what was the other one that you can do?

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:46]** You can do a lot of cool spells, like supercharged weapon, like so that you could just use them as zero level spells.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:47]** I can.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:48]** Okay.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:48]** People.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:50]** And it's called devastators cash.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:50]** All right.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:53]** So I wrote this into my notes to bring up, look up devastators cash.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** It's something on top of cash hacks.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** That's where I can do that.

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:01]** So in case you're going to mention in the discord, I'm telling you right now, future people.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:02]** All right.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** That's what I'm doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** That's it.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** That's my comment.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** Finder just smiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** Yeah, he just smiles and laughs.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:12]** And that's from the character operations manual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:20]** I'm just jealous that Kelly was able to do that at level whatever you guys are, because I had to wait until level 11 to...

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:45]** basically quit playing my technomancer because it's a garbage class apparently they fix it with that as well these add-on books huh yeah like that let me share something this makes a big difference yeah kelly let's do it is it rudy no i'm done that's two actually there's there's there's two that i that i liked uh wait wait wait wait wait


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** You were right.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:49]** It was from the Hannibal TV series.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:52]** And the quote is, he should have hopped faster.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:52]** I butchered the line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** He should have hopped faster.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:54]** Yes.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** And then you're like, yes, he should have.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:58]** In his very cool accent.

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** Yeah.

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** That's you.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:00]** You're that guy.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:01]** That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:03]** He's not Hannibal.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:03]** Rick is.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** Rick is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** Rick is Hannibal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** Is it still Anthony Hopkins or is it a different actor?

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** No.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** No.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:13]** It's the two who played the villain in the first new Bond movie.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:14]** Oh, what was Mads Mikkelsen?

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:17]** The first of... Yes, Mads Mikkelsen, who's in Death Stranding.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:19]** It's the guy that I'm finally playing that game.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:23]** Don't talk about Death Stranding, I still want to play that, but he's in Skyfall?

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Whatever the f***ing first movie was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:27]** No, Skyfall was Benicio del Toro, I thought.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:28]** He's the villain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:29]** It's Casino Royale.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** Casino Royale.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:30]** He's the bad guy.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** Casino Royale.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:32]** Spoiler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:33]** God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:37]** To name the cast of a movie is a spoiler.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:39]** Yeah, when they play poker, that's the spoiler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:41]** But say he's a bad guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:44]** Kevin was still in the submarine during that time.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** He's got a big scar.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** It's super f***ing cool.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** So two things.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** So good in Rogue One.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** Yeah.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:57]** One of the things is, um, I think that you already know, but that I already mentioned, but I think about it occasionally.

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:01]** Cause I just think it's such a cool idea that Paizo came up with is Rudy.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** Uh, so I have, I have one about two different characters.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** The first one was Rudy.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:16]** You already know it, but he worked on the last call, which I still think is just such a neat idea that of course, for those who like don't find closure or peace, um,

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:21]** because they or their loved ones or their friends like die in space.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:30]** There's a ship, like a huge ship that's dedicated to finding closure and also possibly to finding retribution and mercenaries.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:43]** And so part of the backstory that I had that I think I mentioned, but maybe I didn't go too far into is that Rudy got his start doing some mercenary work, seeking retribution against those who had wronged

**[00:16:43 - 00:17:11]** uh and so he got retribution on their friends on like for the living against the dead and as part of that he did some mercenary work against the corpse fleet and other like unliving threats so he's oh he's so cool he has seen a lot yeah he is he has seen a lot and that ship is just such like a cool area to like come up with ideas for things happening so that was one that was one neat thing the other one that i liked is that um

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:19]** Ezra, the non-binary, the non-binary, non-binary Kasathan on, uh, the Voigra, right?

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:20]** Who's the pilot.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:38]** They are a pilot because they trained with the descendants of the original pilots, like the, like the lineage of pilots who defended the Adari as it was making its trek, right?

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:41]** That is his lineage of learning of like...

**[00:17:41 - 00:18:11]** uh his that's cool pedagogy and so what i didn't real like i i can't remember if this is real or not but the edarin void runner is a really well-known ship in starfinder terms it's like it's incredibly fast incredibly maneuverable like very like daredevil-ish very quick getting in and out and so my thought is that like i i swear it was a paizo thing but it might not be but i think it is is that those original pilots were called void runners

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:13]** And so Ezra is a Voidrunner.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:16]** Or, well, if he's still alive, he is a Voidrunner.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:17]** If he's not, then he was a Voidrunner.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** That's cool, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** Yeah.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** I love that fact.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** Yeah.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** I hope they lived.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** I hope that that explosion was fake.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** I hope it's like a trick.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** I hope something else exploded.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** Like the other ship.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:31]** Even though that ship... I can't remember if it flew away or not.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** But like...

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:34]** And we saw it flying to Turf.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** Especially for Colin and his girlfriend.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:38]** You pinged that ship flying away.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:40]** Yeah.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:43]** But I just hope it's full of them somehow instead of the Reptoids.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** That's what I want.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:47]** And Silverton's allowed to come along too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:50]** Though John's going to once again tell us that they're not actually Reptoids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:57]** I don't know what you're saying because I'm grabbing a D4 because there's a write-in sentence that we need to go through.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:01]** Oh, okay.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:01]** Cool.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:04]** And I'm going to message.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** What'd you write this time, Finder?

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Just tell us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:11]** A person on... I'm very bad at the... I got it.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** It's me.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** Well, no, it's me, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:19]** I'm going to message that person on Discord.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:21]** Right...

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:51]** pause for edit hang on let me let me log into AOL instant messenger so I can yeah right okay that person has been messaged good luck bringing that into this episode cool that was a good banter I like that banter that was fun I think you're a good banter John thanks I like learning about what y'all are what these things are

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:55]** That y'all are sharing.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:56]** Some I know.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** Most I know.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:00]** Some I don't.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:04]** Last time.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:06]** In episode 135.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** There was the threat.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Of a dragon.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:12]** Unclear.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** Was it here at the door trying to come in?

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** Was it just at the door?

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Moving around?

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** What is it trying to do?

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:19]** In...

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:43]** At that time, the vibrations of the dragon of what was happening caused a massive rock and gem to fall from the ceiling, crushing the front half almost of one of the Azers homes, Steven Pyralite.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:48]** And they lost their leg.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** Colin and Dr.

**[00:20:52 - 00:21:10]** O.K., you find out pretty quickly that the crystal that caused the damage somewhat partially helps to restore or heal or at least stabilize locally the wound.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:14]** Exhibiting some properties that you haven't seen before.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:30]** while you're finding that out, here's and Rick, you speak with Mirko and find out that when they first came here, they found an egg in a nest and not wanting to upset the natural order of the ecosystem around them.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:35]** Just put the egg outside and not wanting to upset the natural order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:37]** They moved everything out of its place.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:38]** Yes.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:42]** This is the leader of this group of people that decided to do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:44]** That is amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:44]** Yeah.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:55]** And as a result, knowing that there are potentially dragons in the area, thinks that this was probably a dragon egg.

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:05]** And their thought is that this is the parent dragon trying to get back in because they did seal up another entrance into this mine, into Corenda.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:09]** Flashback to Colin, Dr. O'Kay.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:14]** Dr. O'Kay, your quick thinking says, I could use this gem.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** and reattach the limb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** Pulls out a razor blade, starts chopping it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** Yeah.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:43]** You two, you two doctors, working with Dr. Searstone and bringing in orderly Rick19 and super sexy nurse Hears, go to work on reattaching the leg after stabilizing Stephen, making sure that he's okay.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:51]** You are able to successfully reattach their leg

**[00:22:51 - 00:23:15]** in a like nearly abandoned mine using field operations that's how good we are pretty impressive pretty cool i i i have to say i did not uh i did not have that as as what i thought might happen i don't try to guess but that was cool that was that was super cool what was supposed to happen

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:17]** There is no supposed to happen.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:20]** I just didn't know what was going to happen with that.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** So I just thought that was so neat.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** I just thought that was really cool.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** Well done.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** What do you all do in that moment?

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:30]** Let's go back to the map.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** You all I think are still on the map.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:33]** I'm going to unpause the map.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:36]** What do you all do in that moment?

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:45]** As you realize that Steven's vitals have stabilized and Dr. Sierra Stone is grateful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** Do they have a printer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** Do they have a printer?

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** Yeah.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:55]** I need to email a document.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:59]** I want to print out some post-op instructions for Steven.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:06]** As well as maybe make some of these chewables.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:10]** was a crystal for him and also for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:10]** Yeah.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:11]** Yeah.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:13]** You, you start to get to work on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:23]** Um, I grabbed some agar gum and, um, yeah, some, some water and this crystal mash.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:27]** And then I, then I had some flavoring, you know, like maybe a hot cinnamon flavor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** Yeah, totally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:33]** Um, and then I make basically a big red chewable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:52]** so you i don't know if you're doing that in the tent but you probably go back to your spot yeah yeah i print out the post-op instructions for him yeah um you know light work but make sure to exercise the leg

**[00:24:52 - 00:25:18]** make sure to flex it right yeah yeah but don't put a lot don't bear a lot of weight no lifting of any heavy objects um for at least like three months instructions yeah be sure to check in in a month with your doctor's primary care physician dr searstone uh she actually looks and uh yeah how much shorter is his right leg than his left leg now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** No, we said it.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:21]** They're set.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:22]** They're good.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** They're good.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:23]** Yeah.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** They're still out.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:26]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:51]** Dr. Searstone nods at you as you leave, and maybe you're still there, Dr. Edenbrand, and she says, I helped a little.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:51]** You did.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** You did, actually.

**[00:25:52 - 00:26:00]** I remember that when they said, stop the bleeding, you took the butt of the gun and you pushed it against the flesh to hold down.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** Yeah, that was very smart of you.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:02]** That was smart.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:03]** That was good.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:09]** But she was talking to you, Colin, saying like, how did you two know to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:14]** It was a lucky observation, I guess.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:21]** I saw the crystals had started to close the flesh, and I pointed it out to the good doctor over here.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:28]** Thankfully, he had the facilities to analyze it, and we could take quick action together to save this poor man's leg.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** There is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:32]** That was very impressive.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** I'm going to do a write-up on it.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:39]** I hope that I have to find a way to get it to the two of you, so you can review it.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** That was impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:44]** Aye, I think Dr. OK is already working on the white paper.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** He probably is.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** He probably is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:47]** Brilliant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** The two of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:51]** Well, I'll make sure that he stays all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** Icon 2?

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** Is it all right if I call you that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:57]** Yeah, yeah, it's... On the comms.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** I make sure I got my notes from it.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:04]** I'm going to take some more samples of this crystal, obviously.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** Also for post-op care.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:09]** And yeah, all in a day's work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:16]** The fact that the two of you keep such a cool head and seem to stay calm even afterwards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:21]** I mean, you know, he wasn't any worse off than before the thing fell on him.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:26]** So, you know, if it had failed, also would have done the write-up.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:32]** But it just wouldn't have had such a chosen outcome, I suppose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:33]** Right.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:35]** No, I think that he'll be...

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:45]** Whenever he wakes up, he'll be very happy to know that he can continue to get around his shop and do everything exactly like he's been planning on doing.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** So, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:48]** Thank you kindly.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:53]** Compared to the things that we've seen over the last... It's not like we 3D printed a windpipe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:53 - 00:28:23]** although I feel like in this universe we probably could fairly easily you probably could that I have done she says I actually have done that if anyone's interested I think I can handle some of the aftercare to make sure that he's alright and that he stabilized well he's good so but I have to say I don't think that he'd be alive without the two of you so I think yeah

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** You're welcome.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:28]** And the four of you.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** You're always welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** So...

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** what do you want to do now?

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:39]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:42]** You're going to work on the crystal tablets.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** Steven is okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:53]** I'm going to send Bernice back to start reintegrating with that, uh, cylindrical lens, uh, pistol with the transmutation matrix.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:53]** Okay.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:59]** Um, and I'm going to get gather some more ample supply of sample from this giant crystal.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:00]** Yep.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:05]** And then head back to my, uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:07]** Quarters.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:08]** Quarters.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** Start working.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:11]** Okay.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:11]** So I'm going to move.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** Collect.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** Colin, what about you?

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** He's going to go back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:22]** I think after the surgery, you see Colin take the deepest breath he's taken all day.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** Yeah.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:30]** Knowing that the clear and present danger is past.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:35]** And he turns his curiosity to the dragon nest that they've like

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** effectively robbed.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:49]** Um, and so I think what he would do is he would seek out, um, Mirko to get more information on like where they found this egg.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:52]** Uh, so he kind of likes her.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:54 - 00:30:18]** well I guess here it doesn't want to be alone with these flaming head people so they're very nice you can just talk to them um they're cool and everything but she points out a location that was like closer to the entrance closer to the edge there's not an exact area it's been mostly moved over um but

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:46]** there's she walks over there and says this is where the egg was but ever since then uh i have it's mostly stuff has fallen away or been cleared away so there's not really much here gotcha just like looking at the area does it look like a a nest of something like it with elevated natural occurrences and like some sort of shelter ish thing or does it just look like flat rock

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** No, it's mostly just flat rock.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:53]** Maybe this whole area was used as sort of a layer, you think?

**[00:30:53 - 00:31:00]** It wasn't necessarily that this area in particular was a nest, like this diameter of 20 feet or so was a nest.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:04]** It seemed like this was just all part of a safe space that was used, you would think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:08]** Rick rolled a 13 for life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:11]** Never gonna give you up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:36]** you again it seems like you think this whole mine was a layer so it's not like this one area was a nest like it's a nest in a tree and you're trying to isolate the nest it's like this whole area was a safe space right um so uh mirko how long has it been since you've put that egg out there well i don't know uh probably


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:37 - 00:32:01]** closer to a year i'd have to say it's been quite some time since then um can i make a life science check to see what colin knows about the gestation period of dragon sure uh dirty 20. dirty 20 you think that if


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** Mirko was able to move the egg.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:05]** Yeah, Grunt?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** Does a year pass the smell test?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:10]** Yeah, I mean, it makes sense that, like...

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:36]** on the order of the better part of a year you think yeah like sure like that something happened uh like the the egg is must not have been that far along if she was able to i mean she's pretty strong and big but like you know to to move the dragon egg up and outside and everything safely uh then do you think that that that that makes sense


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:43]** So we've taken the egg, we've pushed it outside, and it's still trying to get back in.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:46]** Have we considered maybe letting it back in?

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:54]** Since we've, you know, more or less stolen its home and kind of set up our own residence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:57]** Oi, that's a good question.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:02]** See, the thing is, they're red dragons, so they are rather evil.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:31]** in general they're rather not friendly and I don't know that that would be the safest thing to have them come back in define can we check on that it feels like they might be a bit hostile having had their homes stolen and shite but I don't know anyway sorry I'm just rambling over here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:39]** I think Rick generally asks, it's not like trying to be, but he looks at Colin and is like, should we try to talk to the dragons?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** I'm not opposed to it.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:45]** I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:50]** I mean, can I do a... Well, yours has never seen a dragon.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** I can guarantee that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** Do you want to do a life science on the dragon?

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** Yeah, I do.

**[00:33:56 - 00:34:00]** About trying to know whether you could coexist in the same space with a red dragon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:02]** This feels like one of those check style wisdom checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:26]** yeah i feel like some wisdom some of the sometimes things are just just evil they just are like sometimes in in certain universes and i'm wondering if that is the case here life science not misunderstood not like a dick just pure evil yeah and i rolled a 16 only i can try to assist on that yes he's only my finger i assist okay colin colin roll a one on the die


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:44]** okay Colin hold on one Colin you don't know here's you are pretty confident from what you know here's the budding zoologist photographer safari right yeah

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:55]** You are pretty confident that Red Dragons are typically, I mean, again, I don't want to generalize on people, but in general, Red Dragons tend to be chaotic evil.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** That's their rough alignment.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:05]** So it doesn't seem like the case where you've kicked out a friend and you would be happy to have the friend come back in.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:12]** It's like they're very smart, but they would want the space to themselves, is what you would think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** You know what?

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:19]** On second thought, I think you did a good job getting the egg out of here now that I think about it, Mirko.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:24]** I mean, a red dragon is probably a dragon you don't want anywhere near you.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:26]** It was probably wise after all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** I'll be honest, I feel bad about it.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:32]** I feel bad about taking the space.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:40]** We did, we perhaps could have found another space, but this is what was safest to us at the moment.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** And we made that decision.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:47]** If that's something that we can rectify, then perhaps, perhaps we can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** No, I don't think we need to.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** It's a red dragon, Mirko.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:57]** I'm just letting you know from my experience and knowledge, it's probably not a good thing to even interact with them.

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:02]** Let's just, let's not coexist with them in any way whatsoever.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:05]** And Kevin and Colin.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** I mean, Rick and Colin.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:10]** Let's try not to talk with them.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** It is a red dragon after all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:15]** I think we should just keep moving forward.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** Shouldn't we hear him out?

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:21]** I mean, we've... I take back what I said earlier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** I think he's right.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** Dragons are not...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:48]** these dragons are probably not safe to talk to look if there's a solution out there I know what it's like to have to leave your home so to have done that to somebody else in the purpose with the intent of doing that for ourselves if there is a solution out there or if you find out more about the dragon please let us know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:52]** I mean, have you ever played Past Finder?

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:58]** You know, it's a TTRPG set in Ancient Galarian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:02]** I've heard tales of Galarian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:06]** The dragons in that game are pretty violent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:15]** Oh, so you're saying the dragons in Pathfinder are the ones that we should... Pathfinder, not Pathfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:18]** Those are two different... Yeah.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Pathfinder, right.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:24]** And red dragons in particular are really, really bad in Pathfinder.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** Right, right.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** Chaotically so.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:28]** Well, okay.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:32]** I mean, I'm sure if we find information, we'll relay it to you.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:39]** So, do you all want to explore the stuff with the dragon any further?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:44]** I do want to say thanks, Finder, for that line.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** Hey!

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** Wait, what was the line?

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:52]** The Galarian line is from Pathfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:58]** Pathfinder wrote a line about Pathfinder.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Yeah, great.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:03]** And it works that you're here on stream to hear it happen live.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:04]** Thank you.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** And actually, you worked that in really well, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:08]** That was nice.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** Thanks.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Yeah, it was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** So what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:22]** I'm conflicted here because I feel like the, the natural one on a wisdom check, like, I don't know how, how far down this rabbit hole does Colin want to pursue it?

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:28]** Because I feel like he genuinely feels like, because he knows nothing about red dragons, which I guess we've established at this point.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:36]** Like we've, we've basically taken over this dragon's home and it like,

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:44]** He kind of want to facilitate the dragon's return, but also gets the red flags that he hears and Rick are throwing up.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** And so I don't know.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:49]** I think Colin's a little conflicted on what to do next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:55]** I sense that you're conflicted, Colin, on what to do next.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** May I ask why?

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** May I probe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:00]** Sure.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:05]** It's just, it doesn't sit right with me.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:14]** You know, these creatures are seeking asylum on our plane and that's fine.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:27]** But to displace a creature that was in its own home to basically take its child and sit it out with the refuse doesn't sit right with me.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:36]** I mean, we've basically been kidnapped and placed in somewhere unnatural by these greys and we're trying to figure out what's happening.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:40]** It seems like something very similar is happening to this red dragon.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** Should we go help it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:44]** I understand.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:53]** Well, if you bring it back here, possibly it will fight and try to kill everyone.

**[00:39:55 - 00:40:01]** So between Dragon and these flaming head people, I feel like I'm more with them.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:04]** I mean, we just sewed a guy's leg back on.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:05]** He might die.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:24]** that might all be for naught i mean but if a dragon comes you know what i'm saying can can here's just like relay any legends of red dragons being dicks generally like if i roll something could i tell a tale spin a yarn for colin so you could have content i think if you can spin a yarn you don't need to give me a roll


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** Well, he's going to lie because he doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** He knows that they're evil, but he can't.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:31]** Well, if you're going to lie, then you need to roll a check.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:33]** It's like the dictionary told him.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** If you're going to lie, you need to roll a check.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:35]** Right, right, right.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** Well, okay.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:38]** Oh, he's confident.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:38]** Okay.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:44]** Personally, he knows from reading about them in encyclopedias and hearing stories, but he can't recall the story off the top of his head.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** So I guess he's going to have to lie.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** All right.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:48]** Bluff.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:49]** Wow.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** My bluff is a plus one.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** Yeah.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** So that's an 18 though.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** What do you say?

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:53]** Uh-huh.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:54]** But what do you say?

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** There's a guy I knew once.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** He was very similar to Rick.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:01]** He just liked to kill things and stuff like that.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:08]** And the reason why he was like this was because his family was eviscerated by a family of red dragons.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:15]** And his entire bloodline, like, like,

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** All their lives have fought Red Dragons.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:22]** Like, legend says that it goes all the way back to the times of Galarian.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:31]** You talk about Pathfinder, like, the world, the real world that we had once upon a time that that game is based off of.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:55]** like the story says the stories say that for that long they've been fighting red dragons because they just destroy villages and destroy people and so if they can create ricks imagine what else they could do so i i just so many legends and stories that are totally real and i'm not bluffing or lying

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** like, just shows that they're horrible.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:01]** I just want you to be really careful, Colin, and consider what you're doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:11]** Colin, if you want, you can give a sense motive if you think you need to roll against that, or if you think Colin would believe him.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** 15.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** I'll let you make that decision.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** You rolled a 15?

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** Oh, my God.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** I didn't hesitate at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:40]** So you Yeah You you rolled so poorly I mean like there's no fail but but just but just to like lean into it here's rolled pretty well and you were very very

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:51]** it feels to me like it's not fully settled, but for the moment it is like you, if, if I have a strong morality towards that, please go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:51]** Yeah.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:55]** Let me, I think I kind of want to unpack Collins, Collins feelings.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:59]** So like he knows the story itself is bull.


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:02]** Like he can tell that there was never a bloodline.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:05]** There was like, all of this is, is fiction, right?

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:17]** But it's fiction founded on fact and the very real danger of this red dragon as it exists to this society and all other societies in this plane.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:20]** So like it's a, it's a cautionary tale.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:23]** It's that, that here's presented as fact.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:29]** And so I think he, he perceives the like, okay, this is a fable and,

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:36]** but maybe he shouldn't be so cavalier about bringing this red dragon back to where he came from.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:39]** I think that's his perception of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:47]** I think he believes still that Colin completely bought his story and he can see that it's working.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** So he just smiles.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:55]** Takes off his nurse cap because he forgot to take it off earlier.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** Feels kind of satisfied with himself.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** He's doing good work today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** Okay.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** I understand.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:12]** I'll let the dragon thing go, and if it pulls up, I guess I'll help fight and heal and all those things, but it still doesn't sit right with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:19]** I understand where you're coming from, and there's plenty good that we're doing right now, and that we'll continue to do, Colin.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:22]** So, I know you're a good guy.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:24]** We'll have plenty of opportunities to do the right thing.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:25]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:46]** While all this is going on, Dr. O'Kayes grabs a sample, heads back to his hut with Bernice, and gets to writing on infernal blessings assessing the magical therapeutic properties of Varosian red crystals from Berthita's Hellscape Moon.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:53]** And he names it, since I feel like I get naming rights,

**[00:44:54 - 00:45:00]** Verosite Vitae Rubra, which translates to Red Life Verosite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** Red Life Verosite.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:03]** Yeah.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:04]** I like that.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:06]** V-A-R-O-C-I-T-E.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** Verosite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:08]** Yeah.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** It's from Veros, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:12]** I love this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Scientific paper published.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:21]** I want to see this abstract in the Discord.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** This is awesome.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:23]** Infernal blessings.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** I love it.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:28]** Okay, so you're starting to write.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:34]** It must feel nice, Dr. Okay, to be doing what you do.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** You have the space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** You're able to hold space.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:40]** It's a nice distraction from the things that are going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:41]** Yeah.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:46]** That had been going on for at least two weeks now, you know, since everything's happened.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** It's one of the first times that you've had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:54]** Does it feel a bit like home to like write in long form and in an academic genre?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** Yeah.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:55]** Be thinking this way.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** Yeah.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:56]** That's cool.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:57]** I love that.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:08]** You all are like starting to have more conversations and more and explore things that you haven't felt for a while or done in a while.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** And there's like space here to do that.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** What else do you want to do?

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:17]** Dr. O'Kay is classifying a new mineral, working on the paper.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:24]** You're exploring some moral questions about what it means to be a refugee and come to a new space.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:35]** here's our, uh, Rick, you're probably still grappling with the fact that you've now just met people from the AAF kind of for the first time.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:50]** And don't forget that they talked about not only giving you the number, uh, to reach out to when you made it to the, uh, the space on Rose light, but also they said that they can give tattoos to your.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** the rest of your party, if you want to?

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:56]** Is that something that you want to bring up to them or share with them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:56 - 00:47:06]** I mean, Rick would definitely share it with them and say, PD is actually one of the members of the AAF that apply these tattoos to us.

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:14]** He has offered to provide you each with a tattoo that will give us some kind of benefit.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:20]** I'm not certain of what it can be, but it's up to each of you of whether you receive it.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:24]** Are you talking to us or them?

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:30]** Yeah, he would say that to each of you, if he could get you all together, or he would say to each of you as individuals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:32]** Oh, well, can we choose our tattoo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:37]** Yeah, he, I mean, do you want to talk to him about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** You going to get a tramp stamp?

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** To Petey or Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** To Petey, Mr. Decker.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** Petey.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** All right, Petey.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:51]** You guys want to get a commemorative tattoo of our time on Heroes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:52]** A commemorative tattoo.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** A dragon, a red dragon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:58]** You would know that it's more than a commemorative tattoo.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** That he's able to do more than that.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:03]** You just don't know what it is unless you're going to go talk to him about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:08]** How exactly do you tattoo a slug or somebody with an exoskeleton?

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:11]** Yeah, I do have a carapace.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:13]** That is my next question, honestly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** But we'll get there.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** He's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** He solders it all.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** Good answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:20]** That wasn't headwave at all.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:21]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:24]** Do you guys want to get something?

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** I don't care.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:27]** I'll get one with you.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:30]** I think Cullen... It's our friend types.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:38]** I think Cullen would want like a bicep tattoo of like a gray alien face that says true believer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:42]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:44]** That works.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** That definitely does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** So you go talk to Petey.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:51]** He has given tattoos to many members of the AAF.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:54]** Some of them are androids, so he knows what he needs to do.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** It's fine.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:59]** I'm not really too worried about his ability to do it on different species.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:01]** That feels pretty obvious that he could do that.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:06]** He tells you that there are three different types of tattoos that you could do.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:09]** One, he can only do for AAF members.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:18]** So if any of you are going to join the AAF, then he couldn't give you the tattoo now, just like Rick, but that could be part of your initiation.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:22]** So that tattoo is a DR5 tattoo.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** That's part of the AAF.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:27]** That's like the next step for the tattoo that Rick already has.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:32]** He can't give it to Rick right now, but if you all want that, you would need to join the AAF.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:38]** He can also give you a tattoo fusion.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:43]** So what it is, it's a tattoo of a weapon.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:49]** It is the tattoo of a weapon.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:59]** And then what you can do is actually cause the weapon to appear.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:05]** And so you're able to use it in order to difficult choice so far.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** It's like a weapon fusion.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:11]** That's my understanding, unless finer, you know, it to be something different.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:21]** Um, and then the other thing is, is that you could also do what's called a false bond tattoo and you do that in pairs.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:30]** And so what that allows you to do is it forms a link between the two people with the tattoos.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:34]** And you can communicate with each other as if you had telepathy up to 100 feet.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:45]** There's another thing where you can each roll initiative checks separately and treat the higher result as the result for both of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:47 - 00:51:12]** there is a bit of a like we'll save thing but let me put these two things in our chat here wait so at any time you could be like i need a roll initiative roll like each of you like once a day each each time each of you rolls it once a day you could get the others if it's higher so once a day here's the false bond once a day linked creatures within 30 feet


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:35]** who have separate initiative roles can treat the higher result as the result for both of them when you use that it does overwhelm you so you both have to to uh succeed at a dc-14 we'll save or you're off target for a round and i just put it in our internal starfinder or he can be cool actually yeah they're both pretty cool um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:35 - 00:52:03]** and cool yep well i mean i don't i don't like to to me the last one doesn't seem worth it even though like from a gameplay perspective it's cool flavor i think i definitely prefer the weapon fusion one here's does want to ask if you can um can i can i if i get a tattoo could it glow like like like rick's tattoo and your tattoo is that a thing or is that just the aaf tattoos or


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:10]** it's just the AAF that can glow with that word and impression.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:16]** But if you would like it to glow in general, there might be another way where you can have that happen.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:27]** It might require a bit more, but, uh, a bit more work, but it could, could glow in general, but I, I can't have it tied to a word.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:31]** That's, that's part of the trait for the AAF tattoo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** I understand.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:33]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:52]** okay uh can i choose the color glow yeah you can choose whatever you want it will glow it will take an action for you to dispel the glow uh so you'll have to that's how i do that yeah keep in mind that if you're doing the tattoo fusion um

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:59]** you can basically hide or retrieve the weapon as a swift action.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:05]** Uh, so if you made it glow, then people would see that you have that unless you're trying to hide it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** Does that apply to any weapon?

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** Can you change the weapon after the fact?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:12]** I think it applies to any weapon.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:15]** And I, I don't think you can change it unless you change the tattoo.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** Um, that's my understanding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:21]** There's, there's not a lot about it now, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** You could choose the weapon now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Okay.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:24]** Yeah.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** All right.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** And so I can't just like turn off.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** I can't select the glow.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** It's going to glow every time I pull out my weapon.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:36]** I can't choose it to glow or not to glow, correct?

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:38]** Is that right?

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** When I activate it?

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:40]** Yeah.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:41]** Is there a setting?

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Can I change the brightness?


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:43]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:45]** Can I change the brightness?

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** No.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** You can make it glow if you want to.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** It's fine.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:54]** It's just it's not glowing in the same hidden way that it is for the AAF.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:59]** But the point of it is to... That's problematic from a tactical perspective is what you're saying.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:00]** Right.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** I agree.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:06]** Also, part of the tattoo fusion is to not indicate that you have one.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:11]** You can't detect that it's magical when it's in its tattoo form even with detect magic.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:17]** Um, something closer to those with a more skilled insight, like true seeing, uh, could do that.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:20]** Um, so part of it is to hide there.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:25]** We have typically used it before when we're trying to get weapons in the places where they should not be.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Is there a limit on what weapons I could choose?

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:31]** This would probably go into a weapon fusion role.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:34]** So I don't, I don't, I don't think so.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:35]** Finder.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** I don't think there's a limit on what you can do.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:43]** It's like I literally choose some crazy thing.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:45]** Well, but what you have with you right now.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** I mean, he's not going to take any weapon.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** Oh, it has to be what I have with me.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** He can't just come up and make any weapon.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** It's a weapon fusion.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** A lightsaber.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:54]** No, no, no, no, no, no.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** It's added to the weapon.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** You infuse the weapon with it.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:58]** Yeah.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** So he can't just make any weapon right now.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** Yeah.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:04]** Yeah.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** So you're thinking about that.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Colin, are you thinking about getting one?

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** Dr. K, are you thinking about getting one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:14]** I think Colin, Colin is thinking about getting one for the mechanical like advantages.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** Okay.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:19]** But it's one of those where the, the tattoo.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:31]** Like having him doing some research on what this tattoo actually does, like it doesn't like fuse the weapon to his body somehow.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:39]** It's a magical amendment to whatever ability, to whatever weapon he happens to be wielding at that point in time.

**[00:55:39 - 00:56:07]** and so what I think I'm wondering as a player and Colin is wondering as a player character is like what what are the common fusions that we can leverage here I don't follow your question I'm sorry so like the tattoo is effectively a weapon fusion but it's it's on your body instead of like a weapon fusion on that specific weapon

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:28]** right you would you yeah yes so i think what i'm trying to figure out is like what this does basically of the weapon right on your skin exactly that you can call out to be a physical weapon as a swift action you can hide it or retrieve the weapon


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:36]** And it says as a detect magic or a mysticism check will actually cause the weapon to fall off your skin and land on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:41]** Not detect magic, true seeing, which is a higher level spell than detect magic.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:43]** Sorry, detect magic does not reveal.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:46]** Detect magic and other similar spells don't reveal it.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:50]** But true seeing and a mysticism check shows that says that this is a magical tattoo.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:57]** And if you use dispel magic successfully, then you cause it to appear and fall at your feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:01]** Yeah, so you're hiding the weapon on your skin in the form of a tattoo.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** Okay, got it.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:03]** Got it.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** Got it.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:04]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:07]** Rick would would say would go with that one.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:12]** And he would get the his artillery laser tattooed across his bicep.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:32]** um does this weapon have to be so he asks like does this weapon have to be in our does it has to be on our person in order for us to do this or if i lose this weapon later i'm still bound to it with via the tattoo or if i give it to someone can i still use this weapon by the tattoo


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:58]** i think if you lose the weapon then it wouldn't like the fusion is getting it out of your body so if you like it's not like you can be a mile away and be like let me do it like i i don't that doesn't make sense like you need to have the weapon on it so if you want to hide it on your body you can yeah really convert another like level 12 i think so i think he is i think he's trying to find one uh-huh venom casters yeah okay yeah this is good radio um so

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:01]** Yeah.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:04]** So, Rick19, you're doing the weapon fusion of what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** My artillery laser.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Okay.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** Here, do you want to do one?

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** Yeah, I do.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:15]** Let me, uh, okay.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:19]** I don't mean to, I don't mean to belabor this, but like, could I do the Electrophore statue?

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:22]** That's not really, I don't know if that qualifies as a weapon.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** I'm guessing it doesn't.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** I'm just trying to stretch it.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Yeah, I mean.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:28]** Well, I don't think there's an advantage to doing it.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:32]** I'm just, I just think it'd be kind of cool to have Electrophore on my arm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** That's true.

**[00:58:34 - 00:59:02]** i guess you could i think technically it's not a weapon um but yeah that then all right here's what i'm gonna do but i would let you to if you were like yeah i really want to i mean it's it's fine deploy electrovore as a swift action i mean that's not terrible well it's definitely it doesn't activate the electrovore right you hide it so if you brought it out right so like right when you're drawing the weapon so like he he would have to with his electrical move action to pull it

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Right.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:07]** Versus a swift action to pull it and then you would still need to activate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** Yeah.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** I'm just messing around.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:10]** All right.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** All right, cool.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:16]** Then I'm going to use the, I'm going to put on the axiomatically centered long sword.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:23]** And when I, on this though, my request would be, I wanted to say for victory for the heart.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** Invisibly, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:27]** Well, it's not invisible.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:32]** The sword will be present, but the text will be there.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** If that's on the sword, then I'll make sure that it's there on the tattoo.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:37]** Sure, of course.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** Sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:39]** I have forearm, if you could please.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:43]** I just wanted it to come out like a flavor wine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:43]** Sure.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:46]** It's like a hidden blade that comes out.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** Got it.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** But it's on your forearm.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** Okay.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:50]** Very cool.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** I like that.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:53]** Colin, did you want to do one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:56 - 01:00:02]** I think Colin seeing the other two go for it.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:05]** I think he will pull the trigger on his survival knife.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:07]** Nice.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:08]** What do you want?

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:12]** Down his right bicep.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:14]** Okay.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** So cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** Of course.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** It's not a problem.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** This is a classic.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:22]** This will always help you when you need it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** Rick, where did you get yours?

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** I have knives.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:31]** Rick, where did you get yours?

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** I think across the bicep.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:34]** He cut it down his arm.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:36]** It's a big gun.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** It's a big gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** Rick holds his guns up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:56]** literally holding those guns up dr okay yes did you want to have either a weapon fusion i'm on the comms in a different area i'm sorry i didn't mean to distribute writing okay yeah what's up man


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:00]** Did you want to get a tattoo I had offered?

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:09]** We can do a weapon fusion or perhaps a false bond if you and one of your fellow travelers want to have a connection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:11]** Sounds like a neat thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:19]** I have given tattoos to species that don't have quite the same surface tension.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:22]** Can you just put it on a random tentacle?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:24]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:25]** Sure.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:27]** What did you want to get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:30]** A tactical syringe spear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:31]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:38]** I'll add it to your tentacle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** Sweet.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:50]** I just want to point out that, like, no one got the android abolitionist front tattoos because apparently this is so cool that we just don't give a **** about, like, being useful to them.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** So we're sorry, Rick.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** But, like, it was too cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:56]** I'm not an android, and I'm not going to abolish their front.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:56 - 01:02:19]** well you'd have to actually go through the initiation yeah you would i know you would have to join that now and no but you couldn't get it now rick can't even get that i know i understand i know i know i remember i'm just saying i'm just saying you like the weapons too much and i was just apologizing to rick well nobody's close enough with each other to to get the total i know that is interesting that is interesting


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:42]** also keep in mind that there are higher levels to the aaf tattoo so i'm just gonna let i mean rick we'll find out it's too late now it's fine but there are more than just the dr5 i know they go i read it they go like tell me if you're jealous man just let's stand no i mean i think you all did some cool choices here i love this that you all chose to go through with the tattoos


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:48]** Because secretly they're a curse and you're going to screw our character the next time we use our weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:49]** Ah, yes, indeed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:51]** He's actually a red dragon.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:53]** Classic me, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]** It summons a red dragon instantly that fights you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:59]** So that takes probably... Like Transformers, or not Transformers, like Power Rangers style.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:01]** Yeah, exactly.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:04]** Come out and then combine into be a red dragon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** Yeah.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:07]** That would be kind of dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:18]** So I think your time with PD checking in on Steven, seeing what's going on, Dr. O'Keefe, you're working with Bernice, you're writing this paper.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:22]** This has taken probably the rest of the day.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:25]** I mean, I think you're still at the end of the first day.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:29]** You arrived here earlier today and a lot has happened.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:30]** You found out a lot.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:33]** So it feels like you can...

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:35]** I mean, what do you want to do?

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:38]** Otherwise, I think you all have dinner with them.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:40]** You have the patches from your tattoos.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:43]** And what do you all want to do?

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:47]** Anything with this the rest of this first day?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:52]** I think this is great.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:55]** It is nice to finally get a chance to relax, but

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:58]** We need to move forward.

**[01:03:58 - 01:04:02]** We need to find a way off this planet and get back to our homes.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:05]** What is our plan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:09]** I think we could go to, well, I don't know, maybe Terrapin Station.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** I think that's what we had in mind.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:14]** So we could probably go there now.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** I mean, we did agree to go there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** And I'm very curious.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:29]** That's the only place that you all remember that, you know, you don't know if there's anybody left from Tercalus, uh, Seward or not.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:30]** They might be there.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:32]** And that's the only place that you know of a,

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:46]** starship so that's where you've been planning on going you look at your map you're not too far you could be there tomorrow if you if if you took the night to rest left in the morning you could be there tomorrow


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:51]** We could follow Kevin's logic and rest at Terrapin Station, though, as well.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:56]** But I agree that it would actually be good to sleep here.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** I think it's probably better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:57 - 01:05:00]** The facepalm from Finder is everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:01]** Legendary.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:02]** It's everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:03]** Amazing.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:04]** Amazing.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:05]** Thank you, Finder.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** We were all thinking it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:12]** I think we should sleep here.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:18]** I concur with that, but do we all agree that in the morning we will move on to Terrapin Station?

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:19]** That's fine.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:25]** Depending on some other emergency from whatever on high being there might be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:27]** I think I would need to publish my paper.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:34]** I assume we'll need to fight a dragon at some point, but that will be... We will cross and burn that bridge when we get there.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:35]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:40]** Okay.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:45]** So you all have a lovely meal with the rest of them.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:53]** I won't, I don't need to go too much into it, but it's, it's kind of a nice, easy dinner to close out the night.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:55]** Everyone is tired.

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:59]** Don't ever say that again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:01]** I don't want to even think about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:14]** whale polyps a lot of what they had earlier but there's some leftover that's been you know cooking in the oven that smells throw some crystal in that stew give some healing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:16]** You do work with Zyra.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:20]** Just drop it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:22]** You sprinkle it on top.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:23]** It tastes great.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:33]** And I think for the most part, people want to go to bed because it's been a long day with this threat, with what happened with Steven.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:36]** It's been a lot.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:39]** You all will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:39 - 01:07:06]** is bernice now uh attuned with the the transmutation matrix for the cylindrical lens pistol she is awesome we can get into i i sent you all the equipment from last time but we can get into um everything that you have here that i sent about the other inventory that you got from grom dahlia okay can you get a tattoo


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:09]** I don't know that Bernice can get a tattoo.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:14]** That feels... I guess you could have a weapon fusion and put it on Bernice.

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:16]** There's no reason why you couldn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:18]** Of the transmutation matrix.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:21]** Whatever that looks like.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:24]** Oh, that's a good question.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:24]** What would it look like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:26]** Get a up Bernice's street cred, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:36]** It's like the leather just gets like a little burn mark on the briefcase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:38]** It's embroidered or not embroidered.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:39]** It's bedazzled.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:39]** Stitched.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:41]** Stitched.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:42]** Oh my God.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:43]** It is bedazzled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:45]** Yes.

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:47]** Bedazzled with red crystals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:52]** Red crystal varisite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:56]** You all go to sleep.

**[01:07:58 - 01:08:01]** Anything interesting about your dreams or thoughts as you're falling asleep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:28]** maybe you're all tired i guess you just dream dreaming of rudy walking away into the distance again that was a memory of this i i feel like colin dreams of like when he sleeps his brain takes him back to um his humanitarian mission on i hoped if i would stutter for long enough the name of the planet would come to me akaton thank you um

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:36]** And when he wakes up, he startles awake thinking he's back on the asteroid.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:42]** And then startles awake again when he realizes he's on Pharos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:46 - 01:08:55]** I think Rick kind of has something similar where he's, as he falls asleep, we're still inside of this cave with lava and everything else and it's red and dark and

**[01:08:57 - 01:09:07]** He kind of gets this flashback of Cecil and that last fight that we witnessed during our nano adventure.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:17]** And he feels himself falling into whatever that portal thing was.

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:20]** But every time he falls into it,

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:27]** he just lands back in the same location and then falls again.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:36]** And it's, it just, it's kind of repeating, just, he's constantly falling and falling and falling and falling through this portal, uh, until he, he just wakes up in a sweat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:40]** Hmm.

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:41]** You're fatigued one level.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:42]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:44]** Cause you don't sleep well.

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:46]** No, uh, ref.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:48]** These are not easy dreams.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:49]** Well, except for the one about Rudy.

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:51]** But these are not easy dreams.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:52]** Yeah, that was a good dream.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:52]** What the f***?

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:53]** This sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:56 - 01:09:57]** You wake up the next morning.

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:58]** Stephen's up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:00]** Oh, yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:05]** Maybe as you're walking around getting some coffee and breakfast, he walks over.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:08]** He's got some crutches.

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:11]** And he says, Rick, I have something for you.

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:19]** And he had your, shoot, what's it called?

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:19]** Artillery laser?

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:20]** Yeah.

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:23]** He added a cicatite fusion to it.

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:25]** Is that in the tattoo?

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:26]** No.

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:27]** Oh.

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:30]** Well, yeah, I mean, it is in the tattoo if you did that.

**[01:10:31 - 01:10:31]** Yeah.

**[01:10:31 - 01:10:33]** He adds that in, but that was the thing.

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:35]** Um, I'll send it to you in the chat.

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:35]** Yes.

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:38]** But that's what he was working on.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:44]** Uh, when that everything happened, you all are getting ready to leave.

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:50]** We got more armor, didn't we?

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:53]** Didn't we, like, last two episodes ago get armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:53]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:54]** We can deal with it offline.

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:58]** I think... Okay, I think that I took it if I remember correctly.

**[01:10:58 - 01:10:59]** I think you did, too.

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:02]** Yeah, let's... I thought no one else needed it or something.

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:02]** Okay, cool.

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:03]** I'm just making sure.

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:04]** Yeah, of course.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:06]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:09]** Yeah, we can deal with what you guys got, but they were happy to help out with that.

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:12]** They are going...

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:15]** Starting to gather around.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:16]** I guess you all are getting ready to leave.

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:19]** Mirko walks up to you.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:24]** Everybody steps over, including Steven and Petey.

**[01:11:26 - 01:11:35]** Mirko walks up and says, if there's anything that you all need, just come back, let us know, and we'll do our absolute best to accommodate.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:42]** But we are very fortunate that you made your way over here and found your way down.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:44]** I think you've made a big impact here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:46]** Thank you for your hospitality.

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:48]** We appreciate the stay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:53]** Stephen, make sure to follow those post-op instructions we printed for you.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:57]** Oh, I definitely will.

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:59]** Check in with Mirko as needed.

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:03]** She's the doctor, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:03]** Lydia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:06]** Lydia Searstone.

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:09]** Check in with Lydia periodically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:11]** Oh, I absolutely will.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:12]** I definitely will.

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:15]** And next time you come back, I'll have something for you.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:16]** I promise.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:17]** I had some couple ideas in my head.

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:21]** As soon as I'm walking a little bit faster in just a few days, I'll get it right for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:23]** Don't go too fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:25]** No, of course.

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:26]** Of course, I won't.

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:28]** And then kind of stumbles a bit.

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:28]** Oh, it's fine.

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:28]** It's fine.

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:29]** It's fine.

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:31]** Falls over into the lava, dies instantly.

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:33]** Okay.

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:50]** PD comes up to Rick and says, Rick, please, whenever you make contact with the AAF on Rose Light, let me know.

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:52]** Will do.

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:54]** Thank you.

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:55]** Good.

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:55]** Of course.

**[01:12:56 - 01:13:04]** I'm happy to have met somebody else here and happy to be able to make a connection that doesn't happen that often.

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:12]** And it is important for such a disparate group as ourselves to make sure that we remind each other that we're not alone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:16]** Rick just kind of nods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:18]** All right.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:20]** And then Mirko's like looking at her watch.

**[01:13:20 - 01:13:24]** She's like, you guys going or what are you going to do?

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:25]** Jokes.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:26]** All right.

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:30]** She says, Lydia, if you could.

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:42]** And Lydia comes over and make sure that you all have the serums of healing that she probably didn't give to you at the time because you had talked about it.

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:47]** She gives you three Mark two serums of healing and three Mark one serums of healing.

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:57]** These should do just enough to get you on your way and make sure that if there's something that happens, that you'll be stable and well.

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:04]** And frankly, if you're in the care of Dr. O'Keefe and Dr. Ian Brent here, then you'll be quite all right.

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:08]** But this should get you far enough just in case you're incapacitated for the moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:09 - 01:14:15]** I'll be sure to send you a link onto my findings from this stone, but I encourage you to do the same.

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:17]** Make your own research.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:19]** We absolutely will.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:20]** Thank you.

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:21]** We absolutely will.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:28]** This Varasite is something really interesting here that we frankly didn't have a lot of time to get into since we've been here.

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:42]** So somehow this has been a bit of a blessing that it's fallen and that you were able to help out and keep everything ship shape and steady.

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:46]** Mirko says, and remember, if you find out anything about the dragon, let us know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:49]** I'm sure we will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:49 - 01:14:51]** I'm sure you will too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:53]** Sure, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:54]** All righty.

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:58]** And you all leave Corundum.

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:02]** Let's move back up.

**[01:15:03 - 01:15:18]** to the surface to rick and colin's busted car yeah right yeah right you are walking up

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:43]** clunk clunk clunk i move you guys back to the abandoned mine here and you're back at the surface the heat hits you like an absolute wave you feel like you it's not refreshing let's just say that let's get back in these hoopties let's get back in the hoopties okay

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:48]** Your plan to go to Terpin, is that right?

**[01:15:49 - 01:15:53]** Let me put you guys on the Varos map.

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:55]** Is there anything else you want to do here at the surface of the mine before we go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:57 - 01:16:04]** There's no like, you know, tracks or like different, the vehicles look like they're fine, right?

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:06]** Like they've been moved or touched.


## Speaker_0

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:07 - 01:16:07]** Right.

**[01:16:07 - 01:16:14]** I think you had found some tarps and put them over them to kind of hide the glare from any prying eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:15 - 01:16:21]** There's not like a Hanes manual and a mechanic's toolkit to maybe repair some shit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:26]** If you want to take time to do the UPB thing, we can do that, but otherwise, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:27 - 01:16:30]** See, I would, but I have no engineering ranks.

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:34]** So, like, Colin doesn't know what to do with UPBs at all.

**[01:16:35 - 01:16:36]** Yeah, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:40]** I mean, we can.

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:46]** You're not, you're, if I move you guys to the map, I mean, you can if you want.

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:50]** You are roughly a couple hours away.

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:53]** If I look at just how far this is.

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:56]** You're less than 200 miles away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:56 - 01:17:11]** And I guess what would happen, I think Colin would come back to the car and be reminded, I think we're close, but we're one tall speed bump away from this thing not running.

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:19]** So is there a way for us to repair just a little bit so we can make sure to get there in one piece?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:21 - 01:17:22]** I can help with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:23 - 01:17:23]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:25]** Okay.

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:28]** Here's will help.

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:31]** And I think Dr. Okay as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:32]** Yeah.

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:33]** Okay.

**[01:17:33 - 01:17:33]** Yeah.

**[01:17:34 - 01:17:37]** You are able to, I think you need to give me an engineering check.

**[01:17:38 - 01:17:40]** I'm pulling up this stuff right now.


## Speaker_0

**[01:17:42 - 01:17:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:44]** And Dr. Okay assists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:45 - 01:17:46]** Okay.

**[01:17:46 - 01:17:50]** So that's 24 and you all use some of your UPBs that you have, right?

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:55]** So that's going to cost, um, you can do up to eight spending one hour performing repairs.

**[01:17:56 - 01:17:59]** So that's eight hit points back with one hour.

**[01:17:59 - 01:18:04]** Uh, well now it, I don't know how many UPBs you guys have in the entire party.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:06]** Uh, we've got enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:07 - 01:18:09]** Yeah, so... You have a lot, I think.

**[01:18:09 - 01:18:12]** Yeah, so I'm not sure who's keeping track, but you just used 80.

**[01:18:12 - 01:18:13]** 5,000?

**[01:18:13 - 01:18:14]** Is that right?

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:16]** Okay.

**[01:18:16 - 01:18:17]** Do you want to do another one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:18 - 01:18:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:19]** Okay.

**[01:18:20 - 01:18:21]** So you're going to spend two hours doing that?

**[01:18:22 - 01:18:22]** Sure.

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:23]** Okay.

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:24]** Give me another engineer check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:27 - 01:18:28]** I assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:29 - 01:18:30]** Okay.

**[01:18:30 - 01:18:31]** Oh, uh, okay.

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:33]** I got a...

**[01:18:33 - 01:18:36]** Uh, you have higher engineering than me, right?

**[01:18:36 - 01:18:37]** 12.

**[01:18:38 - 01:18:39]** I don't know anymore.

**[01:18:39 - 01:18:40]** What's your engineering?

**[01:18:40 - 01:18:42]** You might have higher engineering than me at this point.

**[01:18:42 - 01:18:42]** 14.

**[01:18:44 - 01:18:44]** Yeah, he should have gone.

**[01:18:45 - 01:18:50]** Uh, but it's, I only rolled a 12, so I guess that would only be a 14 total unless you want to retcon that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:50 - 01:18:51]** But so 16.

**[01:18:51 - 01:18:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:53 - 01:18:55]** The 14, unless someone else assists.

**[01:18:56 - 01:18:57]** Bernice for example.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:58 - 01:18:58]** Yeah.

**[01:18:58 - 01:19:02]** Bernice can, I think.

**[01:19:02 - 01:19:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:27]** mean i could hack it for another hour too if it like failed that's fine yeah let's say that you do you get another eight so i don't know how many hours you guys want to spend but two sounds like so that's 16 more for uh rick and collins yeah i will mark that on here it'll probably get you there hopefully no uh holes open up on the five freeway

**[01:19:30 - 01:19:33]** You had 7 to begin with, so 16.

**[01:19:34 - 01:19:36]** So we're at 16 total or 16 plus 7?

**[01:19:37 - 01:19:39]** You're at 16 plus 7, so you're at 23.

**[01:19:40 - 01:19:41]** Okay.

**[01:19:43 - 01:19:49]** You start moving towards Terrapin.

**[01:19:49 - 01:19:52]** You are headed back.

**[01:19:53 - 01:19:55]** To see you're back on the road.

**[01:19:56 - 01:19:59]** You had a nice night.

**[01:19:59 - 01:19:59]** Whoa.

**[01:20:01 - 01:20:01]** What was that?

**[01:20:01 - 01:20:02]** Calm down there, buddy.

**[01:20:02 - 01:20:03]** We're close.

**[01:20:03 - 01:20:05]** We're not that close.

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:06]** Still, give me one more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:06 - 01:20:07]** My bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:07 - 01:20:08]** A little premature there, John.

**[01:20:09 - 01:20:11]** Yeah, that was, that was, that was, that was not me.

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:11]** That was Vinny.

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:21]** Uh, you are, you had a nice night, a chance, a respite, respite, however you're supposed to say it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:21 - 01:20:22]** Uh, I suppose apparently the Brits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:24]** And welcome.

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:30]** Maybe your thoughts are a little more focused, a little clearer now that you're headed on your way to Terrapin.

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:33]** The terrain's moving pretty quickly.

**[01:20:33 - 01:20:33]** You feel good.

**[01:20:34 - 01:20:41]** After a while, you can see the landscape start to rise up as you feel like you're coming and start to get a little more hilly.

**[01:20:41 - 01:20:43]** You're starting to move in between channels.

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:44]** There are more lava pools.

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:49]** There's more of a rough, difficult terrain you experience.

**[01:20:48 - 01:20:50]** have to slow down a little bit.

**[01:20:50 - 01:20:57]** You're, you're still going to make it in the morning, but you, you just have to be a little bit more cautious with how you are moving across the landscape.

**[01:20:57 - 01:21:13]** And maybe this sense, this like sense of dread is starting to pull into you as you're realizing, like you're getting closer and closer to possibly getting off and possibly finding out what has been going on here and what happened at Turcalis.

**[01:21:18 - 01:21:21]** You've come into a particularly difficult path, a little bit tortuous.

**[01:21:22 - 01:21:30]** You're making your own path through a really rough landscape and the ground becomes a lot more difficult to drive over.

**[01:21:30 - 01:21:34]** You're starting to navigate between different pits of lava.

**[01:21:35 - 01:21:40]** Some of these hills are starting to crest up even further and you can't see through them.

**[01:21:40 - 01:21:47]** You're in these mini valleys and you are having to pull around these different spikes of lava.

**[01:21:47 - 01:21:51]** You come into one that has its own little microclimate for a little bit.

**[01:21:51 - 01:21:52]** The heat is hazy.

**[01:21:52 - 01:21:54]** It makes it a little difficult to see ahead.

**[01:21:56 - 01:21:59]** You start to slow down kind of significantly.

**[01:21:59 - 01:22:03]** And something doesn't feel right.

**[01:22:06 - 01:22:17]** As you're turning the corner, there are little rock outcroppings on the left and the right that cast shadows that only appear when there's a burst of the lava and then disappear.

**[01:22:17 - 01:22:22]** And you're realizing there are these larger shapes around you because of where the sun is.

**[01:22:23 - 01:22:24]** It's tough to see.

**[01:22:25 - 01:22:27]** Until as you come around the corner.

**[01:22:29 - 01:22:29]** Up on the right.

**[01:22:31 - 01:22:32]** About 20 feet in the air.

**[01:22:34 - 01:22:35]** The haze.

**[01:22:37 - 01:22:44]** simmers away, burns away, and you see a pair of red eyes staring at you.

**[01:22:46 - 01:22:49]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:49 - 01:22:50]** Dragon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:50 - 01:22:53]** We found the dragon, y'all.

**[01:22:54 - 01:22:55]** Yeah.

**[01:22:55 - 01:22:55]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:22:56 - 01:22:57]** Oh, no.

**[01:22:58 - 01:22:59]** Oh, f***.
