**[00:03:11 - 00:03:32]** just i just want to tell you guys something that i think kelly already knew and i think kev already knows but can i just say that taiwan and especially japan some of like the coolest places on earth just i had like the best time what was your favorite thing what uh good question okay uh in taiwan

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:40]** There were two favorite things that one like so our friend's dad was showing us around because he's a professional tour guide.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** Like he studied it.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** He's done it for like decades now.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** So he travels the world as a tour guide.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:48]** And so then he was like, well, I'll just show you around my home.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:51]** So we were mostly in Taipei City, but then we went north a bit.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:54]** and closer to where they're at.

**[00:03:54 - 00:04:05]** And first we went to this awesome town called Jofen, which is supposedly the inspiration for Spirited Away, for the like city in Spirited Away.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:07]** And if you Google it, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:09]** And like the red lanterns and everything, it is awesome.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:13]** And the day that we were there, it ended up being very misty and kind of rainy.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** So it's like,

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:40]** with all the photos and everything we go in and they're famous for their tea houses too so we're like having tea looking out over the bay and the mountain and it's like misty and these red lanterns and these like tight packed alleys with all these little shops that you definitely just get lost in and and you're like hey i'll just be a minute and then you walk back out and you're like where where did they go and i feel like i was in spirited away i feel like i would just like go into a strange door dream world place

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** Dreamworld, yeah.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:41]** Spirit World.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** So that was awesome.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** They're really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:44]** Yeah.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** Oh, no, I'm sorry, man.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** This is a big story.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:52]** I was going to say, like, the really cool thing about Asia is you could just go into, like, an alley and then it goes.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** There's a smaller alley off of that and a smaller alley off of that.

**[00:04:55 - 00:05:00]** And you end up in, like, some crazy place, which sounds like that was your experience.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** So that's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:01]** That was exactly it.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:05]** Well, but to get there, though, you got to take, like, three trains.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** Including one that, like, goes up the mountain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:34]** what was that well i was gonna say you go down a dark alley and then you end up getting entered in the kimete and then you fight uh chong wing and the final box battle and yeah yeah i'd be cool with that david dukes or somebody dukes dukes dukes rayu david dukes was the like

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:37]** No, not the KKK member guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** Yeah, I was like, whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** Dukes, where are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** What is that?

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** Frank Dukes.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:47]** Frank Dukes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** Is he a street fighter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** Daisy Dukes?

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Come on, nobody watched Bloodsport?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:54]** Yes.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** Long time ago.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** Yeah, 20 years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** John, what were you... It was just yesterday.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:01]** What happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** It was just yesterday.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** For Will, time is a flat circle.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:08]** So for him, it was just yesterday.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** He was watching it for the first time.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:23]** We also did the lantern signing, where you sign the lanterns, and then with different parts of your life, like love, and career, and family, and friends, and all that stuff, and finances.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:28]** And then you write these wishes on them, and then you put them in this balloon that floats away.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** And that was super cool.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** It's on fire.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** Yeah, it's on fire.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:56]** It literally just lights on fire Thousand percent better Yeah 100% I also had some of the best soup and pork bowl that I've ever had at this place called Dark Palace in Taiwan if you few it sounds like Palace Obscura like in threefold, but it's but it's literally called Dark Palace It's just like a house

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:58]** Yeah, right?

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** Yeah, it turns out Palace Obscura is just a restaurant.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** It's really good.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:04]** They all just wanted to work there.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** It's in Tamsui.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:10]** I'm not saying it right, but Tamsui.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:12]** And it's been there for forever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** This place looks good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:18]** Yeah, and our friend's dad was like, oh, I went here when I was a kid.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:22]** And so it was cool to see him talk about it.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:25]** He said that for the longest time they didn't have AC.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** So up until the last decade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:29]** Climate change and all that stuff, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** Yeah.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:30]** Yeah.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** I'm pretty sure Taiwan is always.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** Yeah, pretty sure.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:36]** Want AC if they could have it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:38]** It's been a long, persistent problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:40]** It's been a long, persistent problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** They were the first to feel climate change.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** A rather equatorial country, I'd say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** Yeah.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:54]** I mean, so like when I think about, I've never been to the Far East, but like coastal beach towns, but also like...

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:01]** I very specifically avoided that word, actually.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:03]** Is it that bad of a word?

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** It's not that bad of a word.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:04]** I guess it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** I don't know anymore.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** Anyways.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:06]** I don't know.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** I never thought of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:19]** It was, but maybe I... The last time I researched it, it was... My Googling said that there was a very clear populace that took offense to being called Oriental.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** Yeah, but... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** Well, we didn't say that.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:22]** We didn't say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** So it seems like a half step away.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** We didn't say that.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:25]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:30]** From my understanding, you can call objects that, but not people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** That's right.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:34]** I feel like that's true of a lot of things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:39]** We successfully avoided angering an entire continent, nearly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** Thank you.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:44]** We successfully avoided angering an entire continent so far.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** We're only five minutes in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:51]** There's still at least another hour to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** Yeah.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:59]** No, but it's like beachy, warm towns because it's an island chain, but also like huge mountains.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:05]** So like cool, brisk air or like stuffy, humid, like what's the vibe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** Very humid.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:08]** But I was also there in like February.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** So still winter ish.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** So it's still gonna get worse, bro.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:11]** It was cold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:12]** Yeah.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** You went in like a good time.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:17]** Cause it, uh, it gets, it gets bad real fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** It's unbearably hot.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:18]** Yeah.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:20]** I was very happy about that in Japan too.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:25]** It was like the perfect, like cold a bit, uh, nice, some nice days.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:36]** And then actually, so we went to Tokyo and then Kyoto and then on the way back from Kyoto to Tokyo, went to Hakone, which is this like spa town, uh, where, or like, it's like spa town.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Unpack that please.

**[00:09:37 - 00:10:01]** it's three towns right kelly it's like hakone gora and uh another spot and they're all along this mountain and it's it's like an hour from tokyo so like it's a there are a bunch of natural hot springs there where where there are all these ryokans and hotels that have spas there or onsens that you can go to and it's it's like the number one onsen place in japan

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** Yeah, and it was beautiful.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:08]** And we were leaving Kyoto, and it had been a bit rainy and then sunny.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:11]** And then we're going back, and we're like, let's say it's going to rain in Hakone.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:14]** All right, well, the rain is still beautiful in the mountains.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:14]** That's fine.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:17]** So we start going up, and we're like, wow,

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:38]** this rain's kind of thick like this like kind of intense rain and then we get to the top we're like cool it's just full-on snowing at sunset and by the time we get in the room at like twilight it was it was literally like a winter scene falling snow like i'll send pictures in the discord i think i have but i'll send more because why have you not done so beautiful dang it

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:43]** Yeah, well, I put some in the supporters-only channel.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** I put a lot more there.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** But I will drop some for Hakone.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:47]** It was just beautiful.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** And then you're chilling in the onsen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:55]** It's just like Western ignorance is that all of Asia is hot and sticky.

**[00:10:55 - 00:11:05]** But like one time when, when my boat pulled in, we had guys on my boat that brought their own snowboards and then like stored them somewhere on the ship to Korea, to Japan, Japan.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:09]** And we, we pulled into Yokosuka and they took a train to go.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:10]** Is it Nagasaki?

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:13]** Is that where the, the, that's north, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** That's quite a ways away.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:15]** Yeah.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:15]** Wouldn't know.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** It'd be Nagano probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** Nagano.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** Nagano.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** You're right.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:19]** Nagano.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:19]** Yeah.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:24]** And so they went to Nagano and they snowboarded down Nagano and then came back to the boat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:24]** Yeah.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:24]** The ski.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:25]** That's so cool.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:32]** Snow stuff is really good there for snowboarding and skiing, which I still have not done there, which is really weird, but like it.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** Really, really good.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:07]** And a lot of unusual stuff, but not as unusual as in Taiwan.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:13]** But of course, we also went to the convenience stores in Japan and in Taiwan, which were freaking awesome.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** Those were, of course.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** This is the entire point of you going, but whatever.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:26]** It's all right.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:28]** Just don't take my recommendations.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:30]** At least you took the Hakone recommendation.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:30]** Dude, happy about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:32]** I took a lot of your recommendations.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:32]** Wow.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:35]** I feel like I need to qualify my whole trip live on air right now.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:37]** I'm sorry, Kelly.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:37]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** This was a dream for you, man.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** I'm glad you went.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:46]** I remember a buddy of mine, me and a friend, we went out and I think it was Korea.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:50]** And we were just like, let's go where nobody else is going.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:54]** And we just roamed into like the part of town where no other sailors were walking.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** And we got hungry.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** We're like, oh, what are we going to eat?

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** And we found this little back door that had a sign.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:04]** And so we knocked on the door and we walked inside and it was literally a kitchen.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:09]** And this older woman who didn't speak any English and we don't speak any Korean.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:11]** And we're like, ah.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:34]** and she actually like put up her finger and like had us wait and she ran next door and got her granddaughter to come over and translate and we ended up just like getting a you talk about like like the food there we just had a pork leg it was just like like the thigh of a pig stewed

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** That's probably awesome.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** Oh, it was amazing.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:39]** It was some of the best food I've ever had.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:43]** And I was just like, I don't know what this is or what I'm eating, but it was delicious.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:46]** And I enjoyed every second of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** But that was a back alley of a back alley.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:51]** Speaking of things and back alleys we enjoy...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:54]** Speaking of random doors that just open in a small place.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Sorry that I totally co-opted the entire banter.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Finder's probably happy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:01]** But yeah.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:07]** Finder can relax this time because that was great because I just want to hear more about your trip forever.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:09]** And you are posting stuff on the Discord.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:13]** Also, I want to welcome the left-hander to the Discord.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** They joined us recently, so...

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:22]** Yeah, join the Discord and come check out Jon's photos, which he still has only posted 10% of, apparently.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:27]** So you, like me, can be disappointed that we haven't seen the snow picture yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** I did post more in the supporters channel.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:33]** So if you are able and want to do that, then there's some more in there as well.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:35]** But I'll post more in the general as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** If you become a supporter, you can see more.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:37]** Exactly.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:43]** But give some of us plebs some of your other photos, please.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:44]** Yes.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** The plebs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** Yeah, because I forgot that plebs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:48]** Finder's seen it all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** Finder's seen everything.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** He's at the top.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:50]** I mean, he's here with us.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:51]** Finder has his own channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** Don't anyone else get jealous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** Yeah, he does.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** It's pretty sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:56]** I managed to squeeze that out of us.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** I didn't even know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:06]** Speaking of channels that I want to shout out before we get started here, I do also want to quickly shout out the folks, which includes Finder, the folks in the 3FC Game Masters only channel.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:14]** That would be JM, Boss Wick, Grumpus, Nick Drozda, Takumon, and Finder.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** And if there's anybody else that has jumped in, I apologize.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:26]** But everybody in that channel, just want to give you a quick shout out and say thank you because y'all are so great to talk about this AP and what you're doing or have done and what we're doing here.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** And how to with us.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** Yeah.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** And all the fun and the mystery.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:34]** It's definitely thanks to y'all.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:34]** Yeah.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:37]** I don't know if we should be thanking them or not, but thanks for helping John.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** That's very nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:40 - 00:16:08]** yeah really i'm looking for like a more malicious term for tom fullery because like that's malicious shenanigans shenanigan shenanigans we just asked stf because they are the original owners of the tom fuller right yeah so yeah it's true it's true they originally uh coined the phrase back in 1768 yeah i wouldn't be surprised if will was there in the room

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:08]** when it happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** Probably was, probably was.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** We'll talk about being in the room.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:19]** I do want to hear about y'all's, uh, the awesome rooms that you guys have been in, AKA sweet travel that y'all have done.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:21]** That, that was my planned banter topic.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:29]** I didn't plan to talk about Tokyo and Japan or, and, uh, Taiwan the whole time, but next time I will ask you all about your, uh, travels.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:29]** Yeah.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:45]** Let's talk about the travel that your characters did to Corundum, the name given to this found mine by the Azer refugees from the city of Brass who are currently inhabiting it.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:55]** Last time, here's your exploration into the remains of the computer system of this mine.

**[00:16:55 - 00:17:02]** Tell a story of discovery, oppression, and retribution.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:22]** Ringworks, the galactic corporate powerhouse, had started an off-books dig site run by Azers and Shireen, excavating the rocks underneath Varos, looking for anything abnormal.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:31]** And what they found was that some of the original rocks here were formed by

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:42]** pre-gap like before varus became an active volcano moon

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:51]** The site was called, in Ringworks Parley, Aeon Star No.

**[00:17:51 - 00:18:04]** 6 as a reference to the comet that exploded into the moon of Galerion, the comet whose pieces were then the bringers of Earthfall in ancient Galerion.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:13]** This information though was not enough because they hadn't, there were no red crystals.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:19]** All that they found were that these rocks were of a particular age.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:33]** And so the Ringworks leaders pushed these workers harder and harder as the leaders themselves were pressured by corporate and others to produce results.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:43]** And this pressure resulted in an equal and opposite force as the workers retaliated.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:45]** Exactly.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:50]** Causing the only way out.

**[00:18:50 - 00:19:04]** It seems that they could at that time, which was to cause some sort of a magma overflow, wiping out a great deal of the site, changing the landscape around it, literally and wiping out most of the inhabitants until

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:07]** The Azers of the city of Nebraska came in.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:15]** Dr. O'Kay was working on equipment, finding out some more from this book of Dr. Nodens.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:21]** Colin was helping the locals to heal and maybe take a moment to relax.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:31]** Rick19 was chatting with the AAF member, PD, when suddenly all the Azers run.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:39]** you all make your way underneath the cooking tent, I believe.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:43]** And I'll pull you guys over to the map as the ground was shaking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:50]** In the back room, working on the list of items, trying to integrate one with Bernice.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:51]** Exactly.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:58]** You were, you were, uh, but then Colin, Rick and here's were in, we're out in the open.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:04]** So, and you were on comms with them as here's was talking about some of the things that he had found.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:11]** And it's at that time that you hear that Mirko comes over.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:22]** And as there's this trembling of the ground, this shaking, Mirko comes over and just whispers, is trying to be quiet, and whispers the word dragon to you.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:26]** And I am activating you all on the map here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:30]** And the dragon as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:32]** And the dragon as well.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** What do you all do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:37]** There's this.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:38]** Okay.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** You draw your weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** We kill them all.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:43]** Are you sure you don't want to try to negotiate with the dragon?

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** I'll negotiate.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:47]** I just want to shoot him in the face like you do everything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:50]** Talk down, not up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:51]** All right.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** Can I ask a meta question?

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** Yeah.

**[00:20:54 - 00:21:05]** So, like, when thinking about dragons, I'm kind of stuck in the 5e world of, like, okay, metallic dragons are generally speaking good and color dragons are generally speaking evil or malicious.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:14]** And so, like, is the same generally true of Starfinder or is it just, like, dragons are dragons and they just want to eat you and shit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** Uh...

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:18]** Yeah, there are chromatic dragons and there are metallic dragons.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** Chromatic dragons are usually evil.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:24]** Metallic dragons are generally good and try to better society.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:25]** Cool.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:27]** They're all sentient though, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** Yeah.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** Yeah, I think dragons are generally highly intelligent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** Yeah.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** Or metallic dragons.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** Just as creatures go.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:34]** Colored dragons.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** And classic chromatic ones.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** RPGs, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:40]** I thought they were... No, they're pretty intelligent.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:40]** Primal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** No, they're...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:44]** At least in Starfinder, they are very, very tall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:47]** We only ever encountered one dragon in our D&D game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** You did?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:53]** I ended up burning a roof to distract it or something.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** We stole its egg, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:00]** We f***ed up that campaign.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:05]** One day you'll make it to... So bad that we switched to Starfinder and started recording a podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** No, you didn't screw it up.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:13]** We just put it on hold and I just continually tell Kelly that one day we will get to Butterscroll Ranch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** Actually, I finally forgot about it.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:17]** Thanks for putting that back on my...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:21]** Yet all the butter in his fridge is shaped like a skull.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:25]** He carves every one into a skull.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** Kelly still dreams of it.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** All right, so what are you doing?

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:30]** Mirko is hunched down with you.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:36]** There's a sense of anticipation and also a bit of patience.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** Because Mirko doesn't seem too worried.

**[00:22:39 - 00:23:01]** but as your crow is the um afraidy yeah okay so rick 19 you pull your weapon you start to hear some like some like rocks start to fall a little bit as like the ceiling itself starts to come down a little bit what does everyone do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** I mean, I guess this wakes us up.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Are we sleeping?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:06]** No, no, no.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:07]** You weren't sleeping.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** You were just in the middle of your day.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** It was close to the end of the day.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:16]** Here's you had just read out all the information that you had downloaded from the computers.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:19]** Not in a tent with Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:21]** Rudy told Hears about these dragons, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** He did.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:25]** Yeah, because you then forgot to tell everyone Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:28]** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** Rudy, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** Rudy mentioned that they were only adolescents.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:37]** So Rick is going to say that it's only a small dragon, right?

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:42]** And he's going to lift his gun up on his shoulder and start marching towards the door.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** He starts walking out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:49]** As you do, Mirko's like, Rick, Rick, no, wait, wait, wait.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:49]** Hey, come back.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:50]** Come back.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** It's okay.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:51]** Come back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** Colin, you have your hands raised.

**[00:23:53 - 00:24:00]** I think I want to make a wisdom check to figure out if this is like a dire, like, okay, gun's drawn.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** We need to handle this.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:03]** A fight that we can potentially win.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:07]** Or if this is one of those, like, just hide out, let it pass.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** Give me a check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** It's about to not be an option.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:13]** That's what Rick's doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:16]** That's a three on the die for a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:17]** Three on the die for a seven.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:18]** You don't know.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:21]** It's fine to go out and do sex.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:26]** That sounds like a great idea.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:28]** That sounds like a great idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:33]** Colin burned his grits this morning and he stubbed his toe and he's just itching for a fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:41]** Rick, you start walking out and that shaking begins to stop and Mirko's like, wait a minute.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:59]** And as soon as you turn around and see Mirko start to like beckon you back, there's this loud like sense of, it feels like the roof is starting to shake somehow like even more and these rocks start to,

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:26]** start to fall down and and then there's one chunk in particular that like you think as you look up it seems like it's right over where all the tents are and this massive stone just just comes down with a big piece of red crystal probably the largest here that you might have seen on its own that just falls

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:35]** And smashes into the house right next to the three tables, crushing the front corner of the house.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:40]** And you hear this cry inside.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** Oh, no.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:45]** And then the shaking stops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:46]** What do you all do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:51]** Well, we should probably go check that person out and make sure they're okay.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** I guess you're going to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** Yeah, I think Colin immediately moves in that direction.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** Okay.

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** I don't know if we're in third order and I have like movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** No, you run over.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** Mirko is also running over.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** Colin spreads over to look for survivors.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:12]** It is just one of the cleanest hits, it seems like.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:19]** One of the sides of the crystal is just cut clean through the walls of the house.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:24]** And just like whatever shelving was there, whatever appliance was there, just cut right through.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:29]** And you're pushing past this crystal and you look into the house.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:40]** I don't know if you've been in these before, but these are clearly some sort of like worker, small hut, very bare, a sink, a bed, a toilet, a closet, a desk.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:54]** There's not much in there, but as soon as with, with the light of everything in there, you can see that, uh, Steven pyrolite is laying on the ground and the lower half of their right leg, their, the,

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:58]** Their leg is not connected to their body.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:01]** It is sticking out from underneath the crystal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:07]** Uh, here's, is going to call calling over or is he with him?

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** Oh, that's where it is.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** Rick is at the wrong house.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:36]** here's over here oh it's over here yeah i'll help i'll help you yeah thanks this is blind apparently you can't see like a giant red crystal like going through a house but like yeah i mean i'm not trained but let me know what to do let's see let's see let's see what can i do goodness gracious uh i feel like a serum feeling is is a band-aid on a bullet hole um you can start with that uh yeah let's start with a serum okay okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:37]** Okay.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** I see him revealing mark one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:41]** Immediately hits him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:43]** Just stab him right in the leg.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** Yeah.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:55]** You see that some of the damage around his leg where it's been like clearly just shore off is starting to recover.

**[00:27:55 - 00:28:01]** And give me a medicine check too, Colin.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:02]** Sure.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:16]** While you're doing that, Mirko, I mean, Petey and Delamar and some of the other Azers are walking over quickly, and Mirko, seeing that you are taking care of this right now, is saying, please, stand back, stand back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** It's going to be all right.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** It's going to be all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:23]** Trying to just make way for you all and let you do whatever you need to do.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** Yeah, that's a 19 medicine.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** 19 medicine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** We should probably get Dr. Okay.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** Someone needs help over here.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:34]** If you could please assist Colin.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** I really suck at this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** Yes, okay.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:40]** I'll meander over there in a second.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:43]** Bernice, you stay here and continue working.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:50]** You are able to, Colin, stop the bleeding as Dr. K is coming over, going to help you set up some long-term.

**[00:28:50 - 00:29:09]** But Colin, as you're working through both the combination of your initial medicine check and the serum of healing has started to cause the wound to heal up a little bit, at least some of the skin and what's there to either grow quickly or just tighten up.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:14]** But it's an interesting thing because you're looking and you're seeing that there were

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:33]** shards of the crystal in the wound in his leg he's passed out and the crystal has actually like fused and as you were doing your medicine check the crystal was almost helping to stop the bleeding of his leg

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** Dr. O'Kay shows up.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:37]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:40]** I think he tells Dr. O'Kay what he saw.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:44]** Doctor, I think this crystal might have some sort of healing property.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:53]** I've done work on trauma victims before, but this is uncanny, the way that the skin has tightened itself.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** And look at the scar tissue here.

**[00:29:56 - 00:30:04]** And he points to some red-tinted scar tissue that was clearly the work of the crystal shards in the wound, not necessarily Colin doing anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:26]** have you ever seen something like this before can i do a medicine check to see what might be uh or like a physical i guess maybe that's a life science check i don't know yeah i would say either physical science life science or uh or that yeah okay and i gotta forge


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:30]** 13 on the die for a 30.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** For a 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:44]** This crystal, you don't know what this crystal is, but you do know that it seems like it has this ability where it can heal hit points.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:45]** Oh, cool.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:48]** Not very many, but at least raw.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:52]** If you were to synthesize something, yeah.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:57]** Yeah, if you could synthesize, maybe there's something, but you would obviously need a lab or research time to figure that out.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** Like my custom micro lab?

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:02]** Perhaps, to change its properties, yeah.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** But raw...

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:09]** at least applying it to a wound does seem to heal one hit point mechanically.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:18]** And the fact, and you think that even broken down, even part of it, like if you were to ingest it, it would heal it as well.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:28]** So it functions both as like a thing that you could eat if you could synthesize it into something you could eat, and then something that can immediately heal one hit point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:40]** I'm sorry, I don't want to laugh at it, but it's one of those, like, if you're standing under this crystal and it, like, crushes you, you're cooked, but it still heals you.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:43]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:45]** Just enough to keep you alive.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** Yeah.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** To suffer under a crystal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:53]** So you did technically, first aid, stop the bleeding, and they are stable.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:55]** Colin, Dr. O'K, what were you going to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:55 - 00:32:07]** I want to take a scrape off of this crystal, if possible, and run a chemilizer analysis according to the rules for it.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** That's probably going to take a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:10]** Yeah?

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** Yeah.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:18]** I can... Colin, you... I got a plus four circumstance bonus.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:18]** Okay.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:27]** To a physical science check to identify an unknown drug, medicinal poison, or other chemical substance.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:27]** Got it.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** And how long does that take?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** It doesn't say.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** Okay.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:38]** I'm going to say just in the short term, since there's somebody unconscious in front of you, it will probably just take a minute for you to set it up and...

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:45]** Colin or Dr. OK, Mirko comes over now that some people are starting to back off for a second, but they're waiting intensely.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:47]** And she says, hey, is he all right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** Is he going to be all right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:50]** What happened?

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:54]** She can't quite see in, but then she looks over and...

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:59]** sees that he's an amputee and nods and looks at both of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:03]** He's stable currently.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** He took a pretty hard hit.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** It's shorn his leg off at the knee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:10]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:10]** All right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:11]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** But he'll survive.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:15]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:21]** We'll need some place to set up a long-term care, right?

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** I think that might be good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:32]** I'm looking at page 143 of long-term care to see what that is.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:36]** Yeah, it requires a medical lab or a medical bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:42]** I think I have an upgraded medical from... I think you do, too.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:47]** For now, what do you all want to do?

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Where do you want to set this up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:51]** We could take 20 on it, too, apparently.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:56]** Oh, well, no, it says you can't take 20 on mess and checks to provide long term.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** I read that wrong.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:04]** In terms of what to do, I mean, I've never tried to do something like this before.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:12]** I don't know if this is like out of left field entirely, but like would here's being an engineer be able to engineer some kind of.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:37]** limb for him some usable prosthetic sort of thing that's a great question if i had the materials i don't know if we could use i know that we have those i forget what the raw materials are called starfinder yeah those like if i could make something for him i'm curious we could look into that and he's okay thanks and then he'll probably need some crutches goodwill with these people i have an idea that's crazy just just just


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:37]** Yeah.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** We take the severed limb.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:42]** We take some of the little dust filings off this shard.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:48]** We resever the severed part of this dude's leg where the knee's at.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:53]** We put a little diamond dust on it and just meld it back together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:57]** You don't know if it'll do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:59]** That's why I want to do the chemilizer.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:02]** Exactly, to figure it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** It's worth trying.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** We could always cut it off later.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** He's in the same boat either way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:06]** Sorry, it didn't work.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:09]** I got a radical idea, guys.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:20]** I mean, they can attach severed limbs if it's quick enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:38]** Yeah, so you might be able to... The doctor, Lydia Searstone, she comes over and says that you can bring him to the tent that she has set up, which is over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:48]** Doctor, I think the more difficult task might be to get this giant red crystal off the piece of his leg under it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:50]** Yeah.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:59]** Does anyone have a lever, a fulcrum that we can, you know, like, get some leverage, just pry this thing up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Oh, you might be able to have something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:11]** I think somebody said, give me a fulcrum and a large enough ballast and I'll move the world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** We have a 12-foot-tall Afridi.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:28]** I'm sure that her strength check is... Yeah, I mean, that's the first thing that you see happen is that she walks over and is going to try, along with several of the others.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:31]** They walk over.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:35]** Grumdahlia grabs...

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:56]** um at like some extra poles and some some things that she has to try and use her strength to pry from the other side and mirko walks over and just puts both of her hands even though they're like there's some cuts and just starts to try and like strong man like gets down really low and just puts her knees low and then tries to

**[00:36:56 - 00:37:00]** swing out and swing back as some of the others.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:04]** I'm, I'm assuming that by now you've moved Steven, Steven into the tent.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Yep.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Yep.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:09]** Steven, Steven, Steven, Paul, you're like, I didn't expect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:10]** Okay.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:10]** Yeah.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** Yeah.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:18]** Um, as long as we're talking about things that are going on concurrently and things that we want to do, I feel like here's is looking for the dragon.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** Cause that seems like a reasonable thing to do.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:23]** Is it still around or, or did it just brush by?

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:25]** And that's why this crystal like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:45]** film you're not sure there were there were just these tremors and uh it might be worth you have earthworms coming to attack us don't don't don't high salute uh uh so but mirko seemed to know about this so it might be worth once mirko is done moving this crystal it might be worth uh

**[00:37:45 - 00:38:01]** Talking to her to see you I mean unless you walk to the surface right now You don't hear any more tremors and people don't seem to be freaking out about what's going on just a reminder of the who's who of corundum

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:25]** uh there's the falgrim ember heart uh who was the butler who originally greeted you uh there was the chef zyra red forge there was the mechanic gramdahlia scarchbeard uh there was stephen pyre light who was the engineer who was really excited about talking with rick uh there and then there's the doctor lydia searstone and then there's the the

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:35]** Originally was a groundskeeper, Ferex Heatwarden, the one who had the wound that Colm was dealing with, and then Colm was sharing a drink with him.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:42]** And then there's Mirko Pyraxilian, who is the former employer, and then now just the E-Freedy there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** Was Steven one that you added?

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** Because his name is Steven.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:49]** Everyone else has unique Starfinder-y names.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:53]** Did you just add Steven to get cut up by a plot device?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:55]** He's the red shirt with the red crystal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:59]** Yeah, he's the red crystal.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** Steven is f***ed.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:04]** Don't ask Finder these questions.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:08]** Okay, so you are, let's just say, though, that you're on alert.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** You're trying to think about what the dragon is.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** Colin and Dr.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:17]** O.K., you are possibly, or sorry, Colin, you're starting to see to Steven with Lydia.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** Dr.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:20]** O.K., you are working on a chemilizer test.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:22]** And Rick19, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** I think he's still kind of just standing watch.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:28]** He's got his gun focused on that kind of entryway in case something comes in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** Okay, sounds good.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:43]** They're able to move the, with the help of Mirko and some of the leverage from Grondalia, they're able to move the stone just out into the middle of the path there.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:50]** It's probably seven, eight feet tall, almost as round.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:54]** And you can see as the light glistens inside.

**[00:39:54 - 00:40:00]** I mean, it is definitely one of the most beautiful natural crystals that you've ever seen, the way the light reflects inside.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:02]** It's definitely got a great clarity.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:07]** I was trying to think of my diamond terms to say what those are, but I can't think of them.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Very, very slight inclusion.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** Very slight.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Thank you.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** Very VSI.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** Very slight inclusions.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** Grade.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:13]** What?

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** Like, like D E. Is that right?

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Is that like a VPS?

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** Yeah.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** Yeah.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** Yeah.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:22]** Yeah.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:23]** Yeah.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** Yeah.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** Yeah.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:27]** Yeah.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:52]** yeah yeah uh okay let's so dr okay you are using the uh let's let's go to you first you are looking at the lab at the custom micro lab and let me just pull that up here and what was the role that you had i had a 19 plus i get a plus four circumstance bonus with a chemilizer plus my stat and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:54]** For a 36 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:58]** For a 36 total.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** And you're doing a life science?

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:01]** No, physical science.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** A physical science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:06]** To identify the substance and try to discern what its properties are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** Great question.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** Great question.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** I'll start with this.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** So, sorry, what's that total again?

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** 36.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:13]** 36.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** Incredible.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** Incredible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:20]** You are... That's why I stat buff my freaking science, yo.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:23]** That's why you have like... Science, bitch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** 10 degrees.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:27]** Science, bitch.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:29]** Yeah, science, bitch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:34]** This is a very difficult question in terms of DCs, but you nailed it.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:41]** You have not seen... There is nothing like this material in the catalog of the custom microlab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:46]** With that said, I'm going to write a paper on it, get myself a dissertation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:50]** You're going to one of them dissertations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:57]** If anyone wants to hear more of Will being a scientist, you should listen to our collab with Emergency Power Podcast.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:59]** In which he's Dr. Will Sagan.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** Super Sagan.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:01]** Yeah.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:03]** We called him Super Sagan.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:03]** Yeah.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:06]** Because he just rolled beautifully for every skill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:15]** The stress is like the... You guys rolled so poorly on that one, it just was bound to happen.


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:45]** you know especially sorry i know we're gonna piss finder off so much so like uh especially what's his name from hex grid don don god oh my god don is so funny yeah there was nothing left of him like at the beginning of that there really was he was in space wearing like a loincloth and had like nothing else yeah one eye that worked and then one arm that he was more machine than man and he was a sniper yeah yeah all right a couple things dr okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:46 - 00:43:00]** Based on the molecular structure of this and the actual chain compounds inside of all the different elements, you can see where this shares a lot of commonality with healing serums.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:04]** And again, you think you could probably...

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:24]** only get one HP out of it, but if you can apply it you can maybe apply it to Turning it into some sort of serum or chewable like a like tablet like kind of how it yeah like like a good berry yeah That that could help out with healing HP and

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:31]** So that is definitely a help because you have a pretty large supply now, and we know how hard it is to find things that heal HP.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:37]** So at the moment, with what you have, you could probably synthesize some of this into a chewable tablet.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** That tastes like a gummy.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:49]** One of the other things, though, is that, again, it's not in any known element database that you've seen or any sort of thing.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:53]** And one of the other odd things about it is that

**[00:43:56 - 00:44:15]** You think a lot of these chains, the way that they are formed, require base building blocks that need to be superheated and have magic involved.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:22]** And you look at the age of some of them, and you remember what Hears was saying about... Pre-gap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:40]** And you think some of this that's in this gem is pre-gap material that has base elements that can only be made with magic and superheated in forms that even in Starfinder terms are not superheated.

**[00:44:41 - 00:45:08]** may be common well let's let let's go with very uncommon right it would be the same as as saying like well i could only make this if i had a uh like cern or something you know i'm saying it's like you need a dedicated facility in order to create the amounts of energy and magic to put this together and even then it's still certainly more trial and maybe more error than trial

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:12]** So that's what your expert role finds out.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:14]** You find out literally everything about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:26]** Does my role allow me to see medical applications beyond, say, a chewable drug?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:31]** Or you think that there might be some, but you just might need more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:39]** You just might need more like my idea of severing his limb and reattaching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:46]** It's not going to allow you to feel that in like a super synthesized way, unfortunately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:48]** But is there technology that does that presently?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:54]** I actually don't know in Starfinder if there is some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** I would imagine that there is.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:59]** I'm going to look up how to reattach a lamp.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** My Google search history.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** I am down with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Yeah, right?

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:09]** Here's what will help research it in game if it comes to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** Just got to make sure to append Starfinder to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** I am down with this.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** I want it to happen.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:16]** But just from the material alone, you can't.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:18]** But I'm sure that there is something.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:25]** So I want to jump over to Hears and Rick for a second while you're looking that up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:28]** It just requires...

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:51]** uh you know microsurgical procedure in which case i think i could candle that with bernice okay okay i think there's a there's a regrowth serum because on stf uh no spoilers they have something like that there is a regeneration serum


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:52]** Is that what it is?

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Regeneration?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** So we're just going to grow him a new loon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** Yeah.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** There is a regeneration serum.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:57]** Cool.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:02]** But it takes like 24 hours and a ton of food.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:09]** You require a day's worth of food and fluids every hour that you are regenerating.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** That's pretty crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** But maybe it's possible.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:14]** And maybe some of that can be expedited.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:18]** And you won't need as much with some of the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** That's like regrowing the full limbs.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:25]** What if you just like cut, like he's saying, just shave off the ends and then stick them together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:27]** You shave off the ends and stick them together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** That's literally what you get.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:31]** You have to do damaged tissue removal.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** Right.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:36]** And then a little bit of bone repair, like, you know, throw some wires in there.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:44]** And then, you know, the soft tissue repair of like muscles and tendons, arteries and veins, your nerves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** It's not like it's brain surgery.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:52]** Any hack who's done, you know, one year medical school could do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** No problem.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:57]** Given one year of Starfinder Medical School could do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:03]** Let's put a pin in it for... If you've gone to medical school, please hop on our Discord and tell us how wrong you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:05]** Tell me how wrong I am.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:08]** Exactly.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:08]** Let us know.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:11]** So while this is happening...

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:36]** let's let's go back to uh mirko and here's and colin mirko comes over to you rick and sees that you are just totally on uh you are on let's say right you are you are just just on because i'm an android we never turn off exactly you are on trying to suss out what is happening walks over to um yeah do they do what elves do where they just meditate um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:39]** I count them.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:39]** 001?

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:42]** 00... I don't know.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:45]** She walks over and says...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:51]** I don't know if you've ever fought a dragon before, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** Here's, are you there too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** Because you were helping with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:55]** Let's take a look.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** Is he next to Rick?

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** I mean, you can move to wherever you need to be.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** Stephen's over here now.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:03]** I guess here's will come closer to Rick.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:04]** Okay.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** Yeah, she walks over to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:13]** I don't know if you've ever fought a dragon, either of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** I have not yet.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** Oh, is that a question?

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:20]** I have never fought a dragon.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:21]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** I haven't either.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** I've read stories.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:27]** So, here's the thing.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:29]** Sorry, here's.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** I didn't mean to make a pun on your name there.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:33]** Here's the situation.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** Here's the situation.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:39]** I don't... I don't... I have a theory.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:40]** Read.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** I have a theory.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:50]** that we are in this dragon's home.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:52]** One of them.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** And I'll tell you why.

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:04]** I think when we first came here there was an egg and I left it outside.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:11]** And I think that it might have been the dragon's egg.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:13]** Now

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:21]** We also found that entrance, but we closed up another one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:24]** And points up to where that large crystal had come from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** We closed that up.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:33]** It wasn't large, but it was large enough.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** And we were able to close it up a bit.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** Took most of our effort.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:46]** So I... This is probably the third time that it's happened.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:49]** And I think that that dragon's trying to get back in.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** If I had to guess.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** I don't know why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** But that's my guess.

**[00:50:55 - 00:51:00]** Are you trying to tell me that there was an egg here when you arrived?

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:01]** Aye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:03]** We just put it out.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** I don't know what it was from.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:10]** I'm not in the business of taking someone or something else's egg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** Dragons are sentient, correct?

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:17]** Do you think they feed on these crystals?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:21]** I know.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:29]** I'm not Dr. Oki or Dr. Eden Bran, but I don't think so.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** That seems a bit odd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:36]** Maybe it has a broken limb and it's just trying to regrow it using the crystals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:41]** I don't... Sorry, is there something with the crystals?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:44]** I'm just... I was overhearing what Dr. O.K.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** was saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** What were they saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** You should ask Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:51]** Well, that's very helpful.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:51]** Thank you.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:52]** All right.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:52]** I'll ask them.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Super helpful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:54 - 00:52:00]** Anyway, basically, you can recall... Are you saying that they... Sorry, this is Kevin now.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** The egg...

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:08]** Was put outside and now there's a dragon or there was a dragon and egg?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:12]** She has a theory that when she came here, there was no dragon, but there was an egg.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:17]** So she birthed this dragon and now we have to deal with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:17]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** What?

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** She birthed the dragon.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** She put the egg outside.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** It hatched and now we're...

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** I guess that's what you would call it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:30]** Everyone in the chat is basically being like, this was a bad idea to put out the egg of the dragon.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:33]** And I agree with all those sentiments.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:33]** That was a bad idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:38]** Seems like not a good idea to put an egg outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:43]** At the time, I didn't know that it was a dragon egg per se.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** Again, I'm not the doctor.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** That's not what I've done before.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:50]** But I put it outside and then now I have heard about dragons.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:55]** And so I have a feeling that that's what's happening is that that dragon's trying to get back in.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:55]** Why?

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** I don't know.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:57]** I'm not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:00]** But what do you need from us about this?

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** Are you just like letting us know this is what's happening?

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:06]** Or do you need us to seal an entrance?

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** Or are you going to stay here for much longer?

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** It's interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:10]** Yeah.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** No, that's a good question.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:17]** I had told you just to tell you because you're here in our home and we're hosting you here.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:20]** And then suddenly, you know, this large rock falls.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:22]** It's quite scary.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:24]** I'm not trying to hide anything from you.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** I'm just trying to tell you.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:40]** But now that you say that, I... When you're up there, if there is anything that you see that could help out with the dragon, then keep an eye out for it, right?

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:53]** If you see the dragon, if you see any sort of anything around this area, I don't know if you saw anything when you were coming in, but if you see anything, then let us know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:58]** Did you happen to name the dragon at any point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:59 - 00:53:59]** No.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:01]** We should come up with a name from now.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** We should call him Stupid Face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:07]** I don't think Stupid Face is going to get us anywhere with the dragon gears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:10]** Well, then you genius, you come up with a name for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** What about Steven with a V?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:17]** No, that's very ill-boding.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:19]** I mean, we just saw what happened to that, Steven.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:23]** Yeah, that was Steven with an F. Another lame name, but we don't want to be mean to the dragon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:24]** Oh, okay.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:28]** Mirko just slowly walks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** She's like really bored with this conversation.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** I regret keeping her.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:31]** She's like, great.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:32]** All right, cool.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:33]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** No, if you could just keep...

**[00:54:36 - 00:55:03]** your eye out for something if there's a possible solution or try and understand what's going on again i don't want you to put yourselves in harm's way i have a feeling that fighting dragon or getting tangled up with one is not exactly in your plan or in anybody's plan but just can you provide some clarification was there any indication of a parent dragon when you found the egg

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:10]** Where did you find the egg and what was its surroundings?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** It was in some sort of a nest.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:17]** So yes, there might have been some sort of a parent, I guess.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:20]** But I don't know if... Apparently.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:25]** Right, but I don't know if the dragon up there... You're asking good questions, Rick.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:31]** I don't know if the dragon that's coming through there is the egg or the parent.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** I don't know.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:33]** And I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:35]** Are there more eggs?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** There is one egg.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:38]** You're asking a lot of questions.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** There is one egg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:42]** There are a lot of questions revolving around this dragon.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:42]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** I get it.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:44]** I get it.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:45]** Yeah.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** That's all that I know.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** There is one egg.

**[00:55:48 - 00:56:17]** I'm guessing that it's the parent that's my theory is that it's the parent of the egg because this was I'd say oh goodness we put that out when we came here so it's been quite some time and I don't know that they grow that fast to cause all of this I don't think it's just what did Rudy say about the dragon that it was a small dragon an adolescent


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:21]** He just literally said that there were lots of small dragons flying around.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:25]** Like smaller dragons in the sky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:29]** Do dragons... Do multiple dragons come from a single egg?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:30]** No.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:36]** It's usually like one dragon per egg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** How do you know that, John?

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:39]** Are you an expert on dragons or Starfinder dragons?

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** What are you... I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:44]** There's no double yolk eggs?

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:46]** Rick is very opinionated about dragons today.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:48]** Let's go over to Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:58]** Colin, you are working with Steven, and I do think in order to treat long-term care...

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:08]** You have enough from Lydia to set it up, but you won't have any bonuses or anything.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:17]** So I think it's pretty much just, you know, she has enough of a medical bay that she's able to bring through to set up a makeshift longterm.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:19]** It might mean a slightly higher DC.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:27]** Um, but otherwise I think you can set something up there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:28]** Okay.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** In the tent.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:36]** Yeah, let's try to do some long-term care with my buddy Steven over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** Do we want to do surgery?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:46]** Well, Dr. O'Kay, you're looking through and you think that, you think it might be possible.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:49]** You think you might be able to reattach the limb?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** Can we wake him up long enough to ask him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** If he wants the limb?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** Yeah.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:56]** I mean, is there a medical proxy present?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:02]** Does Steven have any loved ones?

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:04]** Who is the next of kin?

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:09]** They're on the plane of fire.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:12]** And I don't know what that code is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:18]** Let's roll a sanity check to see if he would probably want his leg back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:22]** I mean, I think that we're firmly in the like gorilla medicine.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:24]** Yeah.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:27]** We're in fucking tents and he just had a giant rock fall on his face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:31]** But we have nanites and we have this magic crystal powder.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** Right, you have a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** Magic crystal powder.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** We got magic crystal powder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** Dr. Ocasio-Cortez.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:41]** Yeah, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:44]** Dr. Ocasio-Cortez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:44 - 00:59:09]** he is the engineer and was formerly a groundskeeper so has a lot of knowledge about uh just natural events and occurrences and life cycles so um you know stephen stephen yeah so uh well he probably if he's right he probably wants his legs later if he doesn't want it all right i think we we go straight to surgery as best we can


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:12]** Let's get an OR set up somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:15]** Lydia, do you care to join us?

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:19]** Let's make sure we grab this limb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** We keep it on ice until we're ready to transplant.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:28]** How much ice is available on this lava?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:30]** Yeah, I was going to say, there's not that much ice there.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:32]** They're not working with a lot of ice.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** Finder just gave us zero.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:37]** So I like having Finder to help kind of like code GM a bit.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** Be like, yeah, there's none.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** So that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:41]** And he's very good with the visuals, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:43]** Very, very good with the visuals.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** So you're operating quickly.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:50]** I mean, it's only been a matter of 10, 15 minutes since this happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:50 - 01:00:18]** yeah okay we're good yeah you're good let's do it okay cool i like this so we've got like we've got a nice montage of like if it doesn't work out and he gets gang green we just sever it anyway and then apply the crystals and give them a robotic prosthetic and you know yeah exactly we tried to the thigh now because we tried i just want you to roll a natural one on the medicine check for the surgery so the leg is on backwards


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** Yeah, exactly.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:21]** We amputate the wrong leg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** Yeah, you're not looking.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:26]** It just splits easier, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:26]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** All right.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:38]** There is a montage of you all, the flaps on the tent shutting, and they all start to wait outside.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:41]** You see like sparks in shadows.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:48]** There's like all this noise as they are inside working.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:49]** Yeah.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:51]** I'm going to move Dr. Okay.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:55]** And where is Lydia Searstone?

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:55]** Here she is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:58]** Just coming along for emotional support.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:58 - 01:00:58]** Yeah, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:04]** Here's just whispers creepily in your ears while you're doing surgery.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:07]** Hey, they need to clear the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:13]** He thinks it's telepathic, but it's just out loud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:14]** Yeah.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** Nurse here is ready to do it.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:18]** Nurse Fabricius.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:22]** And then Rick is outside being jabbed in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:27]** We're going to have a whole Fabricius Barbie line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:46]** So I have two doctors nurse years and Rick 19 is the admin who's coming in saying that like I'm sorry if you're not family you Unless you want to lay down


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:48 - 01:02:06]** you're like to come off too and he's uh he's gonna call over to bernice uh to come back uh to assist yeah with some nanites i love this uh because i think that will aid in the reattachment because it is if anyone's done the research uh

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:15]** Reattaching a limb is a complicated procedure in which you need microsurgical attachments of individual pieces.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:19]** And if you have in the Discord, let us know.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:22]** Yeah, if you have, let us know where I get this wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:30]** I think that there are going to be... This is my thought.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:45]** that there's going to be one check at the end for long-term care, which can be aided in order to make sure that he's stable and can continue to recover.

**[01:02:48 - 01:03:00]** Before then, I think there's going to be one medicine check in order to set this up, to bring in the leg, prep it,

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:23]** and make the attachments right and add in the nanites and add in the red crystal then i think there's going to be one more medicine check that involves anything that depending on the first one anything that comes up afterwards the complications of the reattaching and making sure that it stays

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** Okay.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:31]** That's kind of my sense, because this is a pretty intensive thing that you're doing, as Benny said, guerrilla medicine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:33]** Go ahead and give me that first check.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:35]** Rick has a plus six on medicine.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:36]** Should he be involved as a nurse?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:38]** Yeah, I mean, you can help.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:40]** Yeah.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** Yeah, I think so.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:42]** Everyone should help who can help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:45]** Yeah, I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** So I think...

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:56]** I think we need to assess the damage of and whether or not this limb stump can be attached first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:58]** And then find the arteries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** Yep.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** That's your first check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:04]** Cool.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:07]** Dr. Okay, what's your medicine modifier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:09]** My medicine is plus 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** Okay.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** Plus 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:17]** Plus, I think if I'm using the lab, I should get a circumstance bonus, if I'm not mistaken.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:18]** Let me just double check.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:20]** Yeah, let's check the lab and see if you do.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:23]** I mean, it doesn't cover surgery in the rulebook.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:24]** That's the thing.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:31]** What that helped you with was to synthesize and get the crystal to a fine enough granule size.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:33]** But I have an advanced med kit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:53]** and that's does it obviously yeah does that help with it yeah this improvised surgery you can improvise most basic medical instruments allowing you to perform rudimentary surgeries without a medical care this is not a rudimentary surgery no advanced make it star finder


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:54 - 01:05:01]** Um, so you do have one of those, which to treat drugs, diseases, and set a one time.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:01]** Yes.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:03]** Good, good, good.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:03]** Yes.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:05]** So that is, that is what is allowing you.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:06]** Yeah.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:10]** It's a plus two insight bonus though, to medicine checks, to treat drugs, diseases, and poisons.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:12]** It's not quite to do the surgery.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:16]** Well, that's to set the DC is only 20, right?

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:23]** So that to me feels like part of what you could use to set up as part of the second check.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:27]** This is what allows you to have a...

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:52]** temporary medical lab right and along with what uh what do you call it lydia has yeah so i think with this this will lower your dc you have two people giving you aids right and this first check is to is to make sure that this is viable have you found the right arteries have you found the right tendons are you putting everything back in the right way all right i'm ready to roll okay give me your role dr okay and whoever else is rolling to aid let me know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:52 - 01:06:10]** all right rick aids you just can't 10 on the die plus 14. there's a 24 plus the circumstance but so we don't get the circumstance bonus for this one right it lowers your uh dc anyone 19. because i probably need to be 25. yeah colin colin automatically assists


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:12]** So 26?

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:15]** It's a 28, right?

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:16]** Because you rolled a 24?

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:17]** Yeah.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:18]** 26 plus 28.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:18]** Yeah.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:23]** Yeah, you are very confident that you have laid out the right tendons in the right way.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:26]** You can see where everything connects to be oriented correctly.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:31]** The bone fits together pretty clearly as a guidepost.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:31]** All right.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:32]** So that is a successful check.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:33]** All right, let's do this.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** You think you can do this.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:37]** You feel like this is well within the possibility.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:38]** Okay.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:42]** You got one more check to make sure that you do it successfully.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:44]** All right.

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:46]** Don't roll a one on this check.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** Can we eight again?

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:49]** 17.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:50]** Yeah.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:51]** 17.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:52]** Plus.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:52]** Total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:53]** No, no, no.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:54]** 14.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:55]** That's the naked roll.

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:58]** The naked roll.

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:00]** 17 plus.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:00]** What do we got?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:02]** Put some pants on, mate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:07]** 17 plus 14 medicine plus 31.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:14]** And then Rick 19, you, I provide, and I got the circumstance bonus, right?

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:14]** I assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:20]** No, because the circumstance is only for like drugs, diseases, or poisons.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:22]** I thought I got for this surgery.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:23]** All right.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:29]** No, it, it 35, it lowers your DC and Colin, you ate it, right?

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05
