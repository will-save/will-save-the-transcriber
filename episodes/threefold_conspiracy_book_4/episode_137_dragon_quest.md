## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:11]** Hello friends.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:31]** Wow, that was so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:34]** Kelly, thank you for screaming that.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** I finally, I felt the energy.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:38]** I feel like I'm ready to rock and roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:41]** I feel like I had to make it up somehow.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** I feel ready for the kumite.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** Not will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:46]** Feel ready for the kumite.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:52]** Feels like there's a crowd of thousands around us just watching, just cheering us on one day.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** They will.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** I got a question for you.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Thank you.

**[00:01:59 - 00:01:59]** Thank you.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** That's it.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:00]** That's it.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:01]** Appreciate y'all.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** I see you back there.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:03]** I see you.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** Yep.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:04]** Yep.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** You too.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:05]** You too.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:06]** Thanks dad.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:07]** Yep.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** It's good.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:08]** It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:17]** In this situation where I'm surrounded by thousands of applauding people, I'm going to pull a bill Murray and just go.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:21]** Just do a, just do the quick point.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** The quick finger gun.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:22]** Yeah.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:26]** Does it, does it play like bill Murray or does it play by like Toby McGuire?

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** That's the question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:29]** Is that what he does, too?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** Is that his signature move?

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:30]** Oh, God.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:31]** In Spider-Man 3?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** From Spider-Man 3.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:33]** Yeah.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:36]** I thought his signature move is he, like, ran over people with his car.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** I don't remember him, like, ever, like, pointing.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:38]** What?

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:41]** That seems like something difficult to repeat.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** Is that something that happened?

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:42]** A vehicle?

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** Is that a thing?

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Yeah, that's what he does.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** He hates crowds.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:50]** This is the thing for a guy that I complain can't act on the road.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** He definitely shows emotion.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** Tobey Maguire, yeah.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:56]** He's well known for being a rage monster.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** He doesn't like people.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** He doesn't like fans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** He just murders them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** He doesn't like fans.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** No.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** There was something.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** He has no fans in his home.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** No ceiling fans, no Bucks fans, nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** It's too intense.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** No, it's too much.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** His computer is always running hot.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** So he wasn't?

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** Yeah, he only has MacBook Airs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:22]** Was it Spider-Man 2 when he was goth?

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:22]** Spider-Man?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:26]** Okay, three.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** So that's him always?

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** Like he wasn't even acting?

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:31]** That's always him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:34]** That's the only part I liked about him.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:38]** I feel like that's probably... Wait a minute!

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** This is a new development.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** Because he showed emotion.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:45]** He showed emotion-ish for the first time ever.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** And I was like, alright, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:50]** I'm just upset at him for never giving the girl across the hall time of day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** That's true.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:52]** Right?

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:52]** I know.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** That's a storyline.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** I wish it went somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:57]** Who shows less emotion on film?

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** Tobey Maguire or Kristen Stewart?

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** That's a good question.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:01]** Kristen Stewart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:03]** I didn't watch What's It Called?

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** Probably Kristen Stewart.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Madame White.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:10]** But that entire movie is supposedly not good, right?

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** The series of movies with the vampires.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** What's it called again?

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** Twilight.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** I haven't seen it, to be fair.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Twilight.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:16]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:32]** Kelly, can I just... I don't want to skip over the fact that, to be clear, your tastes around who is a good actor is like the inverse of what everybody else agrees, which is that Tobey Maguire is okay, except for the emo scene in Spider-Man 3 in which...

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** he is not great at all.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** But instead, you're like the opposite.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:38]** You're like, no, none of it is good except for the emo scene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:43]** To Vin Kelly's perspective on this, he's not saying the movie is good because of that.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:48]** He's saying that that scene is the only scene that Tobey Maguire's ever showed emotion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:51]** I feel like that's not... So he's not saying it defends the movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** What about Pleasantville?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** Dude, Pleasantville's great.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** I love Pleasantville.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** Oh, Pleasantville.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** Wasn't he also in Seabiscuit?

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** Yeah.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** He was.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** Yeah, he was.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** That's the main movie where he didn't act.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** It's all about the horse.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** He was Seabiscuit.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** He was Seabiscuit.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** He was the voice of Seabiscuit.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** Oh, he was that good where he just ended up being the horse as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** And that's... Oh, my bad, Toby.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:13]** That's what you don't realize, Kelly, is that... Okay, I'm sorry.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** That's his rage.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** The horse had a very emotional role.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:16]** That's his rage.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** And he ended up being the...

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:40]** if an actress who can disappear into their role like that are pretty great like it's gary oldman i guess and then apparently toby mcguire so toby mcguire he can be a horse and probably a chair in spider-man and i didn't know and he could see colors for the first time i had no idea this entire thing yes yes exactly in a world of black and white yeah what is that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:40 - 00:06:08]** it's a great movie all right yeah it's worth it he's probably fine in that i have a question great cat spears that's a banter topic from crowd in so i want to get to it thank you yeah right yeah awesome nice okay thank you it's game night and everyone is at the table but your dm isn't ready what is your backup plan terraforming terraforming i've started playing this new game parks oh

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Which is cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** I think it was at Gen Con.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:11]** Yeah.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** Um... Yeah, Parks is dope.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:16]** So you're saying, like, pull out a board game that's not... Yeah.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** Doesn't require... Or any game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:21]** Actually, preferably, like, the longest game you can.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:24]** So, like, Terraforming Mars with all the expansions at once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:27]** And so... That takes six days to play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:30]** Yeah, it takes a long time to play.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** No.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** Or just wait.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:33]** Make a snack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:34]** I don't know.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:35]** Right.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** Go make tacos.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:39]** How much runway does the GM need?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:49]** I wish we could... I mean, should I at Cardamon right now on our support channel and be like, hey... Is it like they show up and they're like, oh, sorry, I'm running late.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** I need an extra 30?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:58]** Or is it like, hey, let me do two hours of planning real quick to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:13]** um really make this session worthwhile otherwise i don't know if you could have predicted this because i think if we put the players need more context to your hypothetical


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:20]** Because I would say if the GM doesn't show up and everybody else is at the table, that's concerning, especially John.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:26]** If John didn't show up, because he's always on an hour before and he's like, just don't look at me, I'm prepping.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:29]** If he wasn't doing that, then...

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:31]** Then I'd be really worried that there was something wrong.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:34]** Like, has anybody heard from John in the last 25 minutes?

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** Because I think he might be dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:38]** I'm just channeling my inner Tobey Maguire from the best scene ever.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:38]** I know.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** From the best ever.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** Don't look at me.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** Bring out the search and rescue.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:43]** We got to go save him.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** Don't look at me at all.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:47]** I'm going to put my hair down and wear my hair down on my face.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** This is my Tobey Maguire episode.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** I have my hair on my face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** You also need to know if it's in person.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** And if so, is it at...

**[00:07:54 - 00:08:16]** gm's house or place of residence if everybody shows up to the house and like nobody's there yeah and he's like all right guys just make yourselves comfortable in the living room for a minute while i spend two hours and then he comes out and you're like wait whoa this is the wrong game they start breaking out the whips and chains and handcuffs yeah how long is the master

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:20]** Is the DM in the house?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:26]** What type of DM is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:29]** It's a weekend game or is it like a Tuesday night?

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** I like a good morning game too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:32]** When things like this happen in real life, I always go back to sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:39]** If it were a morning game and John was like, guys, I actually overslept.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** Not eggs.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** Not freaking eggs.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:26]** That's for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** Lauren made vegan eggs the other day.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** They were just made of tofu.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:31]** They were like scrubs and scrubs.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:31]** No, no, no.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** Have you ever had that vegan cheese?

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** It's the worst thing ever.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** Yeah, cashew cheese.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:35]** Cashew cheese is good.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** I'm so sorry.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:40]** Unfortunately, this is another group of people or lifestyles that we might have to.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:40]** I don't know if it's still there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:49]** I don't have a problem with good vegan food, but I don't like it when vegan food pretends to be real food.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:49]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:51]** I have an update, and I agree with you, Will.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** DM isn't or can't perform.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** Either you save the day or everyone goes home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** You play something else.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:23]** What's happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** Are you gray?

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:25]** Are you the gray one?

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:30]** For me, personally, I would want to do a LAN party.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** Bring back the old-fashioned party.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** This is the thing.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:43]** If we do this in person, I want you all to have your CRT monitors and towers just as backups, just on the off chance that John's not here.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** What are we playing, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:49]** John's going to, like, next time we go to play, John's going to purposely play Halo on PC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** Because that's the master race.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:51]** You can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** You can do it.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:57]** Which, ironically, I don't think that would work as a Master Race thing.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:59]** It's kind of weird to play it on the PC, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:04]** I like playing modded games on PC in a LAN party.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:08]** I used to play Action Quake 2

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:15]** which was a mod for Quake 2, which was like a predecessor for Counter-Strike, which was a mod for Half-Life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** What's the mod?

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:17]** Like, what are you modding?

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** What don't you mod?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** What's the action part of Quake?

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** Quake is classic.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:25]** I think Quake 3 was what Venny, Daniel, and I played a bunch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** Age of Empires.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:29]** Age of Empires.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:32]** Yeah, Age of Empires.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:35]** What was the ultimate tournament?

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Action shooter.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** It was, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:38 - 00:14:00]** unreal sorry that's unreal online was great yeah it was wild unreal tournament was fun yeah speaking of an unreal moment how do you guys feel about when you're driving through the landscape of eros there's some red eyes in the distance quite the unreal moment crank up the ramps


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:02]** Put the metal to the metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** Message Cryo Demon again.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** How big are these red eyes?

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** How far away do they seem?

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** Cryo Demon is not in charge of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** Oh, okay.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:13]** Thank you, Cryo Demon.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** I hope we answered your question.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** I know we didn't.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** Shout out to Cryo Demon for being awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** And I do have a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:47]** sentence a writing sentence that i'm going to okay i rolled to see which one is gonna be and i have i'm gonna roll to see which one of you it's gonna be which one of you guys which one of you guys oh i grabbed the wrong dice for that but while we're doing this i want you to think about what your characters uh

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:50]** they might be thinking in this moment.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** I'm going to go through and go into Discord.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:56]** Let's use diplomacy.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** And message that person.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** That person has been messaged.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** Let's get into the F137.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:21]** Last week, you all bowed farewell to one of the few, if not maybe one of the first relaxing locations that the four of you have spent time in.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** Maybe the Voidcrier when you first got on.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** Maybe.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Before you went to sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:27]** Except for the baby dragon part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** Baby dragon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:38]** The hospitality of the Aesirs seemingly rejuvenated

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:44]** Y'all giving you like a safe space to lay your head, some new equipment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:47]** Which, by the way, we retcon for anyone.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:52]** We exercise some lemon laws behind the scenes.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** We did.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** We'll introduce the weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:55]** Not me.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** I took them.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:57]** I took it as is.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** But we saved a leg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:02]** You also got the opportunity to help others.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:03]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** Save a leg.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** And also some home-cooked meals, right?

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:19]** Because the Aesir's home, as you discovered, was once a site that Ringworks was mining for unusual minerals and materials in the crust of Varos at this location that they called Aeon Star No.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:19]** 6.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** They didn't find anything.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:46]** Really, except for a little bit about the rocks, but they didn't find any gems or anything, but then the tragedy that occurred from their efforts, when the workers revolted against the ring works, oppressive practices led to then the growth of this red crystal, sort of a Memorial of sorts, perhaps to what it took to bring this crystal to the surface.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:50]** And while you were there, you did find a new threat.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:52]** that came right to your doorstep.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:54]** Dragons.

**[00:16:54 - 00:17:06]** a cave-in possibly caused by dragons overhead, seeking to come into what may be their home, led to a severe injury in the camp from Stephen.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:11]** And as you found out, this red crystal has healing properties that Dr. O.K.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:22]** and Colin and Dr. Lydia Searstone used to restore full mobility in a field operation that was miraculously successful.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:43]** incredible as you reattached his severed leg pretty freaking cool so then you leave with all the acolytes and the thanks and the support of your friends at corundum the name that they've given this mine saying goodbye to your new friends and the android abolitionist friends friends

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:49]** And you were told if you see anything that can help with these dragons, let us know.

**[00:17:50 - 00:18:08]** So lo and behold, you are heading across the Varos landscape when in the steamy air of a small volcano canyon, there's a pair of red eyes floating in front and above you.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:12]** I'm going to bring you guys to the map.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** I put your cars on here.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:18]** I think they're HP, as they should be.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** The Stoosers.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** The Stoosers.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** And you see these red eyes.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:42]** And as the heat from the hot volcanic air seems to finish waving and part some of the steam and the obfuscation, then this snout slowly appears.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:44]** That's very, very long.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:57]** I'm going to reveal in front of you and it begins to slowly reveal this large beast standing on a rock in front of you.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:00]** I'm going to show you guys the artwork.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:05]** He looks not friendly, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Oh.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** How big did you say he was?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** It's a dragon, by the way.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** Spoiler alert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:17]** If you're not paying any attention, it's a dragon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:36]** you all are in your cars it doesn't look red bro i mean it's red just like uh it's just like a faction essentially or like you couldn't find like a red it's like a chocolate it's a chalky red it's okay the chalk is it yeah it's got lots of black spikes but it's like the skin is chalky white and red and then it's silver horns yeah yeah long horns and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:36 - 00:20:00]** kind of mean looking face to be honest and then the wings have nice like protruding claws at the the fold i don't know what did you call the part where the wing is like i don't know is it yeah he's a very spiky dragon for sure super spiky you all are maybe like that i don't know what 40 50 feet away in the cars i'm assuming you've slowed down we're on a separate map too oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:18]** there is you feel this like roar that shakes the car thank you sirenscape for making this very creepy

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** Thank you, Sirenscape.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** Oh, man.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** Is Sirenscape stereo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** Because it just growled in one ear, not the other.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:28]** Oh, it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** He's to our left.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:30]** Yeah.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** Right in our ears.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:32]** Yeah.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** I hope it's... I had enough dragon Gs.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:36]** It's creepy.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:38]** I can feel its dragon breath around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:40]** Yeah, just... Yeah.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:44]** It flies with one giant flap.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:51]** Yeah, it swoops down and just digs its claws into the ground.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** The ground cracks.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** And then you hear this voice.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:01]** Maybe roll down the window a little bit.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:07]** It takes a few steps forwards and says...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:17]** I've watched you handle yourselves.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:45]** cross this waste better than most who perish under its heat another step forward why are you here another step why do you have these vehicles what do you all do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:49]** Is this in our head or is this verbal?

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** This is verbal.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** This is verbal, but it's loud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:54]** Can we communicate in our head before we respond?

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:59]** Because I feel like... Yeah.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** I don't want to tee him off.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:26]** don't suppose i think it's on the truth yeah yeah because i i'm not sure there's anything he's going to be mad about about that we don't know over here he's a reptoid as well we are seeking to leave what do you say what do you do that's that's my vote what was that uh we were brought here against our will and we are seeking to leave


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:32]** Is it possible that this dragon may have some kind of insight on the Reptoid takeover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:34]** If he's got insight, he's not likely giving it to us.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:37]** I mean, he's kind of... You never know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:39]** We could sway this dragon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:44]** Rick says out loud, like, we had to escape from... John gives the most skeptical look ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Hey, man.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** Anything's possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:48]** Oh, what's the name of the base that we escaped from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** Tecalis.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:55]** Yeah, I mean, I just say we were brought here against our will, and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:19]** we're seeking to leave but rick rick will say like to follow that he'll be like we we had to escape from tercalis before they exploded and now we are heading to terrapin station we're just trying to get off the planet yeah we we really we don't like i assume tercalis really mired your lovely scales there um we're glad it's gone too

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:23]** We don't know anything about the mind back there with Azur's.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** That's not... Hush.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** I hate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** As did we.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:33]** That was us.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** We blew it up.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** We did that.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:40]** That's why you have these nickels.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:40]** That's right.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:45]** We were in a very anti-Tircalis mood.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** Thanks, you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** Oh, is that your name?

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:52]** For destroying that blasted place.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:57]** Yes, I am Varictius, and you are in my land.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:01]** Well, Here's is my name.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:05]** Here's thanks you for your thanks, and thanks you for being a good host.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:09]** We were just hoping to cut through here so we can get off.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:14]** and stay away as far away from whatever's left of your callus as we can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:21]** I do not know what you have experienced of our kind.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:27]** I am true to my nature.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:33]** If I had wanted you gone, I would have already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:37]** I come seeking help.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** Oh.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** What you need, bud?

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** Are y'all just in the cars?

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** I mean, the window's down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:49]** You turn the car around and just roll down the window.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:51]** Yeah, of course that's manual.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:53]** The stewards are not going to pay for automatic.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:56]** Hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** It's stuck, sorry.

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:59]** Not on this budget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:06]** Given the condition of Colin and Rick's car, they have to, like, push it down manually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:10]** Yeah, they... We don't have creases on our car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:13]** Are you kidding me?

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** Rick sighs and rolls her eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:18]** It is not often...

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:27]** that I see capable small ones, such as yourselves, who have taken down Tercalus.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:31]** But like I said, I am impressed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:32]** Whoa.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:35]** You're an impressive guy, so that means a lot.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** An impressive woman.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** Correction, she isn't she.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** I've been thinking of her he this entire time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:44]** Sorry, I'm not...

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** Let me do a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:50]** I'm assuming this is a sexist to assume a dragon is a key.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:52]** Do you want to do a life science check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** I mean, I mean just like observation.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** I'm not going to like, yeah, of course.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:58]** Yeah, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:01]** Uh, here's also is adding him to his like Pokedex kind of thing.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:03]** 24 per side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:03]** 24.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** Don't want to.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:34]** life science yeah you are certain that this is a female relatively female young about to be yeah sorry a female relatively mid to like young ish but like about to cross that threshold which is why she is just at the end like tail end of large she is larger than your vehicle yeah she is larger than your vehicle for sure


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:41]** Many moons ago, I left my home taunt.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:44]** And when I came back,

**[00:26:46 - 00:27:06]** My egg was on the Varus surface and entering into a vehicle much like yours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** Well, that wasn't us.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** Of course, it was not you.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:14]** It was Noden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:22]** Oh, that... I could go on for ages about that.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:28]** We try not to use bad words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** We don't like Dr. Nodens either.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:32]** She kind of screwed us too.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:36]** Yeah, Nodens is the worst, so any enemy of Nodens is a friend of ours.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** We didn't mind killing her.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** She smelled funny, too.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** She is.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** I think we killed her, by the way.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:45]** A despicable creature.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:45]** Was.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** Was a despicable creature.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** She's dead.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:48]** Possibly was.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:48]** Just saying.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:50]** We did blow up Tearkalis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** Where are you headed?

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:58]** Terrapin.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** Do you think it's there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:04]** We saw a ship fly overhead from Tarkalis towards Terrapin, and we were tracking that.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Do we know she's dead?

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:08]** I saw the ship.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:09]** We don't know for sure, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** I have seen it before.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:15]** It is always the tidings of the evil stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:24]** Just to clarify, the stewards that we ran into, it was revealed to us that they are possibly Reptoids, and they may not be stewards.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** Yeah.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** You've heard of Reptoids, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** Further cause.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Yeah.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:34]** For our shared interest.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:34]** Agreed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:35]** In their destruction.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:37]** Love it.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:41]** Also, how do you pronounce your name again?

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** Varignias?

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** Varignias.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** Varignias.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:49]** Could you please elaborate on the bad things about Nodens that you're aware of?

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** I mean, we know some stuff.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** She stole the egg, man.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:54]** Besides taking your egg, what else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:57]** I do not have time to go in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Yeah, she's that bad.

**[00:28:59 - 00:28:59]** I know.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** We could go on forever.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** She has stolen my offspring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** There is nothing.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:12]** and such an act, taking them from my care.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** Do any of you recall seeing an egg at Turcalis?

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Possibly in that storage room?

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:19]** The other cargo bay?

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** No, the other cargo bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:32]** No, I'm checking the notes that Kevin did and there's nothing past episode 136 or five about that, so nothing.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** And we trust Kevin's notes.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:49]** the uh all right so we're gonna go to uh we're trying to get to terrapin if she's still alive that's probably where she is if you want to help an exact vengeance upon her return my egg


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:55]** Isn't this the same thing that happened to us in our D&D game?

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:57]** It was something about tracing the egg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** And I will reward you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** This sounds like a classic quest.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** I'm down.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:08]** I mean, you could, yeah, Virignus, you could help us with it.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:13]** I feel like, don't you want to make sure that you're offering some help?

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:17]** Yeah, but for Igneous, I mean, it would be helpful to have you help.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:19]** And it is your kid, and you're a giant dragon.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** I mean, we're small ones.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** If you could just pick up our cars.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** You know, we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** We don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** And we will shoot at people as we fly over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:28]** Or drop us off at Terrapin.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** You know.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** Yeah, could you just drop us off there?

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** Maybe, like, melt a door or something.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:33]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:35]** If you want.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** Hashtag teamwork.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:42]** Hashtag teamwork.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** How do you get in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** This is not my concern.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:47]** Okay.

**[00:30:48 - 00:31:03]** Okay, this is not... If I can ask a question, and I hope it's not rude, why would you send us instead of going and getting the egg yourself?

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** You seem well-equipped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:08]** It's a good question.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:21]** There are many tests that I must perform as ruler of this land, but I have tried before, and I loathe Ticalis and Terrapin.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** Okay.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:37]** It is named after a despised ancestor for them to choose these names, and despite my many attacks, both on Ticalis and Terrapin and my forefathers,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:39 - 00:32:03]** proven unsuccessful okay i will continue to sit down on my ass here to help oh we're here now we'll try but can you give us some tips about terrapin and did you say they were the names of your ancestors but like bad ancestors they are foul betrayers of our own


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:05]** I see.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:08]** Tell me a bit more about that, if you don't mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:12]** I do mind.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:24]** When you approach Terrapin, there is one who walks with a foul, despicable being.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:34]** That is blasphemous to all living things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:38]** Does a blasphemer got a name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** No, it is their own.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:49]** There is only one way in, but I have seen something attached to that entrance.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:53]** So beware and be cautious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:57]** Can you, uh, which entrance is it?

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Is there just one?

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** There's just the one entrance?

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** There is the starship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:05]** Those foul machines.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** the power that we dragons have.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:09]** Truly.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:10]** I would not.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:11]** Preach.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:22]** I would not recommend entering there, for even its doors withstand my own fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** And there's like smoke that comes out of her mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Yes, Rick, you have a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** Oh, well, Kevin has a question.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:31]** Like, do we know... Somebody did a live channel.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:34]** Like, do we know how old this dragon is?

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:37]** You said it was, like... Like, is it a number of years?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:42]** It's, like, adolescent about to be, like, prime, middle.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:45]** Well, I know, but, like...

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:48]** So, like, how long is that on Varos?

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:51]** Oh, in terms of how old they are?

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** In terms of how old dragons are?

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** Oh, man.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** That's a really good question.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:56]** Is it years?

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:57]** Months?

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Years.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:58]** Decades?

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:08]** You can tell that without a life science that this dragon, Virignus, she has sired many broods, let's say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:11]** And this is one of her latest.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** She's for the streets.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** So, Rick is going... Sagan?

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** She's for the streets?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:18]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:23]** I was not talking about that at all.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** Rick 19.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** What is your question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:31]** You say that you hate the Reptoids, and that's completely understandable.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** I hate the stewards.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** Well, that's my question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:39]** Are you a steward of the Reptoid nature?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:45]** Well, my question to you is, have they always been Reptoids, or have you witnessed a change in your time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** I do not know.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:49]** And I do not care.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** She's out here, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:51]** She's ruined her kingdom.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:52]** It's all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:56]** Her kingdom is a canyon with nothing in it.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:01]** You ain't got shit to distract you.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:03]** You didn't do shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:12]** You would remember that you would think without a wisdom check, because I'm just going to put you in your place in this way with the dragon.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:19]** The former home of Corundum is quite likely where one of the places that she has inhabited.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:23]** So her area is like quite large.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** You would know that she is old enough.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:26]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:28]** It's not just this little canyon.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:33]** She rules hundreds of miles of territory that she hunts and stays on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:35]** Get another fold in this conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** I mean, it's not a fold.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** It's just a wrinkle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:39]** What is a wrinkle?

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:42]** She's also not the baby dragon we thought she was.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** She's the mother.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** No, she's the baby mama.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** She's the baby mama.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:47]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:50]** For the streets, apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:53]** Yeah, for the streets and rules over a tiny little canyon.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** Yeah, I forgot about that.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:54]** These aren't streets.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:58]** She's for the long flows.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** We're on Mustafa.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:06]** She begins to step back and says, I must go and be more useless over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Sorry.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:11]** She's got stuff to do.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** What does she have to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:15]** John put so much prep into this.


## Speaker_0

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** I'm so disappointed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:23]** She's got to make sure nobody else is stepping on her turf, man.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:24]** Yeah, buddy.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** She works in this corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:27]** So it's a GTA mission.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:30]** She's standing on the corner of her own little part of the city.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:32]** In the streets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:34]** Don't worry about it.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** Don't worry about it, sweetheart.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:45]** She begins to step away and says, I will find you when you return to my land.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** No problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** All right.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** Begins to fly away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:55 - 00:37:19]** she only didn't burn here's because it wasn't here so we go to terrapin we look for an egg we put it outside and we bounce take it out of the car and you found on the ground easy easy peasy it's an easy like 50 gold you know what i'm saying it's easy wait was that a reward no we didn't even get that far she flew off before i could ask


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:22]** No, she said that she would reward you if you came back.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** Handsomely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** And dragons like gold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:31]** Oh, also, in Duval and Dragons, in Foundry, her kingdom is called Somewhere on Varos.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** Just letting you all know.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** Where did you see that?

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** Yes, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** It says that somewhere on Varos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** It's the name of the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** Meanwhile, somewhere on Varos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** Yeah, that's the name of the map, bro.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** Are you kidding?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** I know, I know, I'm just saying.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:51]** Everyone, welcome to Kelly's first episode with, we'll say, first time playing Boundary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:56]** As far as quest givers go, what's the name of your least impressive quest giver?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** For sure.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** So what do you do now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** Do you all keep going?

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Yeah.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:07]** We're going to keep going on the one road we're on back to Tirgalis.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** We're on back to Tirgalis.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** We click on the quest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:15]** Yeah, you have to activate the quest first.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:25]** So she did tell you that there is an individual and some sort of reptoid beast thing that are outside of Tirrapin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:28]** So we go up to the ridge and we scout it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** Wait, can we pause on that?

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:40]** So, like, Reptoids are a humanoid, like, medium-sized creature that can change into other things that they have seen.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:43]** So they can't turn into random beasts.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:44]** So it's not a Reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:46]** She's like a beast rider.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:49]** Or it's like... Oh, it's a reptoid riding a beast?

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:50]** Yeah.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** That's what he... That's what she said.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:54]** What sort of beast is it?

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:56]** She didn't say, man.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** We could do a life science check when we get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:59]** I thought they were saying it was a reptoid beast.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** That the beast was a reptoid.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:02]** You're saying it's a beast with a reptoid on it.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** John, can you clarify this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:10]** She said there's an individual and there's a reptoid beast that is blasphemous to... Their kind.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** To dragon kind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** The living.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:13]** To dragon kind and the living.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:16]** Yeah, so it's probably like some undead beast.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** Reptoid.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:20]** Aoxian beast.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:25]** Can we do any kind of check on that to see, like, if we just know, like, oh, yeah, Reptoid.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** Well, I guess we wouldn't know if Reptoids.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** It doesn't matter.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** Rick doesn't matter.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** Rick doesn't, can't roll.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** Rick doesn't matter.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:33]** Rick doesn't matter.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** No.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** Yeah.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** I'll shoot.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:35]** So this is a side quest.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:36]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:36]** Yeah.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:39]** Well, also, it's one of those side quests that aligns with the prime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:41]** It furthers the goal of us getting to Turcalis.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** No, I know.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** Or, sorry, Terrapin.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** Terrapin.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:47]** I'm just impressed that the dragon didn't get mixed up.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** You need to go to Roseline.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** Yeah, we got to go to Rose Light.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:54]** But Terrapin is first on the checklist.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:57]** Terrapin is guarded by an individual and a beast.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Is it two different things?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** She said an individual and a reptoid beast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** Yeah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:05]** So you would think two different things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** Two entities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Two entities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:15]** Guard the entry lands to Terrapin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:21]** So let's go to the ridge, scout it, see if we can see this asshole, and then take care of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:22]** Yep.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** And then take care of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** Take care of them.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:29]** And then grab the egg, say... For the Widow Dragoon.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** Say thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** Thanks, Dragoon.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Thanks, friend.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** We're gonna get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:38]** You want us to blow up this base on the way out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** It's scary.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** Let's do it.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:48]** So you all just... You put in your cool books on tape or whatever you're listening to.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:51]** I hit G and I scroll over and I click it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** The first book of Harry Potter.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:53]** Kevin's reading it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** Line four.

**[00:40:56 - 00:41:01]** Harry lived with the Dursleys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** There was a house...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** He lived in the closet under the stairs.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:08]** So you all start driving across.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:18]** If you remember from last time, the way that your Stoosers were moving across the landscape was slowly upwards as you were moving into a larger crater.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:43]** i and it's not far after that valley that you yeah can we really start to come into the crater up the the valley to kind of get like a a high point dr here's gonna say like i think yeah sure given that uh we should scout out the area perhaps before we enter the immediate area of terrapin what do you guys think oh that's a good idea


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Always down for being smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:52]** So do we do the north ridge or is there a ridge to the south?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:53 - 00:42:06]** Yeah, there's, you see that the diameter of the crater at the other end is likely where Terrapin is on the other side of that crater.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:13]** So you could stay along the rim and try and move to the south and come in from the south or from the north.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:23]** There's a lava river on the other side of Terrapin, and there are two large like lava lakes to the west and south.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:29]** But with the time and the speed that you're moving, you can choose whichever way you want to come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** What's the effective range of our communications between these cars?

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** It's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:37]** Probably as much as for the police cruisers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** You thinking of splitting up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:44]** Well, we could take one north, one south, and see if we see them meet in the middle.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** Coordinate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** I don't see why there's any reason why.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:51]** Splitting the parties never bitten us in the ass.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** It has a planetary comm unit.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** No, we're not doing that.

**[00:42:54 - 00:43:00]** But the thing is, you know that if you wanted to send anything off comms, it's going to go through Terrapin.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:05]** So if you're just sending it to yourselves, then that's acceptable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** I still have the jammer on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:11]** So you can't even talk between the cars.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:39]** so that's why we put those down and we're just yeah i mean maybe we don't split and we just go north ridge and then if that if there's nothing there then maybe we try to cross the river if there's an ability and then circle to the south i don't know you remember from what she was saying that there is where's the entrance that we should use


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:53]** Yeah, from what she was saying, it sounds like the aircraft entrance, or the starship entrance, is on the west, and there is like a... It's not on the map here, but there is some lava there, and it looks like it's built into the rock.

**[00:43:53 - 00:44:01]** So it's like Terrapin is almost in the rock, and the entrances for the starship looks almost just like the crater itself.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:07]** And then you have to go over the top of the crater, and then you are actually at the...

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:17]** entrance to terrapin and that is around the east and south side okay so let's just head south yeah i think the south bridge might be the move okay

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:38]** moving you guys on the map what are you all thinking as you are actually starting to approach did you want to stop at like a nearby ridge and try and scout out yeah i think that's the move okay i'm gonna put you guys like pretty much the square next to it

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** but you're following the crater.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:55]** Anything that you're thinking as you're driving, as you're finally getting to Terrapin after leaving to your cows, to cows blowing up, crossing a river, trying to hang out with a bunch of lava striders, the monitoring site, the mine, the cliffs,

**[00:44:55 - 00:45:01]** you're actually coming to Terrapin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** Rick's just checking all of his equipment.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:06]** He's prepping for a mission is what it is.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:11]** They know they're going to get into combat and they're going to have to shoot it out.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:15]** So he's checking his batteries and he's strapping everything in tight.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:15]** Topping off.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** Checking his gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:17]** Yeah.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Cool.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** Standing on business.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:19]** All business.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** Okay.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:23]** It's business.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** It's business time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** Alrighty.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:32]** You come up and look on the ridge.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** Maybe you guys like crawl up to the ridge.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** Get out of the cars.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:46]** You see before you, coming from the south, you see that there is a very

**[00:45:48 - 00:46:07]** brutalist concrete bunker it's quiet for a moment and you can just make out how the smooth concrete stands up against the row of small hills that make the crater

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:13]** There's burnt igneous rock that sits next to it, tumbled boulders.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:18]** But the further you look, just the darker the concrete seems to be.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:21]** And occasionally there's steel supporting a roof beam.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:25]** But even that feels gray, cold.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** You wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:31]** So you're saying this is brutalist architecture?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** It's brutalist architecture.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:42]** You're maybe, you're far enough away that they wouldn't see you unless you were like really stood up and like set off a flare and try to do stuff.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** But you wait maybe.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** Yeah.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:45]** Yeah.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:45]** Yeah.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:49]** You wait maybe 15 minutes.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Don't see anything.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:51]** 20.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Don't see anyone.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** 25.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** Nothing.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** 30.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:03]** You wait a little longer and then around the corner you see what looks like a

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:14]** An elf, a female elf, walking confidently in a steward's outfit.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:16]** Eyes are alert.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:22]** a little slow and controlled, but alert.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:41]** And next to it is, as you look with your binoculars, you see these two orange eyes and this creature that moves awkwardly and unnaturally as if it's not meant to move this way.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:43]** It's an abomination.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:56]** It's two long front arms seem to pull it forward and two legs out from the back that stick out like a frog, but the legs are up.

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:00]** So it crawls and steps.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:07]** It reminds you almost of something that's bipedal, but is now quadrupedal.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:07]** Is that the right word?

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:12]** And you can see two orange angry eyes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** Do we know that they're angry?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:15]** Color.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** It's color.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:22]** It's some color to the language because it looks angry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:27]** Can I do an identified creature?

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:35]** And I'll also have Bernice assist with her internal database.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** How far away are we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:42]** I want to say you're probably at least...

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:47]** 1,000, 2,000 feet is what I'm thinking.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:57]** Yeah, but I mean, like... You're far enough to be able to zoom in and see pretty well, obviously, to get more data to see some of the finer things.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:57]** It's there.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:03]** But one thing that you'll see, Dr. Okay, before you give me the results of that roll...

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:26]** that there's a light on on that south side there's a light and occasionally as the pair are walking they'll walk up push something and then walk back and maybe while you're like working through this with Bernice more time passes there they're waiting around that area around the entrance area


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:46]** like a it's like a sensor to disable whatever countermeasure probably or something some sort of veronius did mention that there was something at the entrance uh what are the results uh i'm bad at math i got well just let me add it this is life science


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:46 - 00:50:07]** yeah but i used bernice so i got a 13 on my roll plus five from bernice plus my skill in life science is 16 18 18 so that's what 36 yeah okay without knowing like exactly the name of the creature you are fairly confident that this is a

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:15]** It is a genetically engineered, because I'm going to give you that plus two, too.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:20]** It is a genetically engineered, highly aggressive reptoid creature.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:33]** You think that this thing is both humanoid and quadrupedal and bird-like.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:38]** You get a minus five to anything with genetic life science.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:38]** Yeah.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:43]** So to the DC, it's crawling on all fours.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:51]** And you think this, like the skin color, remember that you haven't seen a reptoid yet.

**[00:50:53 - 00:51:11]** So to see this bird, four-legged creature that looks like it should have been bipedal and was originally bipedal, and then has somehow been genetically engineered to walk on four legs.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:14]** You look at the way that the feet move.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:17]** They look like they used to be hands and feet.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** You look like...

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:24]** The head, it looks like the structure of the muscles are to support something that is bipedal.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:29]** But the head is like this bird almost with this incredibly sharp beak.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:31]** And there are these talons that have come out of the hands.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:36]** And the green scaly skin is both smooth.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:45]** It's both like humanoid skin, reptoid skin, and like feathery at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:49]** Is it shifting or it's just like a weird mutation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:53]** It's a genetically modified beast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:53]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:56]** So it's not like it's phase shifting or anything into those different things.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:59]** It's consistent.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** It's a hibunculus or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:25]** oh it's just a it's a dog girl and an elf yeah it's a dog girl bird you don't know you would you would have to sequence its dna to find out more about like like what it is but you are certain that this thing is engineered to have incredibly strong exterior like talons and and from the way it looks dr okay you think that this thing has some sort of like field around it

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:30]** It seems like it can affect things that are not immediately near it.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** And you'll see occasionally.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:36]** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:36]** So what do you want to do?

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:39]** You're on the south ridge looking at this pair.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:42]** 30 minutes past roughly where they were not there.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:46]** Then they've been standing there now for the past 15, 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:50]** Is there anything down there that we were able to get closer to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:55]** Sorry, those are two crimes at the same time.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:55]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:55 - 00:53:01]** Yeah, is there any objects or anything that we can get closer and still keep ourselves hidden?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:07]** Yeah, there are boulders that you could get closer to and stay hidden.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:11]** And I wouldn't require you to roll a self-check.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** I say we move it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:15]** Yeah, I mean, probably don't take the cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:16]** Agreed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:41]** okay uh unless we can safely navigate like a ditch near to get closer but like i mean what time is it well you all left uh in the morning ish time and then you did repairs on the vehicles right so that was let's call it you were leaving around it's probably early

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** I'd say it's starting to get to be late afternoon.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:49]** Not quite dusk, but with the time that it took to repair the vehicles, I think it's been two hours.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:53]** Then to travel, it was probably another two or three hours.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** So you're starting to look like three or four o'clock.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** And now you've waited a bit.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:59]** So it's starting to be four or 430.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** I just try to go in at night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:01]** Yeah.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:07]** I'm wondering if we should wait until we have the cover of darkness to make an approach to Tatum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** Okay.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** Okay.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** Thoughts from the group?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:16]** I think we can get closer until that's necessary.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** Let's approach as much as we can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:26]** And the vehicle will approach as close as we can until we have to go out on foot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:29]** I trust your tactical expertise.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:32]** Wait, who's?

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** The bounty hunter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:36]** You want me to roll a survival check or anything?

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** Do you trust?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** Alright.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:42]** Sorry.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:45]** Do you need to roll a survival check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:47]** I could roll a survival check.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** Survival would probably give us the terrain to get down there.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** Like the best terrain to get down there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:58]** Yeah, but you don't need it in order to get down there in a way that... I'd say from this point, if you're going to walk...

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:01]** you're fine up until you want to actually like move in.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:10]** You see, you see that there's an area right around it, like right around the perimeter where, uh, it's flat and there are not as many things to hide.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:16]** I'd say from like 40 to 50 feet back, you, you can't, uh, there, there are no boulders.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:20]** There are, there are some craters and divots that maybe you could lay in, but there's no boulders.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** It's been kept clear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:22]** Okay.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:27]** So we moved to the edge of the clearing way a piece for some darkness, uh,

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:37]** Maybe this elf and her rabid abomination will go in for a snack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:37]** Okay.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:38]** A snack.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:42]** You wait a few minutes, and they don't.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:44]** They walk back north.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:46]** They start walking back north.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:55]** Turn their back on you, follow the perimeter, and walk back north around possibly the rest of the concrete bunker.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:57]** You haven't gone that way, so you don't know what's over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:02]** We stay out of their cone and we sneak up behind them.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:04]** Sorry, I'm in very big video game mode.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:05]** Yeah, no worries.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:14]** Is there anything we can do life science check wise or anything like that from this vantage point that's going to give us anything more?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:15]** Nope.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:18]** Dr. K already crushed it and got nearly everything.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:20]** How far are we now?

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:24]** You're walking up.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:48]** you are probably i'd say 40 50 feet away let's say let's say 50. what order are you in are you walking like two by two you're walking in a line i think we should form uh a semi-circle spread out yeah not split up spread so from so from left to right what's your recovery middle order who's going to be on the flanks

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** I don't mind Colin being out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:56]** Colin's on the flank, left or right?

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** Right flank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** Okay, right flank.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:01]** Which way did the people walk?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:02]** They walked towards the left side?

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:09]** No, you could see that from your point of view south.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:29]** the left side of the concrete bunker ends in the crater and you think the other side of that crater must be where the starships come in so you're looking north you see lights on where there is an entrance and you see that the building goes out to the east another you know 50 or 60 feet and then starts to move up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:35]** And that's which way the... They follow the perimeter of the building as if they're patrolling the other side of the building.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:39]** So Rick will be on the flank to that, like towards where they walked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:42]** Okay, so you're actually on the right flank.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:44]** Okay, so Rick's on the right flank.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:45]** Then Colin?

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** Colin will be on the left flank.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** Colin's on the left flank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:49]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:56]** will be on the... Colin's left flank, semi-middle.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:58]** And then where's Bernice?

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:01]** Center stage.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:02]** Yeah.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:06]** She's going to be in the apex of the semicircle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** Okay, in the apex of the semicircle.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:15]** I will move you guys best I can into what I think may be the position.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:19]** Because we want a concentrated firing arc, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:20]** Yeah.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** Concentrated firing arc.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** Kill zone.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:22]** Got it.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** You want a kill zone.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:25]** That's exactly it.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** You definitely want a kill zone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:33]** And we want to limit area of effect attacks by being spread.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:38]** Before we hop into this, is it safe to assume that we had a long rest at?

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:38]** Yes.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** Yes, you did.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** Yes, you did.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:45]** Okay.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:45]** Okay.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** So you've paused.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:50]** Maybe you're standing behind some boulders where... Is this on the map anywhere?

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Not yet.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:57]** And you all are going to... Are we just going to go to the entrance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:58]** If she's not there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** It's okay.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:01]** Yeah, why not?

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:01]** Okay.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:02]** Just walk in.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:05]** I will bring you guys to the map.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:08]** Tell me if I've put you in the right places.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:11]** The map of Terrapin Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:15]** Loading Terrapin Station.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:20]** I mean, I would have been a little bit more spread, but sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:47]** shoulder to shoulder you guys are on the map so the door for just I'm gonna click on the map but to the west like left side of the map where I'm clicking is the door that is like this is the door here and then it's just like a cliff where was the button that she was pressing that orange thing yeah okay can we do like uh can we I mean probably not a computer's check because we have to get up there but like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** You want to do a perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** Yeah.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:50]** We're locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:50 - 01:00:01]** But Rick is going to step forward one square, like diagonally one square, so he's in line with the side of the building where they are presumably around the corner.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:07]** And so he's going to have a beeline of sight when they come around, and he's got his gun up, and he's going to be prepped to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:09]** We'll say it's like 5.05, 5.10.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:14]** It's starting to get dark a little bit, but you think that you have maybe a bit of time before they would come around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:39]** uh i got a 29 on perception 29 on perception okay check for traps here's can't see that far i think maybe with an 11 but he wants to know if uh hey doctor what can you see can i remotely disable it could we remotely disable it or is it simple enough where i could get chad to do it i don't know whatever that is to turn off security 29 he just rolled


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:44]** Dr. OK, you are standing and you've you're moving up slowly.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:50]** I love that you all are like slowly moving in, staying in a very concentrated.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:56]** You're working as a team at this point, like staying in this like V formation, sort of checking your line of sight.

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:00]** Dr. OK is staying on the on the.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:03]** I mean, I would put us like a meter apart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:06]** But you guys put yourselves where you want to be.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:08]** If you want to move, move.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:11]** I'm not holding y'all up.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** I'm sticking with Bernice.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:16]** She is the safest bet.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:21]** So just for everyone at home, they have moved themselves as they have the ability to.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:23]** So Rick is like 15 feet in.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:23]** Everything's.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:26]** Here's and then Dr. Okay.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:28]** So Colin and Rick are like further out.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:29]** Cover Rick.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:33]** And here's and Dr. Okay are in the middle.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:34]** Bernice is right there in the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:35]** Colin, you should move here.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** I'll move one other.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** And then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** Getting optimally placed here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:43]** Yeah, I agree with that.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:43 - 01:02:11]** here's we should move a meter up but the same was right next to rick yeah no like rick should then move one meter up how does dr k said that is he like spread out guys we don't we don't want to get uh you know cornered by some well my whole thing is that the the creature and the the rep or in the elf woman you want to be on that corner i get it yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:16]** Dr. K, as you're spreading out, maybe you're like, move.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:18]** You're quietly talking into your arms.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:20]** Yeah.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** You all are ready.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** Spread out.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:28]** Hey, Dr. K, you look maybe down the side of your costa jet, whatever you're holding right now.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:37]** And you see that not only is there the door and these floodlights that shoot out about, you know, 15 feet in a semi-circle.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:41]** And it's just like, it's such a bleak scene.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:43]** It feels like Pleasantville without the color.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** Like, it's just gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:48]** And you're looking above the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** Yeah.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:54]** And you think you see a familiar sight of...

**[01:02:56 - 01:03:02]** some sort of gun port that can open and close.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:07]** Well, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:09]** I have to figure out what you want to do here.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:10]** Knocking at the door.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** Yeah, you're going to run up and knock.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:14]** It would have been nice if we had a dragon.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:14]** Yeah, sure.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** No, no, it's cool, Kelly.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:20]** Just expect all your NPCs to help you at any time.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:23]** Especially after the Lion's Mech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:27]** I feel like this dragon could have taken out that gunpoint pretty easily.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03
