**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** I do.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Yeah.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** And it was just kind of like.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:40]** Like, what does Kelly like today?

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:42]** So today, I guess it's Vinny's hoodie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:57]** yeah i like this yeah it's a company hoodie yeah let's get a little check on it i really i really want one with a nike in the center but you can't really find them um i haven't been able to find one but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** I know the one you're talking about.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** It's like in the center.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** The one that I saw doesn't have the words Nike.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** It just has the swish.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** Oh, because it's really good.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:07]** Well, because it's a knockoff from Vietnam, right?

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:10]** It probably is, because I saw it in Vietnam.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** I'll try to find it, Vinny, but it probably won't fit.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** It was just a checkmark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** I mean, it's probably genuine from Vietnam.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** I think that's where they make most of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:21]** It's actually probably all the real stuff.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** They make all the real stuff.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:29]** Well, we do have some banter choices this week from our subscribers.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:32]** So I feel like we should maybe dip our toes there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:33]** Thank you.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** Thank you for submitting banter topics.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** It's from...

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** Cryodemon.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Cryodemon.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:48]** Cryodemon says, posits.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:55]** Dear class, in any media except Starfinder, what's your favorite alien species?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** I'm going to say the Predator from Alien vs. Predator.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:11]** The visceral clicking and also was super geared up and had all this advanced technology and still chose to just strip down and f***.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:31]** up with its bare hands that that sort of dedication to the craft is is something that i aspire to wow that is cool man i'm gonna go with be a predator absolutely invader zim yeah invaders yeah my favorite zim is zim is cool yeah wow what a et is a a close second though


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]** Especially because my wife hates it.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:37]** And any time I go, phone, phone, she cries.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** It's great.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** Wait, what?

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** Why does she hate E.T.?

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:40]** I don't know.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:41]** She just hates it.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:47]** But I forced her to watch it one time, and now any time I make references to it, she gets really upset.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:48]** That's unfortunate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** That is unfortunate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:55]** Did you know that Invader Zim was canceled because it was too expensive for Nickelodeon's budget?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** I believe that.

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:03]** I think there was a rumor that it was canceled because one of the episodes was like super disgusting, but I'm sure it didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:06]** I think they brought it back for like a tiny bit.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:09]** And then they did like a movie or something weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:11]** There's an invaders in movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:12]** There isn't.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:15]** Yeah, there is.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** It was on Netflix.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:19]** Oh, what?

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:10]** Communicating through time is kind of an interesting thing to ponder.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** I thought that was a great movie.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:13]** You should go see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:16]** It was really undersold by society.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** That was Christopher Nolan, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:18]** No.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:26]** No, it's... No, it was... It was Denis, right?

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** Dune.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:36]** And then a close second is another feel-good.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:39]** Plus, I don't know if it's Disney or not.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** Batteries not included.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:45]** No.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** Batteries not included.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** That sounds familiar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:58]** It was like the other, there was a horror movie about things coming to life, and that was like the comedy version.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:03]** No, I know, but it was like a comedy version of the equivalent horror movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:05]** This is so good.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** This looks great.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:12]** The film tells the story about small extraterrestrial living spaceships that save an apartment block.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:14]** That's so cute.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:16]** There was another, like an ugly aliens movie.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:16]** What?

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:26]** It was a Disney film about these like short, big headed aliens that came to earth and like befriended a little boy and like had to hide with them.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** It was like, no, it was like Ninja Turtle style.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:33]** Like there were four of them and they were like goofy.


## Speaker_0

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:37]** Wait, Matt can be... Wait, like the 90s Ninja Turtles?

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:43]** Like the OG one that is really dark and like Raphael really goes through some shit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:48]** Yeah, it was the same level of... Are you listening to the Coneheads movie?

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** No, Coneheads is another great Aliens movie.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** Are you thinking about Coneheads, Kim?

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:54]** I'm not.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** I'm trying to think.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** I can't remember the name of that movie.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** Uh...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:02]** I just want to keep misnaming movies for you, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:04]** That disturbed me, that movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** Can I have a... Yeah, it's pretty intense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:08]** As a kid, I didn't like it.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** It scared me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** Third Rock from the Sun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** That's another good movie.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** Third Rock from the Sun.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:17]** Now I'm just going to go down this rabbit hole of great alien flicks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** Wow, I forgot about Third Rock from the Sun.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:26]** I would like to pass an honorable mention to the Boov from Home, the Pixar movie.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:53]** cute cuddly completely useless uh they are the best at running away and that is their entire personality um oh they're just like purple yeah blobs basically okay that's cool um yeah i i gave up on pixar i i every there's been so many oh this is a dreamworks movie oh maybe i'll give it a shot then it's good why did you give up on pixar


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:54]** I don't know.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:58]** Disney started to produce garbage after garbage, and I just couldn't do it anymore.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** I gave up at Toy Story 3.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:03]** When I saw Toy Story 4 just show up, I was like, I'm not going to watch this.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** It ended perfectly.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** Why would you continue it?

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:09]** Toy Story 3 is the best of the Toy Story series.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:32]** agree it ended perfectly also my favorite aliens are the gungans from star wars and i know people that's a very probably not a popular take but i think jar jar is done dirty i think he's not that bad okay he's not a dark he's okay he's he's definitely he might be but i think the gungans are funny not to set you further but there's a toy story 5 slated for 2026.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:49]** so okay so i was i was trying to find that movie i was talking about and i couldn't find it but marvin the martian popped up and looney tunes just kind of disappeared off the face of the earth and i need a a revival stat yeah warner brothers really fumbled that ball they really did

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** Yeah, what happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** I don't know.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:53]** Contents.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** Well, Looney Tunes content.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:58]** Also, like, Friendly Aliens, does The Abyss count?

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** Ooh.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** Are there Friendly Aliens in The Abyss?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:02]** Are they?

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:06]** Are you talking about that movie with, like, The Crevice or something?

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:06]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** This is an old movie.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:08]** No, no.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** The 1989 one?

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** Or the new one?

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** No.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** Not the gorge.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:13]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:17]** 1989.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** Was there a alien there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:19]** I like it.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:20]** Huh?

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:20]** What?

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** Was there what?

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** I don't remember there being a friendly alien.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** Oh, this is cool.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** The ships kind of look like they're out of the Covenant.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:26]** From the Covenant.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:27]** Halo.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** Yeah, that's cool, actually.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** I liked the gorge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** It's probably the other way around.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:31]** I haven't seen the gorge yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:32]** I didn't see it.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** I didn't see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:39]** I like the gorge, but I think they really missed an editing opportunity.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** Don't spoil it.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:46]** I'm not going to spoil anything, but I feel like the storyline wasn't told in proper order.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:51]** They could have built more drama in the beginning that would have led to... I think the reveal is great.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** I don't know.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:55]** I saw it coming.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:58]** What happens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:01]** Well, there are two that I didn't hear.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:06]** One was the Dugs.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:13]** And if you don't remember who the Dugs are, their best known character was Sebulba.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:29]** uh who's just a fantastic i'm down for star wars i know i mean i mean so much yeah i know yeah chance q uh and then the other one obviously is the reptiles i didn't hear anybody talk about reptiles


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:51]** You're going to say cryodamon said non-Starfinder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:54]** You vocalized it, John, which means you said it.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** Cryodamon wrote Starfinder.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** All I did was say it.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** It's like how, you know.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** That's what he said.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:03]** Today's episode is going to be really weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:05]** We'll be able to kick John's butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** His memory is not good.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:07]** Yes.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:08]** My memory is not good.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:13]** One of my all-time favorite alien movies is Enemy Mine.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:16]** And they kind of look like reptiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** I think you mentioned that when they first came out.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:20]** Anyway, thank you, Cryodemon.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** You are fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:29]** I wonder if reptiles ever forget who they are and just start talking in the wrong accent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:31]** That's a really good question.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** You sound like a lizard, man.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:36]** It's a really good question, man.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** This is a question for our fans.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:40]** Have you ever played a Reptoid?

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:43]** Besides, like, GMing, because that doesn't really count.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:46]** But, like, has anybody chosen to be a Reptoid in one of their games?

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** And if so, please tell us, how did that go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:49 - 00:14:03]** I have one comment about Enemy Mine, which is that the alien in Enemy Mine has a striking resemblance to the alien that Picard and Dathan at El Drell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** Oh, uh...

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:08]** Wait, Dharmak and Jalad at Tanagra?

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:09]** Yeah, that one.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** I love that.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:11]** Yes.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:12]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:16]** In which that is probably my favorite of all time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** Yeah, that's... That episode's a classic.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** That's a top TNG for me.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:21]** 100%.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** I am on the same page as you, Will.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:25]** TNG is such a good show.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** That's so good.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** I do also have a...

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:32]** I need a shirt that's like Darmok and Jelad.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** They are out there.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** I have almost bought them.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** They are out there.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:39]** I am going to message the person whose week it is.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:40]** Right.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:43]** On Discord.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** Right now.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:46]** So that individual has a write-in sentence.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Thank you.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:49]** Thank you for giving us awesome write-in sentences and banners.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** Appreciate y'all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Appreciate y'all.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** Is it in schedules?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:54]** No.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** I privately messaged them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:22]** yep i put it actually just in general i just put it in general yeah everybody could see kevin exactly what it was kevin just revealed it wasn't him it also isn't me all right so there you go have fun good job kelly getting spoiled did i message myself who knows find out next week all right so question does anybody who who wants to give a quick recap this week


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** I just realized I should open it up a little bit.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:32]** Maybe somebody wants to give their interpretation of the past, you know, one to three episodes.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** I mean, I'll go, but I don't want to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** I'm covering my nose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** So he's saying nose goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:37]** Okay.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** I'm not doing it.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** Come on.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** Kelly, Kelly, you gotta go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** I feel like John was the last one.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** Everyone else has higher stakes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** It's almost like no one takes notes.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:47]** But I'm the one saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:47]** Okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** Kelly, yes.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** All right.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:52]** It's not like somebody writes a summary every week and puts it somewhere.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:54]** All right, I'm going to look up Kevin's notes real quick.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** Let's see.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:55]** Hold on.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:57]** We'll save the podcast notes.

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:58]** Wait, where is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:00]** Are you just putting it into Google?

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:03]** Are you just Googling we'll save the podcast notes right now?

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:06]** Yeah, it's there in my history.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:08]** Even though I never go there.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:08]** All right, cool.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** I'm going to go there right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:11]** I'm also going to give my own take.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:14]** I need to hear your take based on what you like and what you don't like.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:15]** Of his notes?

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** All right.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:19]** No, just of the events that have happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:22]** You took no notes for 1.42, Kevin.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** We're doing 1.42.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:27]** All right, so this is what happened.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:29]** All right, shut up.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** This is what happened last episode.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** Oh, the drop.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:36]** There was like an android steward, okay?

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:38]** But this one was not a reptoid, I guess.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:38]** I can't remember.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** Rick hit her, all right?

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** But the fire damage did not go all the way through.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:49]** Rick steps into the room and sees another quote unquote steward and a Wetzel, or I always think of it as a pretzel.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:51]** And I guess other people sort of think of it like that too, Wetzel's pretzels.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** He steps back and then fires at the first steward.

**[00:16:54 - 00:17:00]** The pretzel comes up to attack, Colin shuts the door, doors to the north, unlock, doctor, okay, blah, blah, blah.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** So here's just a bunch of tactics and sh**.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:04]** And yeah, so we just fought a bunch of Reptoids.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** Basically, we were awesome.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:08]** We dispensed of them really, really quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:14]** We also opened the door that says don't open.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** We killed some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:25]** That was the best part, was finding the other android and giving her a gun, which I think... I don't remember if we ended on giving the gun or if we ended on Brick walking into the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** Brick enters the other...

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:49]** yeah come in yeah you did kill one reptoid steward outside but currently someone called us though as well you are nope that's the only thing that you've killed someone called us and we picked up which is not a good practice by the way you should pick up random calls you don't know yeah it was or there yeah and he was he was and he's he was gas he was trying to get


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:54]** Colin on tilt, gaslighting about his sister and his family and all that.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** I think he did successfully.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** Colin got very angry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:01]** He called Colin and he said, Hey Colin, I would like to order one fade delivered, please.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:05]** Here's my address.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:29]** colin was like all right bet i'm gonna like destroy the out of you and he was so angry and pent up the whole episode because that happened with his sister and then also his possible lover's dead probably so he's an angry man she was a reptoid so he's finna finish him oh we don't know who was her i'm just kidding uh what was her name i'm sorry i forget

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:30]** Who?

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:33]** Colin's girlfriend's name was Kanika Breeze.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:34]** She's dead now.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** I completely forgot.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:35]** Kanika Breeze.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:35]** Kanika, yeah.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:38]** You don't know if she's dead, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** Don't know if she's dead.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** Don't know if she's a reptoid.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:44]** All I know is Orviet Pike's going to catch these hands.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:45]** That's it.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:50]** Well, with that... Thank you, Kelly.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:52]** I got a two-piece with fries for Orviet Pike.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:53]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** Kelly, thank you for that beautiful recap.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** That was incredible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** Thanks, Kelly, for reading my notes.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** Oh, thanks.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Yeah, you're welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:03]** Yeah, thanks for reading the notes, man.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:03]** That was awesome.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:04]** That was super good.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:07]** Yeah, they're all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:09]** They're fine, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** I mean, they're great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** Kevin should keep doing them.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** Yeah, for sure.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** For sure.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** Yeah, awesome.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Cool.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** Yeah, great.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:19]** Well, with that, let's get back into combat.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** Kev, you were right.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:36]** Exactly where we ended was the moment when Brick steps out from the door to the north, the double doors to the north, just to give you guys who are listening at home a sense of the combat right now.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:39]** It is Brick and Bernice chilling at the top.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** Then Colin... Just hanging out.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:41]** Yeah, just hanging out.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:46]** Colin has opened the door across from the gripply...

**[00:19:46 - 00:20:06]** steward dr okay oh i forgot about that open the door to some sort of containment cell handed a gun to the android who was sitting there who then smiled then hears walks up retching just throwing up has all this gross because you're nauseated for forever


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** Man, Kevin didn't take that in the notes.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** Yes, I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** I did not take that in the notes.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:10]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:11]** But did I?

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Pierce threw up a lot.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:13]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:15]** I didn't type the word nauseated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:15]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:28]** And then the beautiful thing was that the android steward, who you all recognize from Dercalus, had thrown a stink grenade at Kevin.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:55]** and hit rick and here's uh but rick was good but rick you are currently standing in this like difficult terrain and maybe there's some goo on your shoulder you know what i'm saying just yeah yeah you just you just dust it off just enough okay top of round four we are jumping in this is a third episode of combat i think uh round four at the top going hard

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:59]** It's going to start with the Wetzel Pressles turn.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** And you know what it's going to do, Rick.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:03]** It is hellbent on taking you out.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:11]** And it rolls a 19 against KAC, which I think is a miss for you.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** Ah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:17]** It's a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:20]** Cool.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:23]** Then it swings, slams into the wall.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** I missed you.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** That sucks.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** It is going to stay where it's at for right now.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:31]** What do you do, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:37]** Rick is going to swing back with my battle axe.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:41]** 18 on the die for 26 to hit.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** Let me find my d12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** For 26 to hit?

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:46]** That is unnecessary.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** No one needs to hit that much.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** No one needs that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:55]** Oh, it's only a three on the die for a total of... 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** 11 points of slashing.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:59]** 11 points of slashing damage.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:11]** You did hit in the arm, cutting, and some of the crazy black-green ichor of this wet salt spills out onto the floor in front of you, getting stuck in that weird goo.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** Yeah, it's gross.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:13]** It is gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:16]** He pulls back his axe and pushes the shut button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** You shut the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:18]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:18]** Again.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** I cannot shut the door because it's paused.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** You're paused.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:21]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** Yeah, I'm shutting the door.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:25]** This is my favorite tactic ever.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:25]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** Cool, man.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:27]** Sounds good.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** They're not here to play games.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** So you shut the door.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:34]** And what happens?

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:35]** It's a good question.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:37]** The door shuts.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:41]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:49]** Oh, and then Rick is going to say, who has the... Oh, I forget what the... The beacon for Rudy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:51]** I can't remember.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:53]** Who has that?

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** He did give you a beacon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:19]** maybe here's takes everything yeah yeah i'm sorry i do uh here's a kleptomaniac and he has that particular communication device wait why do you want to call him here well uh what does rick say say what you want in character kevin jeez i literally said what i wanted in character okay oh okay

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** All right.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** It wasn't robotic enough, my guy.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** All right, fine.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:26]** Who has the distress signal from Rudy?

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:28]** Now would be a good time to use it.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** All right, cool.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** Well, here's also throwing up.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:38]** So it just like, he digs in his coat for it in his bandolier and he just barely manages to get it out.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:43]** He throws up so much on it that the button actually like activates.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:45]** It's that much throwing up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:45 - 00:24:11]** i don't think any of that actually happens um you get some action right when his turn comes yes when your turn comes the only thing you can do is pull it out because you can take one move action per turn he just pulls it out and falls upon it is not your turn yet but when it but when it is i'm assuming you're gonna turn up yeah yep okay cool it is someone's turn

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:20]** Colin, you see the other android move up to behind this gripply.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:26]** And they're going to take a shot at you.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:32]** Get yourself ready for a 27 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** Do I get partial cover from the gripply?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:40]** Does it help with... Let's say yes.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:45]** Well, from the gripply... No, because you're standing right in front.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:50]** You're standing in between the door and the gripply.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:58]** I can't see where you guys are because the map is faded, but if they have to shoot through their ally, then it's a soft cover.

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:59]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** They don't have that soft cover.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** I mean, not according to the line.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** From their corner.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** Okay.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:08]** Well, I mean, their corner to mine would be a straight line, I think.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** Is it their corner to the center?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:15]** One corner to all four of your corners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** Oh.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Uh, maybe.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:19]** Arguable.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** Yeah.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:23]** Even if you did it, would that help with the 27?

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** E-A-C-K-A-C.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:28]** Uh, against E-A-C.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** Uh, what is soft cover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** Plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:32]** Yeah.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:35]** No difference.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:35]** Okay.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:38]** That is nine points of fire damage.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** In consequential.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:41]** Nine points of fire damage.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:44]** Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** Fire!

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** Fire!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** All right.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:50]** Yes?

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:58]** I need to pull up Kev's notes, because I remember doing a thing last episode, and now I can't remember if I thought about doing it or if I actually did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** If you actually did it?

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** It is the crypto's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:03]** I probably didn't take the notes on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** My reflective armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** You did cast it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:08]** I did cast it?

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:09]** Yes, you did.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:10]** Cool.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:12]** I'm going to dispel it.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** What does that do?

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:16]** I'm so glad you asked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** Yeah, I'm so glad that I asked that.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:19]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** What does that do?

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:23]** Make a DC 15.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:28]** Sorry, Hero Lab is not giving me my spell, so I've got to look it up the hard way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:30]** The old-fashioned way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:33]** The old-fashioned way.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** The oldest of fashions.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** Dismiss the spell as a reaction.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** Armor crackles...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** I don't think there's a check on it.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:43]** They just take the damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** I guess there's not a save.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:50]** They take an amount of damage equal to... Reflex for half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:51]** That's what it is.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** DC 15 reflex save.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** You make a DC 15 reflex save.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:56]** Yeah, you do it.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** Yeah, you do it.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:58]** Not me.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:58]** You don't.

**[00:26:59 - 00:26:59]** Actually, no.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:02]** Good thing they got a 15.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** Fudge.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** Oh, come on, man.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** Nailed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:07]** So they take nine half to four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:13]** So they take four points of damage as the fire hits them.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:16]** And you see that not all of that fire goes through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:19]** That is not fire damage.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** That is force damage.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** Four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** Oh, it comes back as force?

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:25]** Yes.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** Okay.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:29]** Ooh, way to get me good.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Well done there.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** Just a little pew, pew, pew, pew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** Just a little pew, pew, pew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:35]** Yeah, no, it makes sense.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** Just a little pew, pew.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:38]** With that.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** As you...

**[00:27:43 - 00:28:04]** explode your reflecting armor dispelling it and it sends this force back and they stumble flavor stumble not mechanical uh you see coming from the corner of your eye the apprehension class capture pole from the gripple as a 29 to hit

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** Okay.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:12]** That is going to be 2d8 of damage.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** I did not miss that.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** There's an eight there.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** Oh, that's good.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** Okay.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:25]** That's just 19 points of damage to you.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:26]** Woof.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:28]** Yeah.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Not playing.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:31]** Slippy ain't playing.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:33]** Colin, it's your turn.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:37]** You successfully pushed back the attack.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:42]** And then you were hit with this apprehension class capture ball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:42]** What do you do?

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** Am I grappled or is he just hit me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** He just hit you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:46]** Okay.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:48]** Cool.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** First thing I'm going to do is close this door.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** Okay.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** I'm just going to hit the button.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** Doors close.

**[00:28:55 - 00:29:00]** Turn to the group and say, they're up here and they're hitting pretty hard.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:01]** Okay.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:31]** um and he's going to take a five foot step down south away out of the doorway and uh fudge that's two move actions uh i guess that's my turn that's a double move that is a double move okay dang it i was gonna take a shot but i i don't think that's the that's not the move okay i don't want to stand right in front of that doorway anymore okay that's a bad place to be that's it that's an intense place to be yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:34]** Yeah.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:34]** Yeah.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:34]** Okay.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:34]** I like it.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Here's what are you doing?

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** It is your turn.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** Do you throw up and pull out the thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** Yeah.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:42]** Here's pulls out the, uh, the communicate communicator.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:44]** It falls to the ground.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:49]** Could a side effect of his like, yeah.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:53]** So you throw something and then like now,

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:56]** we're calling the coolest guy in the world.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:56]** Okay.

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:01]** Who I guess is going to show up with like a fleet of whatever they're called again.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** So you hit the emergency beacon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** So you pull it out.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:06]** That's the emergency beacon pulling it out.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:10]** You don't, you can't hit it yet to activate it as a move action too.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:12]** Well now I can, cause it's my turn, right?

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** Cause I could do like a double move thing.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:13]** No, you can't.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:16]** You can make one single move per action.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** That's the thing, man.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** One single move per action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:23]** Oh, because I'm... Because I'm f***ed right now.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:25]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:25]** That was the whole time.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:33]** Well, I guess he just asks, well, through, like, heaving and hurling, like, for Dr.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:33]** O.K.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** 's help once again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** We'll see how it goes.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** This is the second round that you're nauseated?

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:41]** Of four, I believe.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:41]** Okay.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:41]** Yeah.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:42]** Dr.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** O.K., it's your turn.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** You have just handed...

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** a gun and here's came up to you throwing up.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:56]** Um, and Bernice has given me all kinds of help me.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:57]** Yeah.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:04]** Cause she is standing directly next to, um, what's this dude's name?

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:05]** Brick.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Yeah.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** Yeah.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:10]** So she's going to take, she's going to be like, help me, help me.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:15]** He's going to go full, full move.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:16]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:22]** with Bernice and have her take a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:23]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:24]** Okay.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:31]** And then she's going to move again down to the group.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:32]** Ooh.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:37]** And Dr. Okay is going to pull out his apprehension class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** Two can play at that game.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:40]** Mm-hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:41 - 00:32:03]** nice okay so that's your moves she moves you are consolidating what's happening i like it i like it well it could be a terrible idea that's okay okay that's that's your moves we'll see the android takes the pistol not wearing any armor let me show you guys what they look like

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:05]** Where's my artwork?

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** That's my artwork.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:21]** She has this like very, yeah, this very pale, sad, but also just like gloomy, dour expression, except for that smile when you hand the pistol and I'm like, hey, you want to go f*** up some reptoids?

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:42]** uh she has this like cherry red hair in locks around her face not wearing this armor as you can see um but is uh is wearing pretty much just plain clothes at this point just like a just like a barely just like a flight suit um that's not even tactical uh yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** I have an extra second skin.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:47]** Could I give it to her within?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Probably be a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** Yeah, it would be move action.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** I don't know what it would take for her to put it on.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** We have to look at donning armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:56]** It's like 60 seconds or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:58]** It depends on the- I'm sorry, who is this?

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** Where did we find her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** She was in the closet.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:03]** Yeah, you are just seeing her, Colin.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** Sort of, as you've stepped back.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:13]** You see that the door is open to this small cell, and you can't read Reptoid, so you don't know what it says.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** But the door is open.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:19]** Donning armor is four rounds to don light armor.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Yeah.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** So maybe not right now.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:22]** That sucks.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:26]** Or you can drop it there for now if you want.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** It is her turn.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** She takes the gun.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:32]** She steps forward, looks at you, Dr. Okay.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Colin adheres.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** This is the first time that you're seeing her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:38]** She says, where are they?

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** Barely pay attention.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:43]** They're all around us.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:47]** Guys, I feel like we're being watched.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** Oh, wow.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** Oh, that was a crowd.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:51]** Oh, wow.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** You just dropped it right there.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** I mean, I didn't know where else we were going to use.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:57]** It's good.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** It's good.

**[00:33:59 - 00:33:59]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** No, that was good.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** We probably are being watched.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:05]** I would have never known.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:07]** You would have pulled it off.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** All right.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:11]** The question is, what does she do?

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** You said that they're all around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:16]** Not these guys.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:26]** But there's a dude at the end of the hall, and there's a few dudes in this other room who you might recognize.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** Yeah, I probably do recognize them.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:30]** I'm ready to take a fucking shot at them.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:43]** She steps through, slams against the wall, turns, just takes in what's happening on the left and on the right, sees Brick, and just smiles and says, F***ing you.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:46]** Takes a shot at Brick.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:52]** with a incredibly solid, jeez, that's a good shot.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:52]** That's 28 to hit.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** She is on top of it.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:59]** The tactical needler.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** It's a D4, right?

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:07]** Yeah, I think plus five or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:13]** Yeah, that is eight points of damage as she fires right at Brick.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** Putting herself out there.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:18]** Immediately, though, she is gunning for vengeance.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:21]** Trying to take out these assholes.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:22]** Maybe you'll talk to her after.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:23]** Maybe you won't.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** You know who's turn it is now?

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:25]** Brick.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:28]** And you know what he's going to do?

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** He's going to fire back at her.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** He's going to be like, see you guys later.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** Bye.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** See you later.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:37]** Okay.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:42]** That is against her with nothing on.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:46]** He absolutely levels his weapon at her.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:52]** And fire damage just flies across in between Colin and Dr. Roque.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Point blank.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** Just shot for shot.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** And she takes eight points of damage.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Does she get soft cut?

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** From them?

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:02]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** I can't see where Brick's at.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** I'm assuming he's here.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** Yeah, he's right here.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:10]** So pick a corner and go through all four corners of her.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:13]** And if you pass through anybody else's square, then that is soft cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** So then she would get soft cover.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** So maybe she wouldn't get it.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:16]** Let's see.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:21]** That was a always fun shooting against yourself.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:22]** Does that?

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:24]** Nope, it still hits.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** Even with that plus four, it still hits.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** Right in the shoulder.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** She has no armor on.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:34]** So for the three of you there, you're probably starting to see what it really looks like when you get hit with something.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** She's already weakened, you can tell.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** So she's not at the top of her hit points.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:40]** But she's bold enough to go out there and take the hit anyway.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:44]** But you're seeing what weapons can do when they hit, you know, nearly bare skin.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:51]** And you see that the fire damage really, like, it leaves intense burns on her shoulder already.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** Top of the round.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** What's going to happen?

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:57]** What is going to happen here?

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** What is that move?

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** Speed.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:04]** We're top around five now.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:05]** Colin.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** How much damage has she taken?

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:13]** She just took eight points of damage.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:15]** She was clearly not at full.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:17]** I think I want to keep her around.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** It is not.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** I hear you.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** It is not your turn yet.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:20]** Just FYI.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:21]** Sorry.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** Oh, cool.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:25]** Sorry, I didn't know if you were planning on doing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** I was looking at the turn order.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:30]** It was like, I don't see the icon on my guy, but he said Colin, so.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Yep.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:32]** He was asking you.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:40]** No, I was saying, Colin, you need to get ready because coming from around the corner.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** The Wetzel comes up.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:42]** It's a pretzel.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:45]** Wetzel's pretzels comes up to attack you.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** Just phases through the door.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:46]** God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** Huh?

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Just phases through the door.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** You shut the door?

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** Oh, I didn't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** Okay.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:55]** That's why I shut the door and I moved down.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:55]** That's our strata.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:56]** That was my whole turn.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:57]** I missed that.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** I missed that.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:58]** Jeez.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** Open and shut doors.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** I missed that.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** Man, calm down.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:01]** Cool.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** Calm down.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:02]** Goodness.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:02]** All good.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** My bad.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** My bad.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Follow the rules, John.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:05]** My bad.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:06]** I'm following the rules.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:08]** I didn't even know that that was a thing.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** All right.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:09]** Cool.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:13]** The door opens and you see that there is a wet salt there.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** And that's the turn.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** That's it.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** Rick18, what do you do?

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:18]** You're standing in front of a closed door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:25]** Uh, Rick is going to take his one step forward in the difficult terrain.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:26]** That cost you two steps.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:27]** Yep.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** Right?

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:31]** And then he's going to travel all the way up to the door.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:38]** Well, yeah, he's going to end up squeezing through everybody and ending up in the corner next to Colin.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** I think that's as far as he can move.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** Okay.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** So that would be his whole move.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:48]** And then he's going to ready an action to attack anybody that comes within reachable distance.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** Melee distance?

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:50]** So if Brick steps forward.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** Yeah.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:56]** So if Brick steps forward or if the Wetzel comes into the next square over, then Brick's going to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:58]** So you double moved?

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:00]** Or was it a single move to get there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** It was a single move.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** It was just difficult terrain for that first step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** So the first step was 10 feet, right?

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:05]** Instead of five.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:06]** And then you had it.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** Cool.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:08]** Cool.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** I like it.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:10]** All right.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** I know what's going to happen next.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:13]** I like it.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:19]** The android slams up against the wall.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:36]** Similar training as the other android, but the android steward that you're seeing, the one that you saw at Tercalus, slams up against the wall behind the wet cell and is going to take a shot at Rick19.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:41]** Actually, does she take a shot at Rick or does she take a shot at Colin?

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** Brick.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** She takes a shot at Brick.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:47]** No, she takes a shot at Colin.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:49]** Is he called Brick because he's bad Rick?

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:53]** Oh!

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** Colin, that's a... Wait, it's like a worst.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** I personally love that thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:56 - 00:40:00]** Colin, that's an 18 against EAC.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** Does that hit?

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** That does not hit.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** Oh, fires off.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** Unfortunately, though.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Weird.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:09]** Strange.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** So strange.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** Okay.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:13]** Wow.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:15]** How's this going to work?

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** I know how it's going to work.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** The Gripley steps up.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** That's what it is.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** Ooh, wait a minute.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** No, that hits.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** Okay.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:27]** Rolls.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:35]** And you all hear again another ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:42]** As another stinking goo mark two grenade goes off the gripply.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:43]** Did they also move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** They did move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** So did they drop their weapon?

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:47]** Oh, because they were holding the apprehension class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:48]** You're right.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** So then they don't do that.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:51]** Okay.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** Yeah, that's a two-handed weapon.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:56]** So then they would need to drop their weapon or switch weapons and then move.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:57]** Okay.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** So they don't throw that.

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:58]** Good call.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** Thank you, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:00]** All right.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** That's two this round, John.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** It's coming next round, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:07]** It might.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** If you want a TPK, you got to do it by the rules.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** That's all we're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** You know what?

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** Yeah, no, no, no, no.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** For sure.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** Hey, man, we're at Terrapin.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:19]** Things ain't going to be straightforward and easy, as you've seen so far.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** Colin, what are you doing?

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:23]** You all are corralled literally in the middle.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** It's like a boxcar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:29]** Yeah, we're in what might be affectionately referred to as a murder hole.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Yeah.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** And we're kind of surrounded a little bit.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:36]** This is some good tactics, John.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:38]** I'm both impressed and a little terrified.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** Good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** I also love my pants, so I hear you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:52]** Well, just for the listener, we are literally in like two by two stacked square, like taking up six squares adjacent to each other.

**[00:41:52 - 00:42:02]** Behind us is the floor is still covered in the sticky mess from the last sticky grenade or stinky grenade.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:10]** And then ahead of us, there are three bad guys through the door to the right and then one bad guy to the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** What you gonna do?

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:14]** And here I am, stuck in the middle with you, Rick.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:15]** Shut the door.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** Don't shut the door.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:22]** Come on now.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:39]** Colin, seeing that this is going to be a fight to just pull out all the howitzers, is going to turn to the android in front of the gripple and say, today is not your day.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:43]** and shoves his hand in his direction, casting Mind Thrust.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:44]** Oh!

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:45]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** At the second level.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** Bring it.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** Bring it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** Does that take an attack of opportunity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** Because the Wet Salt is there in front of you?

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:53]** Yes.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** You're casting a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:56 - 00:43:00]** Just force... It might say... I don't remember if a Mind Thrust says... Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:01]** Right.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:04]** But if you cast a spell...

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:32]** and casting a spell does trigger an ao does mine thrust say it does it without it'll specifically say this it would trigger now uh here's what i'm gonna do what's he gonna do i'm gonna move to here okay you're so that's a five foot yes okay um but that's a normal move it's not a step not a guarded step oh so your attack of opportunity there's a mechanical reason of doing this okay okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** That's an 18 against KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** That misses.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:39]** That misses.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:42]** You son of a... Okay.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:45]** Now I'm going to cast Mind Thrust.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:49]** But I'm going to do it at the 10th level.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** 15th level, actually.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** Wow.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** That is 150 Ds.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:56]** I'm going to do it at the tether loop guy.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:57]** Oh.

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** The frog looking dude.

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** Gripply.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** Yeah.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** The gripply.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** Thank you.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:01]** Slippy.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:03]** I lost gripply in my head.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** It is DC1616.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:28]** DC16 rolled a 16 on the dash.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** How do you keep doing this?

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:33]** Okay, I pre-roll all my rolls.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** So I just pick a number.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:34]** No, I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:38]** I pre-roll all my numbers.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:40]** I have a list of numbers.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:42]** Just pick whatever one I want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:46]** From 1 to 20, and I randomly choose the one I want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** If I roll them enough times, I have as many numbers as I want.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:51]** I free roll the adventure.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** The whole book.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:55]** It takes like three hours, but I forever possible roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:57]** Those are not the free rolls we're looking for.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:59]** Okay.

**[00:44:59 - 00:44:59]** Just going to throw that out there.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** Yes, that is half.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:06]** And I'm jingling my bells so that I can roll it up.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:06]** All right.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:07]** Jingle them.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** Jingle them all the way.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** Nine, eight, four.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:15]** Jingle them in his face.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** Nine, eight, seven.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:19]** So 8, 24, half to 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:24]** 12 points of damage as this creature ribbits in pain.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:28]** Just a complete, like, ugh.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:31]** Like a croak, you know, at night, like, rah, rah.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** But like, rah, rah.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** Horrible.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:36]** As you thrusted your bells in their mind.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** You rang their minds bells.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:40]** Yeah.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** Okay.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** Do a mindf**k. And then.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** You put their balls, your balls.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:45]** And then.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Well, so that's a move and then a spell.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Yep.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** And then you can move again.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:52]** And then I'm going to move right back to where I was.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:52]** Okay.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** Just as a little.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** And the what's else already against AOL.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:58]** So can't do it.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:01]** Here's good turn, Colin.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** Here's you are in the murder hole.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** You've thrown up on the emergency beacon.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** Do you go to move it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** Yeah.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:13]** Yeah, it's going to be hard for me to follow that up, especially with the fact that I can't do it.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:16]** So here's, like, basically he sees Dr. O.K.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** slither away.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:20]** And he's just, like, after his request for aid.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:25]** So he just rolls on his back and his hat's, like, covering his face.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** You're prone.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:26]** Push.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:28]** And then...

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:31]** Let's just, just for flavor reasons, here's his rolling around in agony.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:35]** So cursing every, every God that there is.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:35]** Yeah.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:36]** All right.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:47]** So, and then he takes his fist and bumps the alert, the thing, the, the device to get Rudy, the most interesting man in the world over here, the beacon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** Personal distress beacon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** And that is round three of four.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:54]** Will, I think you were saying, you were saying something too?

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** Is Rudy on his way that way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:56 - 00:47:00]** There's nothing I can do for you, man.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:00]** Just walk it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:04]** Walk it off, bro.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:11]** I'm just saying that Hears doesn't know that, so Hears is just... He's begging you for help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:13]** Colin, you had your hand raised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:18]** No, I was just going to ask if he pushed the button or not, and that was answered in his turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:20]** He pushes the button.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:23]** Okay, I'm running here.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:25]** That may be the move that saves us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** So good job.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** Dr. O'Kay, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:31]** By the time he gets here, we might get him to stick around and help.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:39]** Being in this really confined space with all of these horrible people.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:45]** Dr. OK is going to instruct Bernice to try and get away.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:47]** Oh, OK.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:49]** So she's going to start going to the end of the hall.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:49]** OK.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:53]** And start walking through the goo.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Yeah.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** And the goo, I think she gets here.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:04]** And then Dr. OK is going to.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:08]** I think we should find a better position and start walking.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:30]** coming back but i think um before he goes he's gonna try and pop a shot off with the uh costa jet okay that is it is soft cover yep so they have plus four or what yeah i'll just fire one i'm not gonna go for it try it try it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:31]** Against who?

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** Against which creature?

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:45]** The Wetzel, Brick, the Android, Steward, or the... The Droid, or was it Grimly, the one with the... The Gripley was the one with the apprehension class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** With the grenade?

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:49]** Yeah.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:49]** Okay.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:52]** I mean, it's the same cover no matter who I shoot, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:59]** I think the Gripley will have a full... No, not... They won't have improved, but they'll have regular cover.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:01]** which is just that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** I'll hit the Wetzel Pretzel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** Wetzel Pretzel.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:04]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:06]** Oh, man.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** That's not going to do it.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:12]** I fired an 11.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** Fired an 11.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:17]** Unfortunately, does not hit Wetzel Pretzel at this time.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** And Dr. Argue is going to start moving.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** You start moving back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** Okay.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** I hear you.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** You move in front of the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** Pull a Thaddeus.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:29]** And make sure that it stays closed.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** Yeah.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:31]** Uh, okay.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:36]** This other Android fires again at brick.

**[00:49:37 - 00:50:01]** misses entirely because she is seeing you walk away she doesn't know colin or rick or here's yet uh and while she is realizing that you're on her side she also is realizing that without any armor and just having taken eight points of damage uh she could be out with one good hit you know i'm saying so she's going to start moving back as well uh and is going to stand in front of you

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:06]** trying to spread out what's happening here.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:11]** Brick smiles confidently.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:21]** And you can just see that the smile just... God, it just... It looks too... It looks like... It's like Uncanny Valley human.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:29]** Just the way that whatever Brick is, he's not meant to be a human male.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** Holds up the gun confidently.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:35]** Does a full attack against Rick and Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** Like one each?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** Yeah, one each.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** At a minus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** At a minus four.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:46]** Yes, yes, yes, indeed.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:49]** Kevin's in like full form today.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** He is in full form.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:53]** Kevin, that's a 23 against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:54]** That hits me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:55]** That hits you.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:58]** Okay, you take eight points of damage.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** Okay.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:06]** Colin, that is a 18 against EAC.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:07]** That's a miss, yeah?

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** No dice.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Okay.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** You guys are starting to get down here in the stamina.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:12]** What are you at, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** Stamina is almost gone.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** Six stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:18]** Okay.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:20]** Starting to get into the real digits here.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:22]** That is the end of round six.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** We're at the top of round seven.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** Oh, man.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:32]** There's some tactics here, and you all are starting to... You got to make a breakthrough somewhere.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:34]** Somebody's got to go down here soon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** Where is Rudy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:42]** Rick, that is a natural one.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** Sorry, Colin.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:47]** A natural one from Wetzel's Pretzels on attacking you.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** Aw, too bad.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:53]** I think we'll do a critical fail deck.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Critical fumble!

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:56]** Critical fumble!

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:56]** Here we go.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:56]** Ready?

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** And three, two, one.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** Tell me when to stop.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:08]** This is against a melee attack doing kinetic damage.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** Oh, what?

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** That's a weird one.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:17]** Tell me it didn't make sense.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** Tell me again.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:21]** Three, two, one, stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** He's doing magic tricks over here.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** Do a magic trick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** Fog of War.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** This is so weird.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:37]** For 1d4 rounds, you threaten no squares and can't attack any targets you can't see now.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:40]** So no threatening.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:45]** I think as they come and try and slam and hit you, it hits the door.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:55]** And then there's like a pain that radiates through their senses and they are more or less like kind of like stunned for a split second and can't take any AOOs.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** Nice.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** That sucks for me.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** Great for you all.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:02]** Rick19, what are you doing?

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** People are moving out behind you.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** People are stepping in to shoot you.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** This battle is developing very quickly.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:14]** Uh, Rick is going to... Again, he wasted his last round.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:18]** Oh, no, I guess he didn't waste it, but he didn't swing at anybody.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:23]** Now, this time, he's actually going to...

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:34]** He's going to stand his guard, and he's going to hold his axe up, and he's going to prep a standard action to swing at anybody who comes into their proximity.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:41]** And as he's doing that, he's concentrating, and you see him...

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:48]** His tense muscles almost start to just spew out like a black smoke, kind of.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:57]** And then it starts to kind of form into a cloud, a wall of clouds that's going to take up the three squares.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:01]** One, two, and three.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:07]** And so he's using a Danite Surge instead of using my dispersal or dispersion like I've been using.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** I'm going to create a...

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** a cloud.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:17]** It only actually does, it provides 10% concealment to us, but not for me.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:20]** I can attack without concealment through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:44]** whoa okay so it's not enough to hide um but it does but it's ten percent concealment it's ten percent mischance against anybody any allies that are in the um the array well that's cool okay so that are in it or on the other side uh that i was trying to clarify i think it's like going through it but i'll read more okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:45]** Wow.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:49]** So that's a Nanite Array giving you some sweet, sweet.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** Yeah, that's really cool.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** That is impressive.

**[00:54:54 - 00:55:05]** So if she wants to shoot at you, this Reptoid Steward Android thing, it's 10%.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Okay.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:11]** I need to get a D1 Hundo.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:14]** Let's see what that D100 is going to be.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** So 10 or below.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:21]** Oh, no, that is a 97.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** Sorry.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:27]** The question is, she is rolling an attack against you.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:29]** That is a 28 to hit.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:31]** What the ****?

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** Against Rick, 19.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:34]** Nine points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:37]** I am down into my health, everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:40]** He's in the health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** I am in my health now.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:45]** I am no longer stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:46]** I am in my health now.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:50]** And she takes a five foot step over behind on the other side of the wall.

**[00:55:53 - 00:56:02]** Now it is the turn of the gripply.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** And you know what they're doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** Ting, ting, ting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** Throws a stinking goo grenade.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** So did they drop their?

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** Yeah, they already did that last time.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** I swear to God.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:12]** They dropped it.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** They dropped it.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** They dropped it.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** And they are going to fire it.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** Sorry, throw it.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:27]** And right in front of you, in between all of you.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:30]** And by all of you, I mean Rick, Colin, and Hears.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** I need you all.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:32]** Poor Hears.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** Poor Hears, man.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** Is it going to stack?

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** Oh, my God.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:37]** All right.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:41]** This was the fourth round, so it would just add more rounds.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** Is this Fortitude?

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:47]** I need you to make a fortitude saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:50]** Is this considered a poison or disease?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:55]** This is considered a... No.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:59]** I don't think so.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:04]** It's just a substance that causes you to be nauseated if you fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:05]** Sounds like a poison.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** Sounds like a poison.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** That does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:13]** I don't see anything here saying that it is a poison or disease.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:15]** It is a greasy gunk that has an odor.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** A powerful odor.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** That's all it says.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** Does a 13 pass?

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:23]** A 13 does not pass, Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** Rick is nauseated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:28]** You're nauseated for two rounds, Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** Two rounds.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** Wait, do I get a missed chance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** Uh, no.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** Do they get a missed chance?

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Wait, they do.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:39]** Because they were trying to throw through it.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:43]** So if they get a 10 or less... No, they got a 58.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:45]** They were fine.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:46]** They were fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:50]** Hears and Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** Hears, what did you get?

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:54]** Hears also got a 13.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:04]** Hears is like, oh no.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** It smells bad.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:03]** You can follow the briefcase.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:09]** And he hands the second skin.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** Oh, nice.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:12]** Nice.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:12]** Smart.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:17]** And then he's going to take a step up.

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:21]** I guess I have to go through...

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:25]** I really just want to do one step up, but... Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:26]** You can do that.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:30]** You can take a... Yeah, that's 10 feet of movement, which is all slick and weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:30]** Okay.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:33]** I'm going to just do Bernice's movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** Yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:38]** Bernice is going to inch her way over...

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:42]** And then Dr. Okay is going to shoot with the cost of jet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:42]** Okay.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** There's soft cover.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:44]** Yeah.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:45]** Go for it.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:47]** Just nothing else I can do.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:47]** Yep.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** I get it.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:48]** I get it.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** Shoot with a cost of jet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:51]** Terrible hallway.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:54]** And I rolled another five on the die.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** So that misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:57]** Oh my God.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:59]** This is a tough one.

**[01:02:59 - 01:02:59]** This is a tough one.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:00]** Okay.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:05]** Dr. Okay starts moving forward, trying to back up y'all from the back.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:06]** Keep the reinforcements.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:10]** Bernice is going into the room.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** It is the Android's turn next to you.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:14]** She, she says, thank you.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** But if you're staying, I'm staying.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:25]** And she, and then she points her gun and looks down and also takes a shot at the other Android at the end of the hall and

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:29]** What is that going to be?

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:31]** That is going to be... Oh!

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:35]** Even with soft cover, that is a hit.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:36]** That is a 26.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:38]** Even with soft cover, that is a hit.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:45]** With the tactical needler pistol, that is going to be 8 points of damage.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:46]** And...

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:51]** The android at the end of the hall looks severely weakened.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:56]** And I think Rick and Colin, you see that she is on her last legs.

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:59]** It's Brick's turn.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** It's Brick's turn.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:07]** Takes a... You know what?

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** What does he do?

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:11]** Ah.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:12]** I know.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:14]** Takes a step.

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:20]** Points his gun at Rick.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:26]** And then says to you, Rick, I need you alive.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:30]** And then points his gun at Colin.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** That's so rude.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:33]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:34]** Why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:36]** Why do they need me?

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:37]** He's evil.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:38]** He's more evil.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:39]** Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:40]** That's why.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:40]** Yeah.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:42]** Because he needs to balance the light and the dark.

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:44]** That's exactly what's going to turn you into a reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:45]** Yeah.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:45]** Yeah.
