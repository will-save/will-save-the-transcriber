**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** I'm your mega GM, John Swan.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:59]** And just like our episode recording time and that banter music, we are coming in late tonight.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** We're a little punchy.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:04]** We've been cooking it, getting it ready.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:12]** We've been stewing the episode for like an hour and a half, ready, waiting, just sitting, getting it all juiced up.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:14]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:14]** I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** Cool.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:15]** Yeah.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** I'm glad that we're all behind that.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:17]** That's awesome.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** Yeah, that was cool.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:19]** I love that.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** Hey, let me stop talking for a second.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:23]** I'm going to give you guys a banter question.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Quick thought.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** First thing that comes to your brain.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:31]** What's the best new thing that you have discovered or been using lately?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:35]** My best new thing is going to be a best old thing.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:46]** So I am like all digital, everything, e-reader, phone, laptop, tablet, like all of the electronics to make life more convenient.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:54]** And still every few months I come back to a fountain pen and a notebook.

**[00:02:54 - 00:03:12]** The experience of putting a pen to paper is so, one, important to impress things into my mind, and two, cathartic to process and get things out onto paper that I can't just keep jumbled upstairs the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** Have you tried the digital paper?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** I...

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:24]** What's funny is I've shopped for those for the last four weeks and I really want to try one, but there's nowhere to try it.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:26]** So like the barrier of entry is too high.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:50]** you gotta drop like 400 bucks to get a decent one the remarkable series yeah remarkable one looks really cool remarkable is is the most uh popular right now kindle scribe is probably close if you want a hybrid e-reader and note taker super note has some pretty compelling offerings kobo even has like a a good one um

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:55]** So like, there's a lot of manufacturers, but here in the U S you've got to either like hope Amazon carries it.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:59]** Cause they have a decent return policy or if you hate it, you're just kind of out of luck.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** So yeah, I have thought about it and I've researched them a whole lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:08]** You just got to ride a train a bunch and watch for somebody that has one and say, Hey, can I try that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** I just, right.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** But even that, why train?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:15]** Cause there's a lot more different people on a train that you can, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:18]** Cause I don't talk to people on trains.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** What's wrong with train people?


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:23]** Have you ridden the Amtrak here?

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** Who wants to talk on a train?

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:29]** I feel like it depends on what train you're riding.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:35]** We have now moved from countries to transportations, transportation methods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** I still didn't know Vinnie's answer.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** So your answer is pen.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** It's a pen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:43]** Are you a person who talks to the person in the seat next to you, like throughout the flight?

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** A thousand percent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:50]** I have developed systems to gauge their desire to interact.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:54]** Like I will always board a flight with a pack of gum.

**[00:04:54 - 00:05:00]** And like when before we start taxiing, I open it up and I take a piece for myself and I offer it to the people next to me.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** And like, that's my litmus.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:10]** How they respond to that question is whether or not I'm going to have a new friend by the time we land or I'm just going to put my headphones on and read a book.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:13]** I'm not intrusive with it, but yeah, I love strangers.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** Strangers are the best.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:16]** You've never offered me a piece of gum.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** I didn't have to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:23]** I'd say one out of eight flights, I am fully engaged in a conversation for the entire flight.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:35]** And recently I was on a flight where I was talking to a guy that flies coach for fun, but he was just coming back from, he said he cruises three out of four weeks every month.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** And his wife doesn't go anymore because she's too old.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:40]** But this guy owned several... I don't know.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:44]** He was explaining that he did some kind of insurance company.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:47]** That he started up three different insurance companies and sold them.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:51]** And he used to own a mansion next to Dan Marino.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** And...

**[00:05:53 - 00:06:00]** And he's like, yeah, but I just like to travel on a Southwest flight because I'm kind of chintzy.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** I was like, oh, okay.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:06]** Is he the best new thing that you've discovered, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** He was a lot of fun.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** I enjoyed the conversations.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** But no, the best new thing I've got is my computer.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:11]** I'm not going to lie.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:14]** This thing has been phenomenal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** Welcome.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** I think I'll play the Apple startup sound.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** Because of Kevin's old computer.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** So it's nice to have one that's actually good.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** So congratulations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** I still have my old computer.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:27]** All I use it for is auto check-in for Southwest.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:34]** Because I can open the terminal, run it, and then darken the screen and ignore that computer altogether.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:36]** You know you could do that on your new computer too, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** No, it's not possible.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:39]** Isn't that the one that Will set up on your computer?

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:45]** Actually, it's harder on my new computer because it's like the x64 or whatever.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:49]** The Python script's not updated for Apple Silicon.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** Yeah, I've worked on it.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** I can do it on my new computer.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** It's just not as easily done.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:55]** Wow.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** Just gotta install UV.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:01]** And your old computer's just looking at your new computer with such jealousy.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:02]** I know.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** That poor thing.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** You had to just put it right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:05]** I've had it.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** And I say, thank you.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:09]** I, I appreciate this thing's been with me for 10 years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** So the laptop, he told you not to worry about.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** It got me through college.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:15]** Yeah.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** It's a good place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** Yeah.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** It's a 10 year old computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:19]** Yeah.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:22]** It got me through college and it got this podcast up and going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:26]** So when I first met you, you were together with him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** So I think I bought it like the week I met you.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:30]** Cause we had to, I bought it for class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:30]** Yeah.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** So it was a new relationship.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** It was a new relationship.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:33]** Yeah.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:38]** Will, Kelly, what's a new thing that you would recommend or that you've been digging?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** I got a sauna for my birthday.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** Dude, yo.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:44]** Well, that's dope.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** Like a personal size sauna?

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** Like a one man?

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** It's like a shower?

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** Nice.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:55]** I was imagining like a wooden structured one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:58]** Yeah, I mean, I want one of those like in...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:20]** joshua tree but yeah yeah that this works for j tree for my daily needs yeah that's dope sweet wow yeah i'm surprised you don't have like set it up in your office why would i set it up in my office he's actually in it right now right when you need to be in it you just pull it up zip it yeah when it's not your turn in combat you're like hey guys i'll be right back


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:29]** I imagine Will as like the Baron from Dune.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** Just like rising out of the floor.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** He's like, hey guys, I'll be right back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:39]** Floats up.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:41]** What about you, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** Uh...

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** I don't know, man.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:46]** All right.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** There's this thing called congee.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** It's like a good Chinese food.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:52]** Yeah.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** And I've been like... Congee?

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:56]** Yeah.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** I've been eating it a lot more recently.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** I order it.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** It's like a good breakfast food.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** Oh, congee.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:01]** Yeah.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:04]** You should check out congee if you haven't had it before.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** The Asian sort is really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:08]** That's what I like right now.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:08]** Yeah.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:11]** Have you had any good Oma rice since you were over there?


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:11]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:37]** yeah um i'd say other countries do omurice better than japan really that's surprising oh yeah for sure like japan is uh it was something i was very surprised about as well japan has like good quality food that's like what they're known for it's a it's very good and it's consistently good but the flavors are not as good as other places other other countries nearby have better flavors for sure yeah

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:40]** Japanese people will say, oh, but it's like a subtle thing.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:43]** Wait, so kanji is just like rice?

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Kanji is just like rice porridge?

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:46]** Yeah, it's like that.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:51]** But it's like you get like ham in it or like pieces of pork and like some other things.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** It's pretty delicious.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:53]** It's a comfort food.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** Yeah, try it out.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:18]** i will try out kanji and omurice when i'm there but i still have to say i still feel like omurice is it's like it's like watching a zit popping video just like oh you know just like it makes you the way the way you cut it you know just it's the favorite food of dr people you're not wrong but you're out of line john in taiwan you should try

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:45]** a conch okay is where you gotta try it okay i'm not sure if it's any good oh i need to try this omorice thing yeah it does look good once it's so bad once it's been opened right but until then omorice baltimore once it's blossomed yeah i don't know every time i watch it blossom it feels like i'm watching something i shouldn't be watching i know it does it really does experience and i'm just like but it's so delicious you can't help but dig in you can't help but just savor it yeah no yeah

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:50]** There are two things that I have been digging lately.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:56]** One is actually just an idea, just a thought, which is that your plan is not your emotions.

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:06]** So whatever your plan that you're trying to stick to or do, whatever it is, then you do it regardless of how you feel because it's a plan and your emotions don't have any input into that.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:09]** Obviously, there are a lot of caveats if you should change your plan, but...

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:25]** you know if you're like oh like i want to like like go work out you're like okay well i don't feel like it well you know you could like like it's still a plan that you've committed to even though you don't feel like it so that's it that's the thing i've been trying to practice when i'm tired you need to get some things done i thought you were talking about stuff

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:29]** You know, yeah, I changed it because that was the only thing I could think of.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:35]** The other thing that's also not stuff, so it doesn't fit into this thing, is that I'm a fan of hard pivots.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:39]** So I think we just hard pivot right in to the episode.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:41]** We're trying to get our banter down, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:45]** You've been heard, internet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:45 - 00:12:13]** you've been heard world congratulations finder you won for the next three weeks before we forgot our commitment to like exactly one banter that just goes off the rails i mean look do we go off the rails yeah is that awesome yeah will we do it again yeah will we do it this app will we do it about this banter no probably not unless we start talking about trains and then you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** Dude, don't.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:14]** Yeah.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** People on trains.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Not the people on trains.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** Will likes the trains themselves.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:19]** Oh, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:20]** That is true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** Oh, you're a train otaku?

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** Cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** Is that a thing?

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:25]** Train otaku?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:31]** Well, let's... You all were choo-chooing your way across the Varos landscape.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** Benny went to color bars at that point.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:34]** I think he's done.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** He didn't like my transition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:39]** That was a terrible joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** Sorry, that's my threshold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:44]** I don't... Stuff going off the rails.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:54]** Speaking of things going off the rails, your decision that no one will be at the dome and everything will be okay certainly went off the rails.

**[00:12:54 - 00:13:14]** as yeah who said that again john yeah i don't remember yeah it was someone it could have been a voice in the wind as you're as you roll down the window to throw out your trash because you're just littering yeah there's a train conductor yelling yeah yeah it's actually the train whistle it's safe no one's there yeah so

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:21]** You have finally met, though, let's be real, possibly, a friend.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** I use the term very loosely.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:28]** Because, at least in one episode, this is somebody who is not immediately threatening your lives.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:42]** Because after you've made your way across a hostile volcano moon, diverting herds of native lava striders with mating calls, watching the base that you spent a few days at explode,

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:48]** Piloting your steward cruisers, your stewards, over molten lava rivers.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** What the f***?

**[00:13:51 - 00:14:08]** Meeting this strange pair in the dome and discovering that not only were they prisoners, they were also desperately seeking to pass some test, belong, attend, go to this palace obscura.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:12]** Also, don't forget, this has been all in one day.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:37]** until a knock at the door in the middle of your sleep from old rudy maglin a local prison trophy hunter relentless in his pursuits and easy in his conversations this is your latest friend hopefully not to meet the same fate that many of your other friends have the ones yeah

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:50]** He's told you about Nix and Cairo, about his upbringing on the last call, and also about a mine nearby that may be another place of refuge for you, certainly with probably more than this dome can offer.

**[00:14:50 - 00:15:00]** And he's told you about two other android fugitives that he is looking for, Petey and Delamar, who are android abolitionist front members.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** I'm going to bring you guys back on Sirenscape.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:05]** Sorry, on Foundry 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** Thank you, Sirenscape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** By the way, thank you, Sirenscape.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** You're fantastic.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** Thank you, Foundry.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** Also, Hero Lab.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** I'm going to unpause here.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** You all were talking to Rudy.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** You're standing outside.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** It's dark.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:23]** The moon is still swelteringly hot, even with the sun down.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:30]** And you're standing next to these pools of bubbling oil in the desolate landscape.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:37]** Sherry, the Lava Strider, shuffles after Rudy shuffles her giant hooves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:47]** After Rudy has just said, yeah, so these two android abolitionist members, those are the only other ones that I'm looking for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:51]** Kind of takes a step back, stretches out.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** He's large.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** He's like 10 feet tall.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:55]** Stretches out his giant paws.

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:02]** You can just see he has these like massive thighs, like larger than your waist.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** Just a huge dude, but so nice.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** And his ears kind of perk up.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** You see him look around.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:11]** He's always taking note of what's going on in the environment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:15]** Is there anything else that I can help you for with?

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** Sorry, five.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** Looks at Bernice.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** I can help you five with.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:26]** I was going to take a look at your vehicles here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:30]** Kind of looks back over at him, thinking about what he's going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:40]** These androids that you mentioned, were they involved with whatever Cairo and Nix were incarcerated for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:42]** Let me look.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** Scrolls through.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:48]** No, seems like they came from Rose Light.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:55]** Whether that is the same, it's not listed here.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:57]** It's about all I know.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:02]** Maybe they were cellmates or prison block mates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:06]** Who knows how they... I wonder if there is some connection between them all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** Perhaps.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** I don't know.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:11]** That's not my job to figure out.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:14]** But you look like you got a thinking mind on you there.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** Rick, right?

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** Yes.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:16]** Rick 17?

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** Sorry.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:18]** 19.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:21]** That's right.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:46]** all right well look uh i'll be quiet as quiet as i can start gonna work on these vehicles good talking with y'all you're not stewards but uh i wish you the best actually hang on got something reaches into one of the many folds in his like technical hide armor

**[00:17:47 - 00:18:11]** then pulls out this little square chip shit let's call it presses a little button and like kind of how like a line light it it lights up around the perimeter of the square with this green it flashes green and then blue and then purple and then red and then flashes red a few times and then he pressed it again


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** Here you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** Stand in front of yours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:18]** This is a personal emergency beacon.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:26]** So it only works with, you know, the beacons only work based on their standard range, 100 miles or whatever.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:32]** But if you plug it in to your ship or this police cruiser, it'll adapt to whatever range you're in.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:36]** If you need me for anything, feel free.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:37]** Thanks, Rudy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:39]** That's mighty kind of you.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** We'll be sure to do so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:51]** Yeah, well, you know, I know what it's like to be out here on your own, trying to cobble things together and get someplace when you're really in the shit.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:52]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:57]** But at the end of the day, you got to rely on your community.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** Happy to help out when I can.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** All right.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:06]** Well, I will see y'all when I see ya.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:10]** Kind of takes a step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:12]** unless there's anything else you all wanted to ask or say.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:20]** Starts walking over to the cars, reaches up, grabs some tools from Sherry, the lava strider.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:21]** What do you all do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** I think Rick's going to take his lead and go back to sleep.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:25]** Yeah.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** Trying to get rested up.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Oh, yeah, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** This is the middle of the night, right?

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:30]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:33]** This here's this beautiful wish come true.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:35]** Here's his wish to sleep.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** All right.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** He's going to go to sleep as well.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:40]** Don't forget, Rick, I have the bunk.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** So I'm just going to go to this bunk right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:45]** Dr. OK is going to do the same.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** OK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** Wait, Hears is supposed to be on watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** No, I didn't get my full sleep.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** Did he get interrupted or no?

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:53]** We got interrupted by Rudy is what happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:56]** You woke him for his two hours of watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:58]** No, that's not how it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** That's exactly what happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:02]** You were waking him up when that happened.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:06]** Well, now he's going to go, I want, all right, fine.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** I'll be up for however long and then I'm going to go back to bed.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:09]** Right.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:13]** So I guess Hears will just awkwardly talk to Rudy, like look at him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:17]** Do you help with repairing the vehicle?

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:24]** Because right now... Right now, Colin... You were going to repair the other vehicle.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:24]** Yeah.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:28]** One is at 29 of 50 and the other is at 18 of 50.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:28]** I'm sorry.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:32]** I was just so impressed with Rudy's awesomeness that I forgot what I was here to do.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** I'm going to work on the other.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:39]** What did you say they were again?

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:39]** Stewards.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** There was a nickname you had for them, John.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** Stoosers.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:44]** Stoosers.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:47]** I'm going to work on the other Stooser while Rudy's working on the other one.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:49]** Sorry, the other what?

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:49]** The what?

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:50]** The stoozer.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:53]** That's what we've affectionately called them.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** That's our little name too.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** Cool.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:56]** Yeah.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** It's not weird at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:02]** All right.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Sherry likes it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** Sherry, just pause.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:06]** Giant feet.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:09]** Here's is tempted to do the noise, but it's not going to turn out well.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:11]** You don't want that smoke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:14]** You don't want that.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** No, I don't.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:39]** so dr okay rick 19 and uh and uh colin head inside to sleep yeah cool okay here's if you're gonna work on the vehicle rudy's gonna walk over to the one that that you were in unless you want to work on that one and i'll need you to give me an engineering check right engineering how many upbs did you use last time dr okay do you remember


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:40]** not offhand.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:44]** I think I removed it, though.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:47]** And didn't I roll super well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:51]** You did roll, so there were some that you didn't need.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:53]** I just didn't write it down, so if you have it.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** We can just track however much we do this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:01]** Okay, here's... I hope the UPVs help, because I only rolled a 15 this time on engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** Got it.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:07]** Okay.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:07]** Well...

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:14]** You can make repairs because you failed pretty close to the DC.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** It's a DC-16.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:19]** So you can increase it by five.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:27]** So right now it costs, you can repair up to eight hit points, right, of the vehicle.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:34]** And when you do that, then you spend 10 UPBs per point of damage.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:36]** So you can increase that by five.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** So you can increase it by half.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:44]** So right now, if you want, you can still repair it, but you'll spend 40 more UPBs.

**[00:22:44 - 00:23:09]** spent 160 upb okay and we had 500 that we found yeah you found 500. so well yeah i'll spend it then okay so you'll spend it okay so that's 120 and yours goes if if you want to double click on the one for colin and rick you can add eight to that rudy all right meanwhile succeeds


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:39]** and he is able to increase dr k and hears this do you talk to rudy during this time sure why not you don't have to i'm just asking if you do what are you going to he's not he's not an awkward person he's like he's like kevin and and uh and and vinnie he just wants to talk to random people all the time except rudy is like cool so he already checks out he already offered him gum yeah exactly he already already passed the gum rudy

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** I'd love some gum.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:42]** Thanks.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** Oh, I thought, oh yeah, here you go.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** This is a, I smoke a lot.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:49]** So, you know, this voice didn't come from nowhere.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:55]** So I got to get some gum to, you know, you know, clear my mouth or whatever they say.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** Sherry wants some too.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:22]** oh okay he just kind of nervously looks at her he's had so many weird experiences with lava striders over the last you know not that many hours ago so she heard from afar he kind of like delicately places it in her mouth yeah she eats the whole pack oh great well thanks shane rapper and all just like yeah yeah demolishes it they're like camels


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** Yeah.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:30]** So you currently have three 60 that you've spent in this hour.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** So you have another one 40 left.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:41]** So that's enough for one or two of us currently, unless you all want to spend more of your own credits to like repair the cars and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:41]** Right.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:46]** It looks like Dr. OK and Here's This Car needs some more love.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:49]** I guess like Rudy is tapped out on his contributions to the repairs.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:49]** Is that correct?

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:50]** He can do it again if he wants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** He's still working on it.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** Yeah.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** Yeah, Rudy, why don't I help you with this?

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:55]** Yeah, thanks.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** For fun reasons.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:57]** Sure.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:57]** Come over.

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:58]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:25]** so you got a nice set of tools here thanks uh well it's slowly been accumulated across uh time you know what i'm saying it's been picked up here and there that one that one was from a dead kasatha that i actually found dead i don't know what happened you're emphasizing you found him dead isn't like you didn't kill him right right you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:27]** I'm not trying to kill him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** Just found him.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:31]** Yeah, it was weird.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:35]** He had been laying there for, I don't know, the past three days.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:36]** Shot in the back of the head.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:38]** Someone else got to him first.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** When did this happen?

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:41]** No, it was a long time ago.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:42]** A long time ago.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:45]** Anyway, can you pass me that spanner wrench right there?

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** Yeah, here you go.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:47]** Do you aid him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:50]** Yeah, I aid him.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:50]** Okay.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** Do you get a 10 or above?

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** I'm going to try.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** Yeah, I do.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:54]** Okay.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:57]** Is there anything else you can tell us?

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** Yeah, what's up?

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:04]** Is there anything else you can tell us about this place?

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:08]** I know there are some factions here, is what we've encountered.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:12]** We've encountered some weird stuff, but obviously there's stewards.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** Is there anything else we need to be aware of?

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:17]** Because we're going to make our way to Terrapin, like we were saying earlier.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** We just want to be careful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:23]** Yeah, well, you're going to have to figure out how you're going to get down the...

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** The cliffs.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** Shouldn't be too hard on these.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** They're mostly up to snuff now.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:32]** I would maybe drop by that mine.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:38]** They might... The community there might have a little more than's here.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:40]** You know, you can get a little bit more rest.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** See if there's anything there that you might need.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** Obviously, there's some lava striders.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** If you need to...

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:54]** If you need to hop a ride, if you damage any of these, what do you call them?

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Bruisers?

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** Yes, stewards.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** Yeah.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** Yep, yep.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:06]** If you damage it, then, yeah, you can always hop on a lava strider.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** I would offer sherry, but I'll be with sherry.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** So, let's see.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:17]** And just, you know, I would say keep an eye out for anything flying.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:20]** There's some strange things.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** Like an organic creature of some kind?

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:29]** Yeah, just there have been some reports lately of flocks of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:58]** creatures that have been flying around i haven't seen this one but apparently there's some sort of a dragon i think they're kind of young yeah so just keep your eyes peeled up and down you know don't just don't just get lost on the horizon here besides the mines and terrapin we're determined to go is there any is there anywhere else we should check out uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** it sounds like your goal is to get to Terrapin.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:07]** So if your goal is to get to Terrapin, I'd say those are probably the only things that are going to stand in your way.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** If you want to change that.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:11]** I don't know, Sherry, what do you think?

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:19]** Sherry's like, there is a nice little oasis randomly.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:22]** If you wanted to swing by there, take a little dip.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** It's nice.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** Sometimes I go there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** Okay.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:29]** Would you mind just throwing it on my map real quick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Sherry will point to where it is.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** He turns back to finish repairing the car.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** Sherry just looks over at you.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** Sherry, just chill.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:43]** And then Sherry literally takes out her tongue and goes bleh.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:47]** And leaves a giant wet spot on your datapad where the map is.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:53]** And it roughly translates to a 50 square mile area where there's probably no...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:57]** It's so cool that even his mount has become cool.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Yeah, that's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:06]** Hey, so I was able to add in just a couple little extra support here to some of your shocks.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:11]** Because I know you're going to be taking a lot of hits going down that slope there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:15]** That's a pretty good cook.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** You cooked that up pretty good on the fly.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** I've never seen it done that well before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:22]** So mechanically, you had 140 left.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:28]** And with your aid, and because Rudy rolled well, then I was thinking, you let me know if you want to do this.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:32]** You'd spend the rest of your 140, but you would double the amount that you could do in an hour.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:35]** So you would gain 16 HP instead of 8.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** So you'd be at 42 of 50.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** Does that sound good?

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** Sure.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** Yeah, it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:41]** Cool.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:42]** That's where we're at.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Yeah.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:44]** Great.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:50]** Well, I think these cruisers, as you call them, are pretty ship-shape.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Should be good to go.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** Slaps a paw on it.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** It's good to meet you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** It just makes like a giant dent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** Yeah, it's good to meet you.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** Does two points of damage.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:58]** You'd be safe now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:02]** Yeah, it doesn't do any damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:04]** All right.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** Take care, Hears.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:06]** Six out of paw.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** Yeah, Hears is definitely going to shake his paw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Pleasure, Rudy.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** Pleasure's all mine.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** You five stay safe out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:21]** Hops on and just ambles off into the night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:25]** Here goes the most magnificent man I've seen in some time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** This is the world's most interesting person.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** Yeah, he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:32]** The universe's most interesting person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:34]** Move over, Doseki Sky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** Yeah.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:38]** To here's, it's literally everybody.

**[00:30:57 - 00:31:05]** He just kind of leans against, like, he pulls out another ciggy, leans against, like, the dome and kind of looks at the cars and waits.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:10]** Kind of looks at the sad, dead corpse of, I can't even remember her name anymore.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** Oh, she's not there.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:12]** He dead.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** Took her.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** Put her in a body bag.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:20]** Just sees the pile of blood going all the way into the distance.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:36]** interesting day well it's probably about time to wake up uh who is it that i want to wake up again probably rick oh no colin i guess sure if nothing else happens he's gonna do that yeah um he can't go inside

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** He locked himself out.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:42]** The last thing was that he locked me out of my own f***ing dome.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Okay, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** It's not locked.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** I can't go in.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** I'm stuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:48]** The door's narrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** Let me just fix that.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:53]** No, I can't get in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:53]** I'm serious.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:57]** Here's failed his engineering check to open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:57]** He really did.

**[00:31:58 - 00:31:59]** All right.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** Let me just do this.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** What is happening?

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Is this better?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:04]** Hold on.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:06]** God, it might be up here on my own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:13]** I'm just imagining the scene from the Simpsons movie where Cletus keeps bouncing off the barrier because he can't get into the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** All right.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** I'm still stuck, by the way.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:21]** I'm just shouting this into the void right now because I don't have any friends to talk to because I can't get inside the dome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:24]** Try opening it now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:24]** Don't soundproof.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:28]** I can't do shit.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** Okay, there we go.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** God dang.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:30]** All right.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** Hey, Bernice.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:35]** Don't tell anyone about what just happened.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:39]** Bernice was watching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** Luckily for Hears, we were all asleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:42 - 00:33:08]** yeah that's true that was embarrassing um colin who has all who does he remember has slept um who has not already taken a shift because i can't remember i'm pretty sure it's colin because he he is inept at both computers and engineering and so like his only purpose is to just wait colin wakey wakey no no

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:40]** Yeah, thanks.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** Wake me up if you need something, man.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:47]** Wake me up when the watch time ends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:50]** Colin, you are out on watch?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** Yeah, but I can't open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:59]** Dude, what the... I increased the door's area and I reduced the wall area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** It's not the door area.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** It's that I can't click on the door.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:03]** Like, it's not a door on my lair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** Yeah, you can't click on it either.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** That's another thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:09]** So, like, I can move through it if it's open, but I can't click on the door to open it.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** It's still under fog of war as well.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Yeah, that's also true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** Well, that's lighting.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** Um, that's lighting from inside.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** That's not fucking work.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:17]** That's really weird.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:17]** Okay.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** All right.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:19]** Cool.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** Oh, I see why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** Okay.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:32]** So Colin posts up outside the door and just like, let's the gentle glow of the oozing oil soothe him from his restlessness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:33]** Okay.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** Not much happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** It's quiet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:39]** And here's doesn't tell you about the dragons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** Right.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:46]** In my head, I formulated the sentence.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** He keeps an eye out for dragons, but then I was like, he doesn't know about dragons.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:50]** So no, just watching oil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:57]** The time passes as slowly as the oil bubbles.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:57]** Two hours pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:59 - 00:34:59]** It's quiet.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** You're good.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Cool.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** I think that's last watch, isn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** No, I haven't gotten yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:19]** Oh, uh, he like walks back in and gently shakes Rick awake and it's Rick's eyes just kind of open and he turns to you and nods and then he stands up and grabs his gun and walks out.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** Doesn't like have to say anything.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** He knows what's happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** Okay.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:47]** rick you are out there for the sunrise as the sun breaks across the volcano moon horizon anything you're thinking in particular you don't nothing happens the vehicles are sitting there quietly the wind blows whatever stalwart vegetation hardy vegetation is there in the ground and just a soft bubble


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:50]** I mean, he's keeping an eye out.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:54]** He's being very vigilant and monitoring the area.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:57]** He's probably even pacing around the dome a little too.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:07]** But he's really just contemplating those two androids.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:15]** Because Rex has actually never met someone else that's a member of the AAF personally.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:18]** since he's left train.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:19]** So he's curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** Curious.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:28]** That thought lingers as I think the three of you who are inside wake up.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** New day has dawned.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** I needed that.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** He just walks outside.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:39]** Good morning.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** Yeah, good morning, man.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:54]** The mines that Rudy mentioned earlier, I think... I don't know if he said anything about who's running them, but sometimes, as you might be aware, enslaved androids run them.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:58]** But I don't know if that would happen in any place where stewards are nearby.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:03]** I don't really remember or know much about the politics of...

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:08]** of all of that, but if we run into them, I just want to let you know that might happen.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:11]** It's not an uncommon thing, unfortunately.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** Oh, I'm quite aware of that.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** Thank you.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** Alright.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** Also, there are dragons.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Just let me know.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** He just walks away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:26]** He walks towards the car.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** Just starts blasting some music.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:36]** Don't forget that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:40]** Cool.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Oh, you guys wake up.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:44]** Maybe there's some MREs.

**[00:37:45 - 00:38:00]** cold cold uh congee really disgusting looking omurice yeah gross and uh yeah do you guys want to keep you want to head out you got anything else you want to do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:05]** We just need to decide on if we're stopping by the mines first before.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:08]** I guess we need to decide that as a group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** I think it's on the way, right?

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Yeah, I think it's on the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:18]** Well, let's just make sure Colin and Doctor are okay or cool with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Yeah, why not?

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:22]** Maybe we can hitch a ride there too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Who knows?

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:28]** Might be able to collect some supplies or maybe even run into a shop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:55]** for true hello hello oh please please yes i thought i was hoping it was going to go why did i say that if that happens we definitely need to go to the mines i'm always voting for snake boy all shopkeepers in this game are snake people that's just yes i'm saying they're the moogles they're the moogles of our universe


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:55 - 00:39:14]** i have a sister uh colin you had your hand up uh i did i was gonna ask because i can't remember and i obviously can't read um what did we ever like figure out what was on the computer like that we rescued from the oil okay cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:25]** Yeah, it was because it showed us that Cairo and Nix were sending signals off to Roselight to a refrigerator or a smart toaster in Roselight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:25]** Right.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:26]** That makes sense.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** Smart air fryer.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:27]** Cool.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** Yep.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** Awesome.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:31]** Yeah, let's get the f*** out of here.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:35]** To the mines.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:36]** You shut the door on the dome.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:38]** What?

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** Bloop.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** An interesting place.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** Different than maybe you were all expecting.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:44]** I'm going to activate.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** Let's go back to the Varos map.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:50]** Overland travel.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:51]** It is she.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:57]** Still about 400 miles to Terrapin Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** So wait, Terrapin Station is on a cliff?

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** That's what Rudy said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** He said it was built.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:03]** No, there's a cliff in the middle of it.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** So we have to navigate cliffs to get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** Yeah, there are.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:09]** Yeah, this big dark gash is a cliff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Dark thing.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** Yeah, you all are.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:15]** What I remember is that you made it sound like it was on the cliffs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:20]** It does look like there's like a chasm on the way to that general direction as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** But yeah.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** He did say that it was built into a cliff.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:28]** And there is a... You are on a plateau, right?

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** You're on a plateau of cliffs.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** And you can see like a scar in the middle.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:39]** You can see how the cliffs separate this plateau from the plains below.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:46]** You can see a couple lava waterfalls that run down there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:48]** And where is this mine located?

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** We don't see it on the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** No, you don't see it on the map quite yet.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:56]** He said, start heading out and look for the red light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:58]** Where's the spit circle?

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:01]** Oh, that was for the Oasis.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:01]** Spit circle on our map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** That was for the Oasis.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:05]** Oh, okay.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:11]** Yeah, she also spit in the general area of where that would be.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:15]** So it was roughly around this crater here.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** I'm pinging it here on the map.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:19]** It was in that kind of... The mines.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:47]** well that's where it is uh because i forget her name she licked this that's where we gotta go sherry yeah okay let's be careful with this chasm though you all hop in put on the sweet futuristic interior dash just start cruising anything different that you guys are listening to today


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:48 - 00:42:17]** books on tape books on tape this is still like kevin's harry potter reading yeah yeah it's the second chapter i think i think colin throws on some have we really gotten that far some epic like um oh my goodness i've lost the artist there you go kendrick no uh no kendrick is for the ride back for sure um uh oh what is it kendrick gets for hell


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** Two steps from hell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** I don't know this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:23]** I've got to find the artist's name now.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** Anyway, don't let me stop the game.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** I'll interject it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** No, I think we should stop the game.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:30]** I think we should just stop the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:37]** I think we should just go back into banter mid-episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:39]** Yeah, the artist should go two steps from hell.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** Should we start a mid-ep banter?

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** It's appropriate.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** Just for Finder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:47]** Absolutely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:48 - 00:43:11]** uh what's a topic that he would like uh wrestling yeah oh literally the worst idea we've ever had if it was about wrestling would finder approve it unclear one of our most loyal supporters we love you all right you start cruising and after a while


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:15]** It's that feeling that the horizon is not rising up to meet you.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:24]** Because as you're getting closer, you start to realize, and you pull up in your imagination machine.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:33]** Think about you pulling up to the edge of a 1,000-foot cliff.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** It's huge.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:36 - 00:44:03]** like you all for a cross deep you have to go down the planes are a thousand feet below you you can see there's 304 meters for our uh non-american friends yep yep thank you for that or as the brits say it's like 700 kerfuffle things or whatever they use for like any kind of measurement i thought that that was us i thought like a thousand feet's like you know

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:28]** 500 refrigerators no the brits are worse because they're like oh you weigh 50 stone and no one knows what the f**k that means by the way british people all right whatever slugs how are we going to get down slugs so it's a good question it's a good question you are looking out you can see pretty far away you can see all these craters and you think you can see in the haze


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:40]** of the fiery volcano, you think you can see some sort of man-made station still about 350, 75 miles away.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:50]** You can see a light glisten every once in a while through the harsh, like, you know, acidic fog, ascetic fog.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** Is it ascetic?

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** The cliffs.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:53]** I don't know.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:54]** Let me know.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:57]** To get down,

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:17]** can do a couple things you can either climb without the use of the vehicles it's a lot more checks it's a little bit easier no dc15 athletics or if you want to get down in the vehicles it can take

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:20]** You would essentially do a controlled fall.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:23]** So you would have less checks.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** They'll be a bit harder.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** They'll be piloting checks.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:39]** One of you, the other one who's not driving, can aid in order to kind of help steer some of the little mini stabilizers, you know, like the maneuvering, like the hover jets.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** You can kind of shift some power.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:47]** Maybe you get out, you look down, peer over the edge, just face the fear of heights that you might have.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:50]** And you see that there are times where there's like an escarpment.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** Is that right?

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:54]** Where like you can just kind of nose dive down and right.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** And then you hit these like plateaus area.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:01]** What is the gravity on this planet?

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Normal.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:04]** So like 9.9 meters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:06]** 9.89 meters per second squared.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:06]** Yeah.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** 9. whatever it is.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** 9.81.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:11]** What would be like the atmospheric terminal velocity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:12]** It's a good question.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:16]** It is a thicker... How many checks are we going to have to do?

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:18]** How many checks are you going to have to do?

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:20]** Do you want to... Let me think.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:24]** With this, it'll take about three rounds, I'll say.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:26]** A lot less.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:29]** But a lot less than climbing down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** It's a thousand feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** That's only 1.5 furlongs.

**[00:46:35 - 00:46:36]** Ah, thank you.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:36]** That's it.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:40]** How many clicks or nautical miles will that be?

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:42]** So here's the thing.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:44]** You are in a controlled fall.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:48]** So failing means that there will be some damage to your vehicle.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:52]** There may also be damage to you depending on how hard you hit the vehicle.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:58]** If you're jostling around, getting slammed in, crushing things.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:25]** think it's worth it because it's gonna be weird traveling the majority left of all of this without vehicles yeah also like if you fall just slipping in a climb check like yeah how many you said you're gonna do more yeah to climb down is slower right so so you would have to do they're slightly easier because you're trusting in your own strengths don't we have like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:28]** I have a Kasathan Microchord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:31]** Isn't Microchord the armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:34]** I think it makes all kinds of things, including armor.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:37]** It's like that strong of a butt lightweight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:41]** I thought I got like a... Yeah, it's an outfit, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:41]** No.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** Wait, I'm looking at the wrong thing then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:58]** I love that the conversation in Dr. OK and Here's His Car is like this academic, like, OK, if we get out and we measure the terminal velocity and, you know, navigate our way down and Colin just turns to Ricky's like, we ball for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:22]** so someone in each car needs to be doing the full piloting check and someone will be doing the assist well i'm pretty sure doctor you're better at piloting and when i'm assisting i can use engineering because you're talking about redistributing power and stuff like that i'm guessing i could use engineering computers no it's no it's just a piloting


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:26]** I'm trying to see if you can do piloting untrained.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** I'm trained in it.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** I just.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** Yeah.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:29]** I don't think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** Colin, are you trained?

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:32]** Oh, I see.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:36]** We might have to change up the roster a little bit.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:36]** Right.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** That's what I'm thinking.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:39]** I'm just trying to look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** Can you use it trained?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** Can you do what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** You can use it untrained.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** It makes sense.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** You can drive a vehicle if you're not trained.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:46]** I guess.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** If you don't have a license like Finder does.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:52 - 00:49:00]** We should still... For our audio listeners, Colin and Rick just did rock, paper, scissors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:29]** to figure out who's piloting down the cliff so he's piloting all righty i love this you're about to descend okay dr okay and here's sorry uh who is piloting dr okay i'll pilot the doctor okay okay you guys are going down i'm going to be keeping track here one last question before we start our roles you going down face first or first probably face first


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:47]** first just we go aussie style bro front front just not backing up how are you going to stabilize like how are you going to see if there's if there's involved i'm going face first although rick is piloting i guess he should answer


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:49]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:52]** I figured I'd just jump off and then try to land it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** Yeah, just trust.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Just trust.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:58]** Full thrust at the end, you're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:04]** If you want to take the wheel, the truck in the sand just like... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:11]** You spend three hours building a ramp just collecting a lot of dirt just to get a bunch of air and just take off.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:13]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:37]** all right this is crazy you're about to drive down a thousand foot cliff control the fall best of lawful good knievel for lawful good knievel all righty first roll you edge it over it's like it's like a roller coaster

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** Awesome, awesome.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:43]** Boom, takes off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** That's the only way to do something like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** It's true, it's true.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:59]** In your mind, you feel, imagine that you feel your characters, like that feeling when your center of gravity moves forward and you are facing nearly 90 degrees down in a controlled fall, trying to stabilize.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** Give me that first roll, Dr.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:03]** O.K., and that first aid, here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:07]** He's got a f***ing nat 20 motha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** Get out of here.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Nice.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Keeps calm.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** It says yeet.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** Keeps calm.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:15]** I love it.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:21]** Okay, so that is a natural 20 for a total of... Did here's assist?

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** No, I didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** 27.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:28]** I was so taken aback by you going like full speed ahead.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Yeah.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** He's like, oh God.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** He didn't have time to prepare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:32]** Right, right, right.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:34]** You're like, okay, here we go.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** All right, that...

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** Here we go!

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:48]** A success as you successfully maneuver the vehicle nimbly and you land maybe 300, 350 feet down.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:58]** You find a plateau after what takes 10, 20 seconds of you sheer terror in Hears' eyes as you are just...

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:15]** white knuckling it rock playing whatever's playing white tentacle white tentacling it there's some juice that's starting to get to drip down the edge of the steering wheel and you are just you come to a stop and you're on a precarious edge but you're good


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:41]** you're good rick 19 calling you just saw dr okay here's go over you don't know what happens what are you doing do you go well i think rick was just about like he had gotten out looked at the cliff calculated like his best path got in the car and was like prepping himself to go and then dr okay wait boom and rick is still outside the car you're like oh yeah i rolled a 13.

**[00:52:42 - 00:53:02]** roll the 13. with a plus eight uh wait so call it successfully 21. no no i rolled a five plus eight for total oh goodness oh i thought it was 13 plus eight so it's a 15. you know how we consistently up vehicle rules


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:26]** nothing changes okay uh cool 15 plus 2 so wait no 13 plus 2 for 15 13 plus 2 uh okay tell me what you all are thinking as you head down and feel the vehicle start to shift as you're being slammed back and forth

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** Solid.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** Love it.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:28]** Okay.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Awesome.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** Good, good, good.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:30]** Good, good, good.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:31]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:37]** In the audio, it's going to be beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:37]** Yeah.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** I'm going to love editing that.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** I'm going to love editing that.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:41]** That's going to be awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:43]** It's going to be one solid beep.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** I'm thinking beep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:56]** No, Colin's taking stock of the head and neck trauma he's going to have to treat at the bottom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:02]** You all, I'm going to say this, you cannot control that first part of the fall.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:08]** And you actually, as soon as Dr. Okay adheres, you hit that cliff.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:14]** Not five or ten seconds later, you see their car in front of you, like, keep going past you.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:19]** And you're only barely able to stabilize it, like, 25 or 50 feet below you.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** As your vehicle, I can't believe it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** I can't believe I'm saying this.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:27]** Your vehicle takes 37 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** What the f***?

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** 37?

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** Is that even... Is it still running?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** We have, what, one hit plus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** You guys are sitting on that cliff.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:44]** You just hear...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** Oh, man.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:49]** And Rick and Colin, you take eight points of damage.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:51]** Oof.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:51]** Oh, my God.

**[00:54:51 - 00:55:03]** Just from the jostle, the sheer force of trying to keep your cool and the G-force against your neck and your shoulders as you're leaning against the seatbelt and everything.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** It's rough on your body.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** That is round one.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:09]** So how much health do we have left on our car?

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:13]** Let me bring those vehicles over here.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:16]** Let me bring them over here so we can do that.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** I don't think we had that much.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:19]** I don't.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:21]** Yeah.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:21]** Okay.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** Car shadows apart and then we're just free falling.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:26]** I don't know if you can take another fall like that.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Wow, these are huge.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:29]** I'm going to put them off to the side.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** They're massive on the map here.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** The scale is off.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:34]** You all can keep track here.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** Well, we don't have a problem anymore.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:37]** Now we can just run over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** Wait, how much damage did we take?

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:38]** 35?

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:40]** 37.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:42]** We had 37 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:44]** We had 37 points, but we have a hardness of 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:53]** Right, so after that many... After 7 HP, or 7 points of damage, you then take... 30?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** Yeah.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:55]** Cool.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:57]** So we have 7.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** Woof.

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** I don't know that you can survive another fall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** Where's Rudy?

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:06]** Rudy!

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** We need your help!

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** Get the beacon.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:08]** Get the beacon.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:09]** Call him down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:11]** Rick is like, no, we're fine.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:15]** And he's trying to engage the beacon with his leg so nobody sees.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:17]** Yeah, everything's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** Rudy flies with Sherry.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:23]** It's like taking the eagles from Mordor.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:26]** No, it's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** Alright, this is a tense situation, Dr.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:30]** O.K., here, as you see them go past.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** In front of you.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** What do you do?

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:33]** Keep going.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** You keep going.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** Yeah.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:35]** Full throttle.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:37]** Full throttle.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:39]** Cowabunga.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:41]** We gotta meet at the bottom one way or another.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** That's true.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** What's that roll, Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:46]** O.K.?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** I got an 18 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:49]** For 25.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:50]** 25.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:54]** Here's do you assist?

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** Yes, I do assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** 27.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:00]** 27.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:01]** Go.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** That's a success.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** That's another success.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** Neither of them are pilots and it's obvious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:14]** You can try and maybe switch if you all are able to land in the same area, roughly, depending on how well you succeed or not.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** You can try and climb up or climb down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:17]** Operative word being roughly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:43]** i mean we ought to keep one car in good shape just have somebody hold on top that's true we could just switch rick and colin maybe we can tow the other one they fit three ghost ride the hovercraft okay rick can ride on the top and then like colin can be inside it's good all righty what do you do rick and colin they come flying past you with like dr k's like zen the whole time

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:49]** In fact, he and Hears are having a normal conversation at a normal volume.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** Rick and Colin, what do you do?

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:57]** You're stuck on probably, I'd say, one of the narrowest cliff ledges that you've seen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:06]** I just imagine the audio track is like Vivaldi and then Ace of Spades.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:06]** Yes.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** I need to edit it with that.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:11]** When it's Dr. Kane, it's Vivaldi.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:15]** And then when it's Rick and Colin, it's like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** It's four seasons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:18]** Yeah, it's four seasons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:48]** do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:55]** You all end up on the same cliffside, a little slow, as Dr. K hears.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:59]** We just suck at rolling.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:02]** You just suck at rolling.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:12]** I'm picturing a shot from like a few miles away where you all are very small and there's just a clean smoke trail from Dr. Okay and Here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:17]** And then this like wild, erratic vehicle from Rick and Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** Couple barrel rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:22]** Yeah, and then there's just the quiet bubble of lava in the background.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:25]** Just you all trying to make your way down a thousand foot cliff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** We are at...

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:30]** Round three, the final round.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:34]** You are 250 feet above the ground.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:36]** I'm just going to jump.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** You're just going to say, f*** it.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** Doctor, okay.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** What?

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** I'm going.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** And here, you're going.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** You're going.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:42]** Send it.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:43]** What did you get?

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:46]** I got a 14 on the die for 21.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:49]** Here's assists.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:50]** For 21.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:54]** No, 23 with the assist.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** 23 with the assist.


## Speaker_0

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:20]** as you're coming down there's one last rock that you were not expecting your eyes are trying to adjust while looking at nearly 90 degrees you're trying to gauge the distance with the ground that looks the same as the wall and you just catch on something it throws you off really quick your vehicle takes eight points of damage dr okay and here's and you all take two points of damage

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:45]** it throws you into the side of the vehicle get some bruises so eight points of damage to your vehicle two i uh eight with the hardness meaning that you'll take one point of damage and you all take two uh one point to the to the to the vehicle itself okay we didn't take the hardness into account for the lava stuff no we miscalculated that but it's too late it's fine

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]** Rick and Colin, round three.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:50]** What happens?

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:52]** What do you all do?

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** Two points stamina, right?

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:55]** Well, I guess we just got to go.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:58]** Wait, Kev, before you roll it.

**[01:00:59 - 01:00:59]** Full send?

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:00]** Full send.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:02]** Before you tell us what happened, Kev.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:04]** That's our game.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** Don't say it, Kev.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** Don't you say it.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** Don't you say it.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:11]** Don't tell anybody what you rolled.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:14]** You just keep that crazy look on your face.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:16]** You do not tell us what you rolled.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:22]** We'll find out next week if you survived your crazy descent down a thousand foot cliff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:24]** I mean, it's the last 250 feet.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:25]** You know, it's fine.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:27]** It's not that easy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:29]** What is the fall damage at 250?

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:30]** Just curious.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]** Just like for a friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** Just ask.
