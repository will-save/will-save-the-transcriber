## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:21]** Hello friends.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:21]** Welcome to my channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:27]** What's up everybody, it's episode 1 of MDM Will Save the Pocket!

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** We'll save!

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:28]** We'll save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:42]** I just had to take a drink to quench my thirst for all 150 episodes because I didn't drink for 149 episodes.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** I finally took a drink.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** I feel so good.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** I am John Swan.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** Yeah, no, it's fine.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:53]** I'm your time looping GM and I'm joined by my fellow time travelers here.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** Vinny.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:57]** I'm joined by my fellow time travelers, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** And Will.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:00]** I'm joined by Will.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:05]** Will actually appeared in episode one to say, hey, this is me from 150.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** He just dumped it.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** If you go back and play it backwards, that's what happens.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:14]** Feels good to be here at the 150 mountaintop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:35]** you know yeah it's nice to look at all the valleys is it is it a peak it's nothing it's all downhill from here no no no no this is like the this is like camp one you know okay this is like the first peak yeah yeah so you're gonna be a little bit of a dip after this but we're gonna is it like everest where that's because you can't have a peak without that you need you need like a heat it's like a ball


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:45]** Yeah, it's like a very slight peak because I don't want to say that when we're looking ahead to things like Liberation of Locust 1 and call Kelly's stuff a valley.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** That's not good.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** We could call Severance a valley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** Why are we putting this out into the universe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** I'm not like a... That's what I'm saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:54]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:58]** It's not even there in the universe.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:58]** It's not there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:59 - 00:02:59]** It's not there.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:04]** I just want to let everyone know ahead of time, before Locust happens, okay?

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:05]** How bad it's going to be?

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** This is everyone else's fault.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Just a warning?

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** So then, like, all right.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** And with that, we have some banter to get to, everybody.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** You guys are on Discord.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** Let's go get to the banter.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:13]** I'm just saying.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:16]** They voted for me to do it out of their complete lack of wisdom.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:19]** So if it happens... Wait, we voted for that?

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:21]** I thought you volunteered.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** No, the willing did.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** The willing voted.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** I am bringing up the banner in the background here.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** So it's your fault.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** Three years ago.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:28]** Yeah, it's your fault.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:28]** All of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:35]** We got some banter to cap off this incredible start to 150 as we're looking ahead.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:39]** This banter brought to you by Tuckum and Kyle.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** How you doing?

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** Thank you.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:43]** It's going to be a real heartfelt.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Please don't make me cry again.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:47]** No, but it is another food one.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** More food.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:54]** And let's try and cue this on the quicker side.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:54]** We'll see.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:57]** What food are you bringing to a food fight?

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** Simple question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** Simple question.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** But good question.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:01]** Chili.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** I think it depends on where the food fight is.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:09]** Because if you're going to like the Pasadena Rose Parade, then you got to bring tortillas and marshmallows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** I feel like there's only one right answer.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:13]** Well, banana cream pie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** Oh, yes.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:15]** Tastes good.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:18]** Doesn't hurt too much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:24]** You know, mass like, you know, explosion.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** It's great.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** I'm going to stand by that one.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:29]** I mean, apples explode pretty well.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:32]** Peanut butter would be also just, like, dastardly.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** Yeah.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:36]** But it's also hard to throw, and then it gets on you.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** It's like, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** I think, like, ball-shaped fruits are really good.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** Like, oranges and apples.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:43]** Are you trying to hurt somebody in this food fight?

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** I'm trying to win.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:45]** I'm trying to win.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** Is that winning?

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:46]** I'm trying to win.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** Hurting somebody is winning?

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:51]** That's a food fight, not a food fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** That's not a food fight.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** Deactivate a mess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** Murder bot mode now, Kev.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** Turn murder bot mode off.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** What are the terms of engagement?

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** Kevin's like, I'll just throw a watermelon at them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** Yeah.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:02]** The best food?

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** Durian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** Durian.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** Exactly.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** From a fucking slingshot.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Yeah.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** He's got fucking whole jackfruits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:15]** I made a mini trebuchet, and I just posted it in the corner.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** I'm just throwing spiked fruits in there.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** What kind of food fights you been in?

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** He's like, I only use trebuchets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:24]** He uses a water balloon launcher to throw jackfruit and durian.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:27]** Does anyone have a better answer than banana cream pie?

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:28]** Chili.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** That's a great answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** Hot chili.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** Pepper spray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** Stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:58]** like chili like beans and and like cooked it's like spicy and temperature hot though it's double it's it's it's got the liquid messiness so that you get the shotgun spray it's got the small particles that you can actually launch at a good distance like i have a see there's one flaw in your plan okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:01]** What's the container that you're launching it with?

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:02]** It depends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** Like a styrofoam bowl?

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:08]** I would either have like a satchel full of chili.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:11]** Like think a wine skin, but with chili.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:14]** Or I would have some sort of like... I don't want to.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:19]** Some sort of girded pot that I can just like... A girded pot.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** I can yank the lid and... Girded pot.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:27]** And then in extreme scenarios, I could pick it up and just dump it on my... On whomever remains.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:57]** i feel like this is what we need again ambrosia salad is that what it's called i i never liked it i never liked it my somebody in my family always makes it but it's a marshmallow based salad this might be the only legitimate use for ambrosia salad yeah yeah like you just like chuck it it's like soft it's like a trifle but oh okay it's like a trifle got it got it got it a trifle i don't know any of these words like a southern thing yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** I'm sorry if I'm offending anybody by saying that.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:11]** No, you don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** You offended me when you said, let's throw hot chili.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** Lots of different colors.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** When I didn't think you could get more out of pocket.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:35]** I need to use out of pocket or in the pocket more often in my life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:35]** Yeah.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:40]** I only use it... We're going to start throwing pickled horse testicles now.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:45]** As long as it's eaten somewhere, it would qualify as a food.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:49]** Jell-O shots, maybe?

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:56]** Aren't buffalo testicles considered... Like Colorado oysters, is that what they are?

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:39]** I bet they throw kiwis during a food fight.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:39]** No.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** Kiwis are so good, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** Kevin, but that would be a waste of kiwis.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** They're like little and fuzzy.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:42]** Okay.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:44]** Boiled eggs.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:44]** No.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** I'm going to veto that right now.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** Soft boiled eggs.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:50]** Soft boiled eggs maybe.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:57]** We have one other thing, which is that if you've been listening and you're here.

**[00:11:57 - 00:12:03]** Maybe you might realize that, you know, recording for Plot Armor is on the horizon.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** It's out there.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:17]** And we have mentioned in our Discord that we have a sheet available for you to send in your questions of what you think may be answered or discussed.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:26]** Uh, I forget what Kelly's sample questions were that he wrote down, but there, you could ask pretty much anything about what the characters are thinking in book three, what you think might happen next.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:30]** Uh, some weird mistake that I made or some question about some detail.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:30]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:34]** Yeah.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** We're all going to log off.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** It's just going to be John at the end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:57]** It's just going to be me.

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:59]** There's going to be no music.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:02]** It's John's personal break room.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** Just kidding.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:41]** We're going to get a bunch of Bart Simpson names now that you say that.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** Probably.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:46]** I forget all the Bart Simpson ones that are really good about.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:51]** Well, let's play.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:54]** But we're going to start somewhere else because this is episode 150.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** So things got to change now at this point.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Things are starting to pivot.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** The ship's been moving.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:02]** And what's the new direction that we're headed?

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:06]** Let's find out.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** I want you guys to

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:08]** You know.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** Close your eyes.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** Oh, I thought you were going to say the map.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:13]** No.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** We'll get to the map soon enough.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** Just take a second and breathe in.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:24]** Let yourself relax.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:34]** Because we open, fading in from black, on a shot of a clean blue sky.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:47]** The sounds of birds chirping as the camera pans down and you see before you a friendly green park in the middle of the city.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:52]** High rises in the background, but here, right here, it's serene.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:58]** All manners of individuals are strolling past.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** There's a contemplative Shireen.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:04]** There's some chatty elves walking by.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:10]** Two elder vests over on another little hill performing their morning exercises.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:11]** Food fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** Have a food fight.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:15]** One has a pineapple.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:21]** A Barathu walks by, quickly talking on their very busy phone.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:27]** Many others just strolling, enjoying an idyllic day in the park.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:36]** The camera begins to move backwards, and the shot widens to include the back of an android's head.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:45]** Short brown hair sitting cropped neatly above a dark gray dirty jumpsuit.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:56]** Their head is motionless as sunlight seems to dapple across their shoulders through just the relaxed castravelian trees moving in the wind above them.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:11]** Time moves slowly as the regular and varied figures of life continue to just walk past, and then their android head only staying straight until it glances casually to the left.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:21]** Their head slowly follows, turning to the right, as into the frame we see this cute family walking by.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:33]** There are three Sheeran parents and this small Sheeran child, and suddenly the child starts to run forward, and two of the parents are laughing, and the other one is reaching out like, No, no, no!

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:33]** Say it!

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:35]** trying to make sure the child doesn't fall.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:45]** They keep walking across the frame and the android's head just slowly follows them watching until they've gone long past.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:57]** Then we see the android's shoulders move up and sigh as there's this computer chime.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:11]** And then the park slowly begins to fade away, all of its serenity, as we realize that that was just a hologram.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:20]** And we're sitting in a small stone chamber, no more than a cell with a dark purple stone, just four feet away, replacing the view of the park.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** There's no sounds.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:23]** There's nothing.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:34]** And then the camera moves and kind of locks into this head-stabilized view behind the back of the android's head at the center of the screen.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:40]** You know how in like a video game it moves and then, you know, as they stand up, the camera moves with their head movements.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:47]** We see soft floor lights illuminate across the bare dark purple walls.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:52]** There are small cutouts for, you know, sundry items, toiletries.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:54]** There's nothing in them.

**[00:17:55 - 00:18:07]** They walk over to a door which opens into a frigid, tight hallway, the same width as the cell, with a floor lined with grated metal.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** And they start walking.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:16]** The soft maze of winding tunnels begins to introduce itself to us.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:23]** Every few feet is another light patiently waiting at the base of the wall, slowly lighting the androids way.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:33]** We first pass intersections with other winding hallways as they start to take a dizzying array of left, right, left, left, left, right.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:37]** We pass secluded alcoves that end at silent doors.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:43]** One has strobes of red and purple light that dance around the perimeter.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:47]** While behind another you hear the faint sounds of desperate voices.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:53]** Maybe a shout and then the angry banging of clubs as those voices are silenced.

**[00:18:56 - 00:19:00]** One door starting to close as they pass.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:17]** They don't look, but we see a skinless arm dangling from a table, tubes intravenously snaking deep into open muscle tissue and depositing down into a slot in the floor before the door finally closes.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:30]** Eventually, the maze of hallways narrows into one long, straight hallway, and the footsteps begin to slow as they approach a different door than the rest.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:36]** A red, solid door with a single red light above it.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:44]** The dark purple walls on either side framing this sudden, unexpected red.

**[00:19:45 - 00:20:06]** lasers shoot out and scan the android's head to toe and then disappear 30 seconds one minute two minutes three minutes five minutes past the android's head remaining remaining motionless on moving

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:19]** And then the light above the door turns green and the scene cuts to black as we hear the hiss of the door open.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:28]** And let's come back to our present world now.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Let's play.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:33]** Kev has his hands underneath his eyes.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** I don't know what that means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:39]** I have no idea what that cutscene was for.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** Like who?

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:44]** I want to assume it was Rick, but it doesn't sound like Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:46]** Well, I feel like Rick, I mean, it would make sense.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:53]** Like Rick basically has us all like tied up in two somewhere, you know, it could, it checks out.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** I don't know.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** It's possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:00]** The door opens to reveal a stockpile of durian and jackfruit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:01]** I knew it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:06]** Ready to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:11]** I don't want to lose what a great response pineapple was to that question.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** And you just like slipped it in there.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:14]** That was spectacular.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** True that.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:21]** Yeah, I think that might have been the Watcher.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Or the Observer.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:24]** I forgot what we called him.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** The Listener?

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** The Listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** As an android, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:29]** As an android.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:32]** Maybe he was an android and then a reptoid.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:34]** Or the reptoid and then an android.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** Or maybe he was a reptoid playing as an android.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:37]** We don't know.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:40]** We'll have to ask him after we kick Orvier Pike's a**.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** Too bad there's no other way.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** That's it.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** That was the only cutscene for that.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** There's nothing else ever.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:47]** We'll never come back to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:51]** Like an end scene in a Marvel movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:52]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:56]** Oh, we still haven't seen that character come into any shows.

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:00]** What?

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:00]** Let's...

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** I brought you guys back to the map.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:11]** It is paused here in Foundry because just real quick as we're getting in here, I think we're at a good place and a good pace.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:17]** And real quick as we're getting back into this fight, I want to talk about your why here.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:25]** Because this is slight open for discussion, but I'll share with you kind of what I'm seeing.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:37]** I see this encounter right now as fighting for your future to get out of these designs of the Reptoids.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:50]** And from what you've seen with Effecta and perhaps Colin's sister and other people, you're not the only individuals who have some role to play, right?

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:53]** You're not the only people in their plans, but you're definitely important.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:59]** And these Reptoids here are not the only ones working behind the scenes.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:06]** But the ones here are the ones that we can definitely say, like, f*** you to these Reptoids.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:12]** Also, f*** the Greys for trying to tell you all what you need to do, what you need to be.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:22]** And since you've escaped your callous, it feels like you've tasted freedom over the past few days on your own.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** You've made friends.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:25]** You've made enemies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** Who's our enemy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** Oh, I guess.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** I mean, all the Reptoids?

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** Yeah, Nyx and Cairo.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** College's gestures in the circle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:36]** Yeah, just like in every direction.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:39]** We knew about these people, though, before we were free.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:43]** But I guess we killed those two dudes at that weird outpost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** Nyx and Cairo.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** Well, you killed Nyx.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** Kelly did that one.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** It was all yours.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** They killed them?

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** Yeah, yours killed Nyx.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:53 - 00:24:20]** that's true yeah well i wouldn't have had to if we well i guess i would have had to eventually anyway that's the thing these are the choices that like this is the impression that you're starting out in the world on your own right and some of these things are unavoidable and some are not but that's my point is that you are starting to make them not in the confines of outpost omicron not in the confines of turkala space and maybe consciously or subconsciously

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:23]** there has been a burden hanging over your head.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** There's been a horizon.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:32]** There's been a time limit on this because you knew that at some point you have to come full circle with these captors.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** And right now it's these Reptoids from Tyrcalis Bates.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:37]** And now is this challenge.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** It is your like fight for autonomy.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:43]** It is your chance to claim this freedom from these Reptoids.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:49]** Maybe to stick it to them for what they might've done to some people that you knew and loved.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** You don't own us.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** We own us.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** Yeah.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:55]** Hopefully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:55 - 00:25:15]** hopefully yeah we own us yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway any other any thoughts about that any any other feelings about it i see kev holding some hot chili thinking about throwing it i'm just i'm still caught up on the


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:24]** I think the Reptoids are the second full, like everything that's happened in book three has been dealing with these Reptoids as stewards.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:30]** And now we find out that there are Reptoids and it's all going to come to a head in Roselight.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:32]** Everything is pointing to Roselight at this point.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:34]** If we survive this fight, we're going to move to Roselight.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:35]** If you survive.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:42]** But it's like, I don't know what the Reptoids and the Greys have to do with each other.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:44]** There's definitely something there.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:51]** And then there's also something that has to do with us and why the four of us are chosen for this.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:57]** And then I forget who were the two that Orvier said to keep alive.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:59]** It was Rick, because Rick was almost dead.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:03]** He was literally like one attack away from dying permanently.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:09]** And he said to leave Rick and Colin alive, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:14]** I believe they were willing to split you up.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** And I think it was Hears and Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:20]** Yeah, they wanted us to stay or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:22]** Yeah, there was like, here's a doctor.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** Okay, we'll stay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:25]** Rick and Colin will go.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:27]** Yeah.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:30]** What if we had said yes to that?

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** I know.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** What if you said yes?

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** So horrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:34]** That's kind of my thought right now.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** I was like, why don't we say yes?

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:37]** We'll find out in our second playthrough.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:40]** Yeah.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:42]** Wouldn't that be crazy if it just starts over?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** Choose your own adventure.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:50]** And you're in the lobby about to walk onto the Chimera Wild here.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:53]** You take a stop at the second cargo man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** The first place you go.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** It's actually the Chimera.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** It's the Void Chimera.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** The Chimera?

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:01]** Yeah, it's the Void Chimera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:07]** Well, look, we ended last episode after... Just want to quick recap back and forth in this combat.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:19]** It is a tough fight against the slimy Wetsalt, the calm collected Vlaka Officer Astara, the demanding Orvier Pike, and the spellcaster slash doctor.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:19]** Dr.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:24]** O.K., you have returned after Dr. Nodens kindly asked you to leave.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:30]** Then Rick19 got a shot off on Orvier.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:33]** Finally, here lands that geyser spell.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:35]** And Colin, you got angry.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** You got a little out of control.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** You got a little incensed.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:45]** And you stepped forward into that time loop trap.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** Failed your will save.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:49]** Failed your will save.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** We'll save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** We'll save!

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:54]** Time loop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:54]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** Time loop, we'll save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:04]** And the condition of that being, of course, that you are under the effect of the confusion spell.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:14]** So I'm going to need you to roll a D100 as I pull up the table.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:19]** Oh, this is going to be great.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:22]** Let me go ahead and bring this battle music back in.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:28]** What... You better roll... For you, I want you to roll high.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:31]** You probably want you to roll low for this.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** The D1 hundo.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** The D1 hundo.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** What does it say when you look in the two leaders?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** Courtesy of Dispel Dice.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** It says... Hey!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** Dispel Dice.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** 52.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:43]** Also, this music... 5-2.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:45]** Huh?

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:45]** 52.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** A middling roll.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:50]** A middling roll, as they say.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** I'm going to unpause here.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** It's an Ohio roll.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** It's an Ohio roll.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:57]** It's an Ohio roll for sure.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:01]** Unfortunately for you, Colin.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** Safety squints.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:05]** The 1 to 25 act normally.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:10]** 26 to 50 do nothing but babble incoherently.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:15]** 76 to 100 attack


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:44]** nearest creature but 51 to 75 that is tough because that is deal 1d8 plus your strength modifier damage to self with item in hand Jesus Christ on a motorbike that is of all possible outcomes how is it 1d8 okay whatever


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:44 - 00:30:07]** 1d8 plus strength what are you holding in your hand to set this he's holding a survival knife in one hand and a needler pistol in the other which one do you use does he have to shoot himself as well in the face i imagine he uses both oh no because what is one d4 please the third each one d4 so like

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:11]** Well, it's your strength modifier, so it's a D8 plus your strength modifier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:12]** Yeah, no, it's not.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** It's just for flavor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** So that's five.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:23]** Thankfully, for the first time in this entire adventure, my negative one strength modifier is a benefit.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:28]** So I only take four damage.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:30]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** Because Colin hit the books instead of hitting the gym.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** Okay, but he does hit the gym too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:37]** He's a well-rounded man.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:39]** Do you shoot yourself in the foot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:53]** I think he's absentmindedly flipping his survival knife and then a bout of confusion hits him and he just misses and it just goes straight down into his boot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** Just into the foot.

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:00]** This makes sense actually because you're also entangled for four rounds.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:03]** You're only confused for one round.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Why is he entangled?

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** You're entangled for four rounds.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:07]** That's part of the spell.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** Because of the... Oh, it's part of the spell.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:14]** It's a special... You're confused for one round, entangled for... Okay, all right.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:17]** So this is my only round of confused.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:17]** Right.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:21]** This is your only round of rolling on a table to see what you need to do.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:21]** Gotcha.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** Because you confused yourself by shooting yourself in the foot.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:27]** And you're like, why did I just... Stab you.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:27]** Oh, God.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** Yeah.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:29]** Cool.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:33]** My anti-survival knife really did wonders for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:36]** Yeah.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:36]** Wow.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:37]** Okay.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:39]** I mean, that's what happened.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:43]** And to be clear, I think you're seeing, like we said last time, you're seeing Kaniko there.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:47]** Just for that split second, you saw that.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** I'll leave it up to you.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:53]** It feels like once you hurt yourself, maybe that breaks that confuse.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:56]** You're confused until your next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:02]** I feel like he was absentmindedly tossing the survival knife, and then he saw Kaniko and froze for a moment.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:12]** And that moment was the... And then as soon as the pain hit his brain, Kaniko poofed off into the ether.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** Yeah.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:16]** Oh man, I can see you walking forward and you're ready.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:19]** You're like tossing it as like an unconscious motion.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:23]** You're like, I am ready to take this down.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:26]** You step in and your eyes glaze over.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** You miss it.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:27]** It drops.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:27]** Yeah.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:28]** Rough.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** That's the move.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** Wow.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** That's the move.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** I'm going to mark you as untangled.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** Untangled.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** That's the sequel.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:39]** That's the sequel to Tangled.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** If they didn't do that, they should.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:42]** Wow.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:48]** Was there anything else that you... I think that's... My guess is that takes up your whole turn.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:49]** Right.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:51]** Because you become mentally befuddled and can't act normally.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:55]** So I feel like that's your turn, unfortunately, was you stepping forward and becoming confused.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** Okay.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:57]** Sure.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:59]** That's how I'm reading it.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** That tracks.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** Yeah.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** Alright!

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** We're back in round two.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Things are heating up.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:10]** Colin's in the middle of essentially Astara, the Wet's Alp, and Dr. Nodens.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:13]** Rick and Effect are back close to the door.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:15]** Dr. OK and Hears are back behind the door.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:20]** We're going to move to Dr. Nodens' turn.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** What does Dr. Nodens do?

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** It's a good question.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:26]** It's a good question.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** You know what she's going to do?

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:28]** Let's see what that is.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:32]** Let's see what this is right here.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:35]** What I'm thinking is that she scans the battlefield.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:39]** Seeing that Colin is just down for just a second.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:43]** Just a brief moment to just stay down.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** I'm going to look here on the map.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:50]** I'm going to use the handy-dandy foundry tools here to just see.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:52]** Yeah, that's what I thought.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:55]** She's about 30 feet away from you, Rick19.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** Her eyes land on you.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** She very loudly says...

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:04]** Rick, why don't you join us?

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:09]** And, Rick, I need you to roll.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** Oh, well, save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** Oh, well, save.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Natural one.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Oh, oh, oh.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:24]** I got an eight on the die for a total of 13.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** A 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:27]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:29]** Yeah, that's not good.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** That's not good at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:34]** Something about her words, you're like, you know what?

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:38]** I do want to come right near you right now.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:43]** And you need to move as quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:45]** Is she using a spell for this?

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** Because this is like the fourth time that she's done it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:52]** Yeah, we can submit your question in plot armor.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:54]** We can talk about it in plot armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** It's going to be too late by then.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** We'll all be dead.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** You'll all be dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:00]** So on my turn, I have to move as quickly as I can.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:03]** Towards me for one round, taking no other actions.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:05]** Yep.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:08]** Yep.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** That is her turn.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** And she just...

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:19]** She smiles and laughs as she sees your eyes succumb and knows that she has your mind.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** Officer Astara.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** It is her turn.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** And she.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:35]** She takes a five foot step forward.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** And then it is Rick 19th turn.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** What do you do?

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:42]** Actually, she's not going to take a five foot step forward.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:43]** She's going to stay right where she is.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:46]** Rick19, what do you do on your turn?

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** It is your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:52]** I have to move as quick as I can towards Nodens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Toward Nodens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** Yes.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** I can't see what that says.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** Is that 30 feet?

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** That's...

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:07]** So I just walk right up, kind of just brush past Colin, bump his shoulder, keep walking, and stop right in front of her.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** Question them.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:12]** While I'm doing that, can I put away my gun and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:17]** Or you can take any other actions.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:19]** Yeah, like I just have to walk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:20]** I think so.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** You taking no other actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** Because you didn't tell me what is happening to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:30]** You are under the influence of a command spell.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** It's a command spell, okay.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:34]** So that is my whole turn is just moving up to her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:37]** Right, and that was it.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** It was for one round.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:44]** And yeah, it says you can't take other actions.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:46]** Okay.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:53]** Officer Astara is no... This is not her first rodeo.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:55]** This is not her first rodeo.

**[00:36:56 - 00:37:03]** She is going to move in initiative order to immediately after Rick 19.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:08]** Her hand reaches out

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:10]** Maybe he or she sees this.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** Maybe Colin.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:12]** Maybe not.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:12]** I don't know.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** Her hand reaches out.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** Pushes a button on the wall to shut the door.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** And immediately...

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:31]** The space that you see bordered, that Colin, Rick, and Dr. Nodens are in, you see it's like a long strip that goes underneath starships.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:36]** That begins to lower down.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** Okay.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** And as it does, all these...

**[00:37:39 - 00:38:07]** like in a line all the lights come on because this is where they have like random tools and things to fix starships and there's not that much there but all the lights do come on to as basically everything that is bordered by these lights that you see here on the screen is now five ten feet below okay it's ten feet down from you're in a cage match everywhere around it yeah yeah

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** That was Officer Astar's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** Here's Fabricius.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:15]** I feel a tactical blunder on their part.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:19]** Yeah, so here's Kelly.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:19]** Where is she?

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:21]** Was like wondering.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** Where's who?

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** You can't see her because you're in the hallway.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:28]** Yeah, I think she's in the hallway.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:35]** Kelly was thinking, like, very often in MMOs, it's, like, advantageous to remove the ads, so-called, first.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:42]** You know, like, the supporting ones, because you can just, generally speaking, for the action economy, for whatever reason, that's good.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:51]** I was asking ChatGPT if that's the case here, and it's like, it kind of depends, because there's, like, one, you have one person who has special abilities, like, mind control and sh**.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:57]** But I think I am going to go with the traditional tactic and try to take out Officer Astara first, the weaker character.

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:00]** Your favorite species.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:02]** I know, it's painful.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** It's really painful.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:09]** Also, I'm in this room, so I think I have to walk out now, unfortunately.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:12]** Yes, you do need to walk into the room.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:14]** Question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:14]** Okay.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:20]** Before you move, can we mark the... Because we know the range of the wet cells field.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:21]** Yes.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** Disruptor field.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** What is that range?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:27]** It is a 30-foot.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:27]** One sec.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** It's not 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** I thought it was like 20 or 15.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** I didn't even notice the what's up.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:31]** No, it's not 20.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** It could be a 30-diameter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** Silly Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:36]** Click everyone, Google what's up.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:38]** It is 30 feet.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:43]** And for Aura, I think Aura is diameter.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:45]** Aura Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:49]** So 15-foot radius is what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** Let's see.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:55]** Is that what it says?

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:57]** Can't they just use math terms?

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Why can't they just write in R or D?

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:02]** It doesn't say.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:04]** It says listed range.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:06]** I'm going to guess it's diameter.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:08]** It's probably diameter.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** Going to go with diameter.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:13]** So, yeah, let me get a circle going here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** I think by all measurements, though, it's radius in this book.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:18]** They have to specifically call it out as diameter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:18]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:31]** You seeing a thing that says, like, all ranges are... Well, if you look at the tactical... There's a page that shows how to, like, plot cones and auras.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:31]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** Is it a 30-foot aura?


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:34]** Shh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:38]** I don't see 30 foot, but it shows 10 foot radius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** No, for the wet salt, it's 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:45]** Yeah, for the electromagnetic field, it gives 30 foot, and then it says the DC to overcome it.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:45]** Yeah.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** Which I believe Bernice overcame it.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** I think it's a radius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** I think Kevin's right.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:54]** Yeah, from what I'm seeing, I also agree that it's radius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:54 - 00:41:14]** rules lawyer rules lawyer more than meets the eye uh so am i doing this right why is this not let me do it you all can see this white circle yes that for some reason the really cool part of foundry that lets you actually do this stuff is not working and you all can see it also looks like your your aura field is too small

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** All right.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** Well, well, uh, thank you, Will.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:19]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** I will adjust it while, Kelly, you tell me what you're going to do with your turn.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:23]** But now you can't, the Wexel can't move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** It has to stay right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** I forgot about that.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:28]** Weird, weird.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** Yeah.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** When you have an aura, you can't move.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:31]** Right.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** You're actually... It's like an artillery setup.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:33]** Uh, Kelly.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:34]** Right.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:38]** Yeah, it's like a, it's like a food fight trebuchet.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:40]** Kelly, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:43]** Remind me of the function of the aura, please.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** I was looking something up while you were describing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** It messes with electronics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:53]** Yeah, you basically need to roll a reflex save or your electronic weapon is drained of its charge and you lose your action.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:54]** Wonderful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** That won't be a problem for Hears.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:59]** Hears is going to focus on the wet selt.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:01]** He forgot that it existed.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** Such a scrub.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:08]** So he's going to attack him with his usual magic missile awesomeness for 15 total damage.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** Full attack.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:12]** Okay.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** Wow.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:14]** Impressive.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:17]** Impressive, sir.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:17]** Thanks.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:19]** Yeah, I mean, he might just stay here.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:23]** I mean, like, his thing is basically going to cover, like, almost half of the usable space here.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:29]** All right, so that's 15 damage as you just still haven't stepped foot in, right?

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:29]** Nope.


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:31]** Wow.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:31]** Okay.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** Fire magic missile.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:34]** Take out 15 damage.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** Call it a day.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Wipe your hands.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** Say, I'm going to see you guys later.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** I did my part.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:40]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** No, we'll not do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:42]** Thank you very much.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:45]** He's not that kind of guy.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:47]** He's not that kind of guy.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:47]** All right.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:49]** It is Effecta's turn.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:51]** Effecta is going.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:55]** I think she needs to roll her save, actually.

**[00:42:56 - 00:43:01]** She needs to roll that because she tried to shoot last time, but I don't think she was in range.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:28]** she fails her her reflex save and she loses her action um but what she is going to do is start to move to attack the wet salt i think she's just going to move in because she's like all right well i don't want that to happen again she's going to take a 10 feet forward just run along the wall trying to stay close to you all but trying to be helpful against this wet salt


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** She runs along the wall, like her feet go up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:33]** Yeah, like a mirror's edge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** She's like, God!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:34]** Yeah.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:41]** The Wetzel, seeing her come up, is going to attack her because that's... Does he have tip of range?

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** She's right next to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** Is it his turn?

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:47]** I'm confused on why he gets so tight.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** Because it's his turn.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** Okay, okay.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** Just checking.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** Wetzel's turn, he hits.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:58]** That is a 21, which definitely beats Efekta's

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:20]** ac unfortunately and effecta is going to take yikes oh she's down takes 14 points of damage and oh i forgot about this thank you past me for doing this i totally forgot about that uh oh okay

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:36]** You see maybe here's you see that the claw that rips into effect has some sort of like greenish weird iridescent liquid on it.

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:47]** And as it cuts her, there's just any like this immediate strange germ like virus effect that seems to just go across her skin at that moment.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Oh, God.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** And she fails.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** And she is sickened.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** Gross.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:53]** Oh, great.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** So she's going to start throwing up.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:57]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:59]** Affecta is affected by something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:03]** Affecta is affected by something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** It's super Affecta.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:08]** Some kind of sickness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Thank you for that.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:09]** Thank you for that.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:13]** Dr. K, you might need to jump in.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** You might need to jump in.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:16]** Who knows?

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** Who knows?

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** She's only second for one round.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** So she's good for one round.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:25]** End of round two.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** Lots of things are happening.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:28]** Think about what you want to have happen next.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** Orvier, Pyke.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** Maybe Rick.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:35]** Colin, you're still in your confused state, but I'll say you can too.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:39]** Rick, here's... Actually, just everybody give me a perception check.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:42]** Orvier, Pyke is currently close to the Void Crier.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:45]** He's crouching behind this box.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:48]** He's not crouching, but he's standing behind this box ready to go.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** What does everyone get?

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** Word.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** 14.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** 19.

**[00:45:52 - 00:46:18]** 14 19 20 30 30 nailed it from downtown freaking nailed it um okay you have like a like a narrow corridor to really focus on him interestingly enough find your own line if you wanted to just make something happen cool you see him pull out

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:24]** a vial that I think you all recognize as a serum of healing.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:28]** Okay.

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:30]** And he takes a serum of healing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:32]** I hate it when they have those.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** So much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** It's a full round, right?

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** It's a full round action to take your own serum of healing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:40]** Is it a full round?

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** Now I forget.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** I think it's a movement action.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:45]** A movement to take it out and a standard action to use it.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** It's a full round to give to somebody else.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:49]** So his whole turn is taking this seriously.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** His whole turn is taking this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** He is the furthest away from you.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:52]** He's what?

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:55]** 60 feet-ish.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** Yeah, he's like 60 feet away from Dr. K. Maybe 30 from Rick, so you definitely see it.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** But, yeah.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** 55, actually.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:30]** isn't he also burning should he take burn damage at the top of his turn he takes burn damage at the top of his turn thank you yes oh good question can he it's a and he gets a reflex saving throw at the end of every round to to undo it right i don't remember yes i think so so here's do you want to roll the d6 of burn damage and let me know how much burn damage he takes you roll it once and it's it's always it's a consistent number throughout right it's always you don't have to reroll on every round i don't think

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** I don't remember what he took last time.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** That's the problem.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:36]** There's no way of knowing.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** And there's no way to know.

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** 1d6 is what you said?

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:39]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:48]** If it's a 1 or 2, we'll say that you can redo it next time because I don't want you to take a lower damage potential just because I didn't look at what it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:53]** Well, it's a 3, so it's okay.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:54]** That's fine.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** That's okay.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** Dr. Dodon's also burning.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** Middling...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:02]** No, I think we decided that she had not been affected by that.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** No effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** No effect.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:08]** And he gets another saving throw.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:12]** So a reflex saving throw at the end of the round to remove the condition.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:16]** 10 plus the amount of fire damage that I took this round.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** So it's DC 13.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:20]** That's what I'm reading.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** Does he put it out?

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** He got a 16.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:41]** So he literally takes the damage and just being the that he is, just pulls it, swigs it, and then just literally like just takes whatever left, just kind of dumps it on there, brushes off the fire.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:42]** Just doesn't even flinch.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:43]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:43]** I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** Yeah.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** You know, just one of those.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** Casual.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** Dr.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** O.K., what are you doing?

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** Lots has changed.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** A lot has changed.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:56]** Two of your colleagues are 10 feet below the level that you are at now.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:57]** One of them sickened.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** Lots happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:27]** yeah um dr k is first he's gonna instruct bernice to take a position deeper in the hallway out of the range of this wet cell oh okay well bernice already passed and that was like oh yeah so once you pass once you're you're good okay you are good um you are good my friend

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:33]** I still feel like she's going to try to take a tactical position, take a tactical position.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:39]** Cause I found out that her cylindrical lens pistol has a range of 80 feet.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:44]** Oh, so she's going to just do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:47]** Just a reminder though, like range is just an increment, right?

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** So that, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** I don't take a penalty past 30.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** So yeah, that's it.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:55]** Which is my other weapon.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:00]** Well, get as much damage as you can because you need every help that you can get.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:00]** Yeah.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:07]** So I think actually what's going to happen is Bernice is going to move into position to have a clear shot at Orvier.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:08]** Okay.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** Meanwhile, Dr. O.K.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:15]** is going to move up to Effecta.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** She's only sticking for one round.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:18]** That's fine.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Okay.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:19]** Yeah.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** Okay, so you move up behind her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:24]** Yeah, but I can't do anything else, right?

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:28]** Because I'm going to move and fire with Bernice and see how this goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** And then you'll move.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:30]** Okay.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** And sorry, Bernice is firing at who?

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** The what's up?

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:33]** No.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** Orvear.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** Orvear.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** Okay.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** All right.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** Thank you.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:37]** Yeah.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** Put him in his place.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:42]** And it's a 16 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** 16 to hit against.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** That does not hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** That does not hit.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:49]** Okay.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** Well, damn it.

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:52]** Well, that sucked.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:58]** So, yeah, Bernice just fires off a shot, I guess, and it flies past.

**[00:50:59 - 00:50:59]** Ricochets past.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** Hits the Voidcrier.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:05]** Voidcrier breaks one of the legs that falls over on Orvier.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:05]** Dies instantly.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:06]** Incredible.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Incredible work, Bernice.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:10]** Okay.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** That's the end of the turn.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** That's the end of the turn.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** Colin Edenbrand, what are you doing?

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:18]** You are entangled for, this is your first of four rounds that you're entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:20]** Yeah, I'm going to roll the acrobatics check to get out.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:23]** How dare you read the rules and know that you can do that?

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:28]** It's going to be a pretty solid eight.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Wait, you can do that?

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:30]** It doesn't say that you can.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:34]** It says if you have the entangled condition, you can roll an acrobatic check to get out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** I am not seeing that on Aeon SRD.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** All right.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** The question is, I don't know what the DC of that would be.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:44]** Oh, well, where did I read this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Where did you read that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:50]** That's the question that we always try to answer.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** Maybe I was mistaken.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:58]** I don't know why I've, I've, I've remembered doing that and I just read it, but now that I'm looking at it and tangled again, I can actually do that.

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:58]** Cool.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:05]** So I'm going to move at half speed because I can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** You're 10 feet down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:07]** I am.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** I'm going to move at half speed.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** What's my overall speed?

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** Let's see.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:18]** 30 feet.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** Overall speed.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** Cool.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** That means I can move 15 feet total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:27]** So you can use an acrobatics, but it's usually to escape a physical restraint.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:27]** Right.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:30]** Like net, vines, winds, etc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** And I think this is mental.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:34]** That acrobatics would be invalid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:34]** I don't know.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** The knife's pretty physical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:58]** thanks appreciate that he's like sorry stapled to the floor with this knife cool so i'm gonna move 10 feet down 10 feet down and then i'm going to um mind thrust this out of dr nodens

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:01]** He is... Go foes it.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:06]** What's her... I'm going to cast it at the fourth level.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** A will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:12]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** DC 60 and roll it.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:14]** A lot of will saves.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:17]** DC 60 and rolling my... Yeah, a lot of will saves.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Rolling these dice that my wife got me.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:21]** That's fitting for 150.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:28]** These beautiful will saves brought to you by the dice that we have and Siren's Cape.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** You know what that is?

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:31]** It's a nice natural 20 there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:33]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:36]** Yo, it fits for Dr. Nodens, though.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** She don't play.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** She don't play.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:42]** The look on Kev's face just gave me was like, you.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:48]** So she takes 20 half 10 mind shot damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** 10 mind-thrusting damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:53]** He's just, like, thrusting right at her mind.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** And he's going to take a five-foot step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** Are you just pretending she's still Kadiko?

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** Back up.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:03]** Oh, God.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** Just close your eyes and pretend.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** You just put it back.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:09]** Never mind, I'm not going to go in.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** Like the... That's funny.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:14]** Mind thrust.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** Mind thrust.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** Mind thrust.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:18]** That's the turn.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** Let's get it.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** That's the turn.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** Okay, cool.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Sounds good.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** You know whose turn it is.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** Dr. Nodens.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:27]** No, I'm sorry, buddy.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** I'm sorry.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:29]** Sorry about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** What is... I should just Google this.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** What is versus SR?

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** Spell versus spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:39]** Yes, sir.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** What are going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** What are going on?

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** Okay, I know what she's going to do.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:49]** She's going to take a five-foot step back, a guarded stepperone.

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:52]** I believe that's the pronunciation.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** Guarded stoop-de-doop.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** And...

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** Yeah, a little steppy scooby-doo.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:08]** And she is going to look at Rick and she says, how did I have you?

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:11]** Just you and me and your friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:14]** How is it just you and me then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:16]** Just you and me and your friend.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** Now that I'm outnumbered.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** Now that I'm outnumbered.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:19]** F*** you up.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:20]** Please double check me.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** I didn't think about that.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:24]** I didn't think about the end of the sentence when I started the sentence.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** All right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:29]** Nobody makes me bleed by all this thrusting has made me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:31]** I was thrusting so hard.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** It felt like somebody was thinking that I was somebody else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:37]** Man, what if they both started by thrusting me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:41]** Let's make sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:44]** That's a very different podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:50]** Unfortunately, what I'm about to say fits in, which is let's make sure that you're a little more willing, Rick19.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:52]** And you need to make a will save, Rick19.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** Another will save.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:55]** Another will save.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** As many will saves as possible in episode 150.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:02]** As a reaction, he's going to use spell guard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:04]** Oh, what is Spellguard?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:13]** When an adjacent ally is targeted by a spell or spell-like ability, grant plus two to his save, but take minus two to my own saves until next turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Wow.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:15]** So that's a plus two there, buddy.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:22]** $15 die, plus five for my little save, so 22 thanks to Spellguard.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:23]** 22!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:24]** Okay.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:28]** You feel like your brain and your body...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:32]** It's like a storm.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:32]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:37]** Also, just to check, is this a mind effect?

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:40]** This is a... Yes, it is mind affecting.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** That's an extra plus two, so 24.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** Super plus two.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:45]** Damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:50]** You feel this wave of pain wrack your body.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** Right.

**[00:56:52 - 00:57:01]** This agonizing pain racks your body, and because you succeeded and you just killed it, it will only affect you for one round.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:05]** You have a minus two to ability checks, attack rolls, and skill checks.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:09]** Great spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:09]** Okay.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:13]** Minus two to attack rolls and ability checks.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:14]** Okay.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** I'll try to remember that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** Good thing it's my turn.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** For one round.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** For one round.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:19]** Yep.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** That was her turn.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** She took a step back.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:26]** And yeah, I mean, it makes sense that you're like, I have been affected already.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:36]** So it's like seeing her magical signature coming towards you and knowing that you're like, I feel, I know how this effect comes over me.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:40]** So it makes sense that the dice tell the story that you are like, I can resist it.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** Rick19, it's your turn.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:46]** You have a minus two to ability checks and attack rolls and skill checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** What do you do?

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:50]** Well, first thing he does is using a swift action.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:53]** He's got this artillery laser on his shoulder pointed.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** That's what he uses.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:58]** But it just vanishes.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:00]** And not as like a dispersion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:01]** Say again?

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:03]** Is it like War Machine, like with the cannon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** Ooh, that's cool.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:08]** Yeah, I think it's more like Iron Man in Capcom.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:08]** Oh.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:09]** Yeah.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:14]** But that big cannon just vanishes down into a tattoo on his arm.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:15]** Oh.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:19]** As he reaches back and pulls out his...

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:25]** Using a move action, he pulls out his apprehension capture pole.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:31]** And as he does that, all his nanites kind of just burst out from him.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:38]** And they are going to actually fill up the squares, which I was trying to see if there's a way to draw on here.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** I don't know how to draw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:41]** Yeah, there should be a pencil.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** I don't see the pencil.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:43]** Do you have that?

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:44]** That's fine.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** I don't.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** So you're casting a dispersion?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** Cloud array.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:53]** And so here, here, and here.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:59]** So the cloud's going to kind of encompass Rick and Colin, who's right next to him.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:05]** And then it's going to also fill the square between Nodens and Rick.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:11]** Um, and that's going to give us, I used, uh, uh, Nanite storage for that.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:20]** So that's going to give me, um, give me and Colin, I think a 10% concealment, which is specific to cloud array.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** Um, okay.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** Uh, no, that square should be over.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** Yeah, there you go.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:25]** Okay.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:27]** So that is all one.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:29]** That's a swift action, a move action.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:35]** And then he's going to take a strike as a standard action against Nodens because he has reach with this weapon.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** He has reach.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** He does.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** He does.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** He does.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** For the win.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:41]** Yeah, this pull was pretty legit.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:43]** Pretty legit pull.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:48]** It's a 14 on the die with a plus eight for 24 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:51]** 24 to hit is a hit with that pretty legit pull.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** Pretty legit pull.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:54]** You thrusted her.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:58]** That is a hit, so that's 2d8 plus 8.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:01]** 2d8 plus 8, so 10 points of damage.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:04]** I'm manifesting 1 and 1.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:05]** 5 on the first 8.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:06]** Okay.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:14]** 4 on the second, so that's 9 plus 8 is 17 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** Gross.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:16]** Gross.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:18]** Okay.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:23]** You thrust her and hit her over the head.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:26]** Just a classic slapstick.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** Oh, God.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** She takes 17 points of damage, which sucks.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** Thank you for that.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** All right, anything else?

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:37]** So you have 10% concealment, and what is happening in the empty square?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:41]** The cloud array is that.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:47]** It's just a cloud of nanites formed over three squares.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:56]** And then just one thing gives us concealment, and then I can also take a 10-foot guarded step as long as I am adjacent to one of these squares.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:56]** 10-foot?

**[01:00:56 - 01:01:01]** Yeah, so my guarded step could be up to 10 feet because it kind of swishes through the cloud.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:02]** Gross.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:02]** Okay.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:03]** All right.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:03]** Sounds good.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:03]** Swish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** Swish, swish, swish.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:05]** Swish.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** As they say.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:07]** Swishy swish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:09]** Because you're guarded by the cloud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:12]** Because you're guarded by the cloud.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:14]** You got a cloud guard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** Guarded by the cloud.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** By the cloud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:17]** All right.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** It's Officer Astara's turn.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** What does she do?

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:21]** This is a good question.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:22]** Who does she want to take out?

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** Who does she want to take out?

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:27]** She might jump down in the ring.

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:32]** In fact, I am positive that she's going to jump down into the ring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:35]** going into the octagon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:38]** She's going in to the octagon.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:40]** That's rectangular.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** That is rectangular.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:51]** Okay, she walks forward into this rectangular gun and she is going to, I believe, is it climb to go down?

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:54]** I wrote the DC to go up, but I didn't write the DC to go down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:56]** She could jump face first.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** Yeah, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:57 - 01:02:00]** Yeah, no, that's actually probably the best.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:04]** That's usually what most people do.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:31]** um as they jump and just belly flop onto a hard surface i mean that's what they do in wrestling that you know you're not wrong you're not wrong that would be really cool uh no she is going to use her athletics to climb down oh yeah that's right that's a separate move action though right yeah that's a double move so she's down on the ground and that's it yeah that's it

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:43]** But she but she still needs to roll a DC for an athletics check in order to get down to make sure that she doesn't file it And fall it was simple suck That was super suck, but she does wanna make it happen.

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:43]** I

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:46]** Yeah, she's fine.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:46]** She's got 25.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:47]** She's good.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:59]** She goes down and literally just like jumps 10 feet, lands, and as she does, she has pulled out as part of, you know, because she can move and pull out a weapon.

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:02]** She pulls out

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:30]** this sword that looks like it is made from all these gears and in the hilt you can see encasing glass this this like massive spring constantly being compressed as she is pulled out a second clock sword and it just it's like got this periodic ticking sound as she has jumped down to join the fray against you all kev you had a question


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:55]** oh i was trying to remember if entangled prevents you from doing a guarded step because you did a guard step with modens and she was entangled oh you're right you're right and if that's the case being in a table prevents you from doing a guard step no you just it's too late oh yeah no we did we just you i think we determined that you can't take a guard step for difficult for difficult terrain you can't alter it's difficult i think


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:55 - 01:04:13]** you are ensnared being entangled impedes your movement but does not entirely prevent you from moving unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing force you can move at half speed you cannot run or charge and you take a minus two penalty to your ac attack rolls reflects saving those initiative checks index base skills and ability checks

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:39]** i think we saw this in the rules channel for entangled i thought you're right and i thought that it was for a difficult terrain so if her whole movement was to move half her speed and take a five foot step that feels like she can move half her speed and do that i think yeah i think the distinction is difficult terrain specifically says it counts as two squares of movement right which negates like being able to take the garden step aspect of it

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:43]** But nothing about entangle says that she's in a guard, that she's only that she can move at half speed.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** Yeah.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:45]** Right.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:47]** Which means you can, so she can, all right, moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:48 - 01:05:11]** yeah good point we'll bring this up we'll ask the the paralegals it's all good maybe something will be on my side for once i hope one day all right here's what are you doing uh it's your turn bunch of people down in the pit yeah yeah here's it's gonna keep up the pressure with those uh magic missiles on uh we're gonna take out the ads and he shouts it too not that anyone has to listen but take out the ads

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:12]** because he plays a lot of MMOs.

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:13]** All right, so it's 17.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:14]** 17.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:15]** 17.

**[01:05:15 - 01:05:17]** It took a rolling animation.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:18]** 17 more damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:20]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:20]** Jeez.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:20]** All right.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:22]** Wow.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:22]** All right.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:24]** Cool.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** Against this Wetzel.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:26]** Amazing.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:26]** Amazing.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:27]** And it goes down.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:32]** It does not go down, but it takes a lot of damage and looks really pissed.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:33]** Is it living?

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:35]** Yeah.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** Good stuff, good stuff.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:38]** It is Effecta's turn.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:42]** Effecta is going to... Dr. K, you're behind her.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:43]** She is no longer sickened.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:46]** She was sickened for that whole round, right?

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:53]** She was sickened for... She got sickened on this first round, so then she... She's sickened for one round, so does that mean that she'd be sickened now?

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:55]** Now it should end, right?


## Speaker_0

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:57]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:58]** It should be over.

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:00]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:03]** Like, I feel like... Did it affect her, though?

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:06]** She just couldn't make, like, an attack?

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:07]** Yeah, she was just sick and had a minus.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** Wouldn't it be at the end of the Wetzel's turn, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:11]** Yeah, I think for one round is the end of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:13]** Yeah.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:14]** The turn of the caster.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:14]** Good point.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:14]** Thank you.

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:15]** She'd still be sickened.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]** She'd be sickened still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:18]** She's still sickened.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:25]** And when you are sickened, she unfortunately... Okay, you're good.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:26]** She just takes a minus two.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:29]** But she can take a guarded step back.

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:31]** And she's going to try and take another...

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:33]** Where does she want to go?

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:35]** She can't go anywhere without blocking here.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** She knows that this is up.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** I don't think she has a melee weapon.

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:40]** I think she only has the needler pistol, Dr. K, right?

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:42]** I think that was the only one that you had given her.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:49]** Yeah, so she's going to say, she's going to look behind her and say, I'm sorry, here's... She could do unarmed strike, though, no?

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:53]** Yeah, she could, but it just doesn't do as much damage as the needler pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:55]** Why are you apologizing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:56]** Because now I'm in your line of fire!

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:58]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:58 - 01:07:00]** That's pretty unfortunate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:02]** That is pretty unfortunate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:03]** Well, he has magic missile.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:03]** He can get around her.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:04]** Come on.

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:04]** He's a pro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:05]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:05]** Sorry.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:06]** It's cool.

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:08]** All right.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:09]** That is a.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:18]** That is an 18 against the Wetzelt, which does hit the Wetzelt.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:22]** Doing more damage to the Wetzelt.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:24]** And it was a tactical, right, Dr. K?

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** It's a D4.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:27]** Yeah.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:28]** Of damage.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:32]** D4 damage, plus she has her own, plus 5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:35]** Oh, I guess it's whatever her...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:37]** Yeah, plus her plus.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:38]** Cool.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:40]** That is seven points of damage.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:43]** That was more effective than I thought.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:46]** And the Wetzelt is looking not great.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:47]** Looking not great.

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:51]** Let's else turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:53]** Wait, pause.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:55]** Paralegals confirmed.

**[01:07:55 - 01:08:02]** Our thoughts on that was that Entangled does not prevent you from doing a guard step.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:05]** Did I say that properly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:11]** I guess my confusion is it's like the only thing you can do in your turn is move.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:12]** You can move at half speed.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:14]** But you can't do anything else, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:17]** No, in Tangled, you can still do anything, but your movement is limited.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:19]** It's because you're kind of ensnared.

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:23]** Like, your movement is just... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:33]** I think it would be hard to take a guarded step while ensnared, but... I mean, I also still disagree with the ruling about the difficult terrain, and it's only on a technicality.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:34]** But you're wrong, John.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:36]** You're wrong on that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:38]** Yeah, but I play by the rules, so we're doing all right.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:40]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:46]** It's like, I disagree with the spirit of it, but I get why it's a game reason to do it.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** But we all have our opinions.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:57]** Alright, the Wetzel is going to, I think, stay on Effecta, because Effecta just attacked, so it's just like... She's like, damn it, I should have stayed in the closet.

**[01:08:59 - 01:08:59]** Oh!

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:01]** God, that's a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:03]** Uh...

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:06]** Yep, that's a natural 20.

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:10]** I'm glad it's on the random NPC that we saved instead of one of us.

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:11]** Yeah, that's good.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:13]** Sorry, that's Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:14]** I feel a little bad.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:15]** Pragmatic.

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:21]** Okay, that is 25 points of damage.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:24]** She is not looking great.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:30]** And she has critical bleed, so she takes three more damage on top of that.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:31]** She's dead.

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:32]** 28 points.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:33]** She's not dead.

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:35]** 28 points of damage, and she's bleeding.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:37]** Yikes!

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:41]** She will be if we don't do anything about it.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:42]** Yeah, not great.

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:42]** Not great.

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:44]** All right, top of the round.

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:45]** Top of round four.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:47]** Top of round four.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:48]** What's going to happen?

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:50]** What is going to happen here?

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:56]** I know what's going to happen.

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:59]** It's Orvier Pike's turn.

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:01]** It's Orvier Pike's turn.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:09]** He is... Yeah, he is ready to f*** some s*** up.

**[01:10:09 - 01:10:12]** So, first thing first.

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:15]** Takes a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:36]** step forward wait what's the double cross sword things that you just revealed yeah what is that that's the uh wisp i'm calling oh yeah i forgot about the wisp ballet it does follow him by the way mm-hmm that was a note that ac2 like reduces it by two i think for the first person to attack each turn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:37]** Was it each turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:41]** First person to attack after my turn for like four rounds, I think.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:42]** Four rounds.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:42]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:43 - 01:10:47]** Yeah, we can figure out all the durations and stuff later.

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:48]** Later.

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:49]** It's fine.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:51]** Oh, man.

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:54]** What does Orvier Pike want to do?

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:54]** Nothing.

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:55]** What does he want to do?

**[01:10:55 - 01:10:56]** I think he's going to step up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:57]** He's going to go, I got you.

**[01:10:57 - 01:10:59]** I want you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:07]** He's going to aim that knockdown advanced railgun at Rick19.

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:08]** Of course he does.

**[01:11:10 - 01:11:10]** Of course.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:12]** He's got to roll a miss chance.

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:13]** Let's see what happens as he rolls.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:17]** There is a 10% miss chance.

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:17]** Thank you.

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:22]** Let's roll and see if he misses first before we even figure out.

**[01:11:24 - 01:11:27]** Does a 26...

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:31]** Go against you or EAC.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:31]** Yeah.

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:32]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:32]** KAC.

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:33]** KAC.

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:35]** Both.

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:36]** Both.

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:39]** He got an 82 on his D100.

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:39]** Yeah.

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:43]** Okay, Rick19.

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:47]** That is going to be my good sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:49]** Not bad.

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:50]** Only 28 points.

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:51]** Nine points of damage.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:51]** Nine.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:52]** Okay.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:55]** So only eight points of damage because I have my force field.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:56 - 01:11:57]** Great.

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:57]** Awesome.

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:58]** Killer.

**[01:11:59 - 01:11:59]** You're good.

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:00]** You're good.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:02]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:02]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:10]** He's going to tell Bernice to stick with the APs for now.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:14]** And so she's going to actually come up following.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:16]** Here's his advice.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:24]** And like kind of button hook around this corner here and shoot at the wet soul.

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:27]** Meanwhile, Dr. Okay.

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:30]** Is going to apply a field dressing.

**[01:12:31 - 01:12:32]** Oh, all right.

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:34]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:39]** Oh, well, I think it ended after the Wetzel's turn, so she's not sick anymore.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:41]** No, but she's... To heal her.

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:42]** To heal, yeah.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:43]** Oh, thank you.

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:43]** Oh, my God.

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:44]** Yes, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:47]** Is she into hit points, or is she still into stamina?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:51]** She is... Yeah, I mean, she's in hit points for sure.

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:51]** She's low.

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:57]** She is 18 out of top 75, but she's a little lower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:57 - 01:13:00]** I'm going to roll to heal her first real quick, just to see...

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:01]** Okay.

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:02]** Ooh.

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:05]** So that's ten points back to her.

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:05]** Solid.

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:08]** Rolled a six plus my HP.

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:11]** Or plus my key ability score, which is plus four.

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:12]** Nice.

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:17]** So for 10 points, she gets back out of that 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:17]** Oh, yeah, Doctor.

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:18]** Okay.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:19]** That feels great.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:21]** Have you considered opening up a shop for that?

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:23]** Are you feeling okay?

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:24]** I'm feeling a ton better.

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:24]** Thank you.

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:25]** All right.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:26]** Meanwhile, this thing's like.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:27]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:29]** And then Bernice fires off.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:32]** Rules a 16 again to hit the wet cell this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:33]** Okay.

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:34]** 16 to hit the wet cell.

**[01:13:35 - 01:13:35]** EAC or KC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:36 - 01:13:37]** I believe EAC.


## Speaker_0

**[01:13:37 - 01:13:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:39]** Ooh, meets beats.

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:40]** Nice.

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:42]** Nice.

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:44]** Making some progress on this wet salt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:45 - 01:13:45]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:46]** How much damage are you doing?

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:49]** Roll high if you want to kill it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:49 - 01:13:51]** Roll low if you don't want to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:51 - 01:13:52]** Seven points of damage.

**[01:13:53 - 01:13:54]** Seven points of damage.

**[01:13:55 - 01:13:56]** It is still up.

**[01:13:57 - 01:14:00]** But it is barely hanging on.

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:02]** Barely hanging on.

**[01:14:02 - 01:14:03]** Amazing, Bernice.

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:04]** Amazing turn.

**[01:14:05 - 01:14:05]** Healing people.

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:08]** Taking people to the brink.

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:09]** Colin, what are you doing?

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:11]** You're kind of surrounded.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:12]** You're a little outnumbered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:15]** Colin is super duper surrounded.

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:18]** Oh, one last thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:19]** Yeah, sorry.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:20]** I think I can do two.

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:21]** Because I didn't.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:22]** Dr. O.K.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:22]** didn't.

**[01:14:22 - 01:14:23]** Oh, never mind.

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:24]** I'm sorry.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:25]** Cut.

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:25]** Cut that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:26]** My bad.

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:27]** All good.

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:30]** You have a lot of action economy to think through every round.

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:31]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:32]** No worries.

**[01:14:32 - 01:14:32]** Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:33]** Clarifying question.

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:43]** If I shoot through the nano, like nanite surge shield, do the enemies have a missed chance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:47]** I don't think so.

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:53]** Um, the way it feels, it's, it says, uh, it provides 10% mischance.

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:58]** It doesn't provide enough consumer to hide and your attacks ignore any mischance.

**[01:14:58 - 01:15:00]** So it's my attacks.

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:03]** I don't know if it's your cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:04 - 01:15:04]** Uh,

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:08]** Unless you make an offering to the nanites themselves.

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:09]** Right.

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:11]** And say, hello, I am friends with Kevin.

**[01:15:12 - 01:15:13]** We are one.

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:19]** Maybe you get betrothed to one of their kids, set up a happy relationship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:22]** You only get one nanite, and there's like millions of them.

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:24]** There's literally billions, so it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:26]** Plenty of fish in the sea, as they say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:27 - 01:15:29]** Plenty of fish in the swarm.

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:42]** So Colin takes a half step down, and I'm going to keep working on Dr. Nodin's... Clearly, her will is not to be broken.

**[01:15:43 - 01:15:45]** Let's see what her...

**[01:15:46 - 01:15:48]** KAC looks like.

**[01:15:50 - 01:15:51]** Let's find out.

**[01:15:51 - 01:16:00]** I'm going to sling a wrench from one of the shelves behind me at Dr. Nose using telekinetic projectile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:02]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:05]** Okay.

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:05]** And?

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:08]** Target making a range attack against its KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:09]** Okay.

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:09]** Okay.

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:13]** Let me ask Dr. Nodens what her KAC is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:14]** All right.

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:15]** Got it.

**[01:16:15 - 01:16:20]** Ranged attack is roll plus what?

**[01:16:20 - 01:16:23]** Ranged attack is just plus eight.

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:24]** Cool.

**[01:16:24 - 01:16:26]** So 16 against KAC.

**[01:16:27 - 01:16:30]** 16 against KAC, you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:38]** You needed just a little more.

**[01:16:39 - 01:16:39]** Flies past.

**[01:16:40 - 01:16:41]** Misses.

**[01:16:43 - 01:16:43]** Rough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:46]** You're still incensed.

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:47]** Your foot still hurts.

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:50]** I guess he'll move back into the club.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:51]** Okay.

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:52]** All right.

**[01:16:53 - 01:16:53]** Move in, move out.

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:56]** Just a little hokey pokey action.

**[01:16:58 - 01:17:01]** Just your old classic tactical hokey pokey.

**[01:17:03 - 01:17:03]** All right.

**[01:17:04 - 01:17:05]** Hmm.

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:06]** What to do?

**[01:17:07 - 01:17:07]** What to do?

**[01:17:07 - 01:17:08]** What to do?

**[01:17:08 - 01:17:08]** What to do?

**[01:17:08 - 01:17:09]** What to do?

**[01:17:11 - 01:17:12]** Who does she want to attack here?

**[01:17:12 - 01:17:13]** She's got some options.

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:17]** She's got some things going.

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:18]** Some things hanging.

**[01:17:18 - 01:17:18]** You know?

**[01:17:18 - 01:17:20]** She has some things to think about.

**[01:17:21 - 01:17:22]** What does she want to do?

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:29]** I think that she would like to... Yeah, okay.

**[01:17:30 - 01:17:30]** Okay.

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:45]** She is going to pull out an injector pistol, and she is going to fire it at Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:48 - 01:17:52]** Well, dang, that's a low roll for my attack of opportunity.

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:57]** 17 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:57 - 01:18:00]** She provokes attacks of opportunity with a ranged weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:00 - 01:18:01]** Yeah, because she's within 10 feet.

**[01:18:02 - 01:18:05]** Against, yeah, 17 is a hit.

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:06]** Against KAC?

**[01:18:07 - 01:18:08]** Against KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:08 - 01:18:08]** Yes.

**[01:18:08 - 01:18:09]** All right.

**[01:18:09 - 01:18:11]** That's what Colin needed.

**[01:18:11 - 01:18:12]** All right.

**[01:18:12 - 01:18:13]** Yeah.

**[01:18:13 - 01:18:17]** So, yeah, she goes to shoot and Rick just kind of catches her with the pole.

**[01:18:18 - 01:18:21]** Catches her arm as she's drawing it.

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:22]** Catches her arm.

**[01:18:22 - 01:18:23]** That was only a one on that roll.

**[01:18:25 - 01:18:27]** That's a two on that roll.

**[01:18:27 - 01:18:31]** So three plus eight for 11 points of damage.

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:33]** 11 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:34 - 01:18:35]** Too much.

**[01:18:39 - 01:18:39]** Okay.

**[01:18:40 - 01:18:41]** Too much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:42 - 01:18:46]** I thought you were saying too much isn't past the amount of her remaining.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:46 - 01:18:47]** No, unfortunately not.

**[01:18:47 - 01:18:48]** No, unfortunately not.

**[01:18:48 - 01:18:50]** She's like, oh, God, that hurt.

**[01:18:51 - 01:18:52]** And she pulls out her weapon.

**[01:18:53 - 01:18:54]** Fires still.

**[01:18:54 - 01:18:55]** A booper on the nose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:55 - 01:18:56]** Oh, God, no.

**[01:18:57 - 01:18:58]** Please stop hitting me in the head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:58 - 01:19:02]** It's the last thing that I need.

**[01:19:02 - 01:19:30]** 22 against case that hits that's a hit okay rick 19 that is a cool 12 points of damage okay that's 12 actual points of damage there yeah okay wow that is that is actually 12 points of damage like reducing it or anything okay okay that's good that's good rick 19 will you do your turn oh mischance thank you oh yeah roll this chance

**[01:19:36 - 01:19:37]** She's a good shot.

**[01:19:38 - 01:19:39]** Yeah, she was trained about stewards.

**[01:19:39 - 01:19:41]** Rig 19, it's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:41 - 01:19:42]** It is my turn.

**[01:19:43 - 01:19:43]** Yes, it is.

**[01:19:43 - 01:19:47]** And I think I'm going to do a full attack.

**[01:19:48 - 01:19:50]** You're going to do a full attack.

**[01:19:50 - 01:19:54]** Confirm this is not a archaic.

**[01:19:54 - 01:19:55]** No, what's the word for it?

**[01:19:55 - 01:19:56]** Unwieldy.

**[01:19:56 - 01:19:57]** No.

**[01:19:58 - 01:19:58]** Yep.

**[01:19:59 - 01:20:00]** So, yeah, I'm going to do a full attack.

**[01:20:00 - 01:20:01]** Let me see.

**[01:20:02 - 01:20:03]** Full attack.

**[01:20:03 - 01:20:05]** Let me see you full attack.

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:06]** It's a minus four to each, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:08 - 01:20:08]** Yep.

**[01:20:08 - 01:20:09]** Minus four to each.

**[01:20:09 - 01:20:09]** Let me know.

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:10]** Let me know.

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:11]** Okay.

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:14]** Against Dr. Rail Note Ends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:14 - 01:20:15]** So the first one is going to be.

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:16]** Ow.

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:17]** In the face.

**[01:20:17 - 01:20:18]** I'm terrible at flipping coins.

**[01:20:20 - 01:20:24]** I'm terrible at flipping coins.

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:25]** Where did that one go?

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:30]** Oh, that's an eight on the die for a total of 16.

**[01:20:30 - 01:20:31]** Oh, no, sorry.

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:32]** That's only 12 points.

**[01:20:32 - 01:20:33]** 12.

**[01:20:33 - 01:20:34]** That misses.

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:38]** And this one is a...

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:41]** 9 plus 4 is only a 13.

**[01:20:41 - 01:20:43]** That was a terrible idea.

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:44]** So what's the toe?

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:46]** No, I missed both times, right?

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:47]** Oh, sorry.

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:48]** Missed that.

**[01:20:48 - 01:20:50]** It was a 12 and a 13.

**[01:20:51 - 01:20:52]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:55]** They are tough to hit.

**[01:20:55 - 01:20:56]** They are very tough to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:56 - 01:20:57]** No, she's actually very easy to hit.

**[01:20:57 - 01:20:57]** That's the problem.

**[01:20:58 - 01:21:00]** She's a 17 to hit.

**[01:21:00 - 01:21:02]** But Rick is going through something.

**[01:21:02 - 01:21:02]** Yeah.

**[01:21:02 - 01:21:04]** Something's happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:04 - 01:21:05]** You're going through something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:05 - 01:21:08]** I should not have full attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:21:08 - 01:21:09]** Should not have full attack?

**[01:21:10 - 01:21:10]** Never doing that again.

**[01:21:12 - 01:21:15]** Well, it is Officer Astara's turn.

**[01:21:16 - 01:21:20]** Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom.

**[01:21:20 - 01:21:29]** This spinning blade clockwork sword is just zoom, zoom.

**[01:21:29 - 01:21:31]** In your ear, Rick.

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:33]** So she steps forward?

**[01:21:34 - 01:21:37]** She takes a step forward, a guarded step.

**[01:21:37 - 01:21:38]** You did not say guarded.

**[01:21:38 - 01:21:40]** She takes a guarded step forward.

**[01:21:40 - 01:21:41]** You moved her.

**[01:21:42 - 01:21:43]** I did not say guarded.

**[01:21:44 - 01:21:45]** She can take a guarded step forward.

**[01:21:46 - 01:21:47]** I also would let you do the same.

**[01:21:49 - 01:21:51]** Like, I forgot that they're reached.

**[01:21:51 - 01:21:53]** Then I would let you do a guarded step.
