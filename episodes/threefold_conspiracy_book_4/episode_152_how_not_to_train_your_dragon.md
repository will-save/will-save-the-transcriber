## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** And we were humming Miley Cyrus.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** Clap, clap, and syphilis?

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** Like, were you plating the two?

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** You got syphilis as well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:03]** Thank you for getting nearly a spit take out of me, Benny.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:07]** As I exhaled into my wine, it then landed on my eyes.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** And, yeah.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:11]** But it felt good because I have no AC right now.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** So I'm kind of burning up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:15]** So it felt nice to get a little splash.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** Stay Dewey.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:20]** Guys, we're in episode 152.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:23]** Are you doing the refrigerated face masks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:23]** 152.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:24]** Oh, no.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** That's a good idea.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** I should do that after this.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** That'll feel so nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:30]** Face masks in general are dope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** They're so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:36]** The ones that we have in our fridge are pretty amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:39]** Now I kind of just want to banter about skincare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Are they like the ice pack gel?

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:43]** Or is it like a moisturizer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** But you put it in the fridge.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** You store it in the fridge.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** It comes in a Tupperware box.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** I got the Kiana ones when I was in Japan.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** I bought like 40 of them.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:57]** I found them in the store that I needed and they were...

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** They're incredible.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** Top tier stuff.

**[00:02:59 - 00:02:59]** Top tier stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** What were we going to talk about, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** That's a great question.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:05]** We could still talk about it.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:07]** We could still talk about the thing that we were going to talk about.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** Let me just.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** Oh, that crashed.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** But, you know, it didn't crash.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** The banter topics.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:15]** Let's roll and see what we got.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** Coming in hot.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Killer.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:19]** I like it.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** Let me scroll down.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:24]** Okay, this one coming in.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** It's scroll.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** It's scroll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:33]** Well, I guess for whatever reason, Google just stopped in general.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** Great.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** I guess the internet's about to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:38]** The internet is just the whole thing.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** The whole thing's gone.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:39]** Nah.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** Sweet cornbread.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** Sounds really good.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:15]** Okay, fair.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:18]** For myself, it really depends on

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:26]** As we've stated on the occasion, the size of the potluck.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:26]** True, true.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:34]** If there are any vegans around, I'm not going to be bringing a bunch of short rib, right?

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** I've done large.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:40]** Wait, you said if there are vegans, you're going to bring a bunch of short rib?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** No, the opposite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** Oh, you said, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:46]** I'll do like a lentil dip for vegans.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:48]** Sounds good.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:57]** And I've done, I did like a sous vide short ribs for three days.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:03]** And I'll break out the blowtorch and finish them with a blowtorch, which is pretty cool.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:06]** It's like kind of a crowd.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** A slow braised sous vide short rib.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:08]** Yeah.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** Yeah.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:12]** It falls apart off the bone.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** Yeah.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:17]** I've had some of Will's sous vide stuff.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:17]** It's pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:19]** Yeah.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** Yeah, it's hella good.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:23]** I might do a brisket like Vinny.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:27]** I might do any number of things.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:34]** Even just like if we're doing sides, I might do like, I don't know, Brussels sprouts with bacon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:38]** Brussels sprouts with bacon sounds real good.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:43]** You do bring up a good point, which is it a main or is it a side?

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** So maybe you have different answers, everybody, right?

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:46]** Yeah.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** what you're tasked to bring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:57]** I've also done, I went to a Thanksgiving one year and it was kind of like, you know, you should bring something to Thanksgiving if you're invited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:57]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:02]** And they had never, I was talking to the host and they had never had pecan pie.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:04]** So I picked up six pecan pies.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:05]** Sweet.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:08]** With the last of my pecans from my grandpa's farm.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** It was pretty sweet.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:11]** That's special.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:13]** They're probably bomb.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:14]** I love pecan pie.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** That might be my favorite pie.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:19]** Except the thing that I would bring, which is a maple cake.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** Actually, so favorite pie, pecan pie.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:29]** But Ariel made this maple and pecan vanilla cake for my birthday.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:33]** Dead simple, but just with the right maple syrup.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:36]** Which, by the way, as I found out, doesn't necessarily come from Maine.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:39]** It actually comes a lot now from Vermont and from Canada.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:41]** Vermont maple syrup is pretty brilliant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** Yeah, it's bomb.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:45]** Maine has pivoted to blueberries, which they're really good at.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** They grow really well on the coast.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:49]** That maple pecan cake.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** If I was bringing a dessert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** Don't sleep on Florida blueberries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** Yeah.

**[00:08:52 - 00:09:05]** If I was bringing a side, my mom makes this like tortellini salad that is like cold tortellini, a little bit of feta, a little bit of Italian dressing that you can maybe make yourself, a little bit of chopped onions.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** And that's kind of it.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:09]** And they're like really small and it's tasty as f**k.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:34]** So it's gonna warn you right now John if you ever bring that to our house We will say that it's not good just because it's not Canadian maple syrup But so so what say it's not good But John I'll buy you a book of maple leaf stickers that you can just Look at this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** Product of Canada.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:41]** Look, if We'll Save starts moving some Canadian maple syrup in the back, you know, that's fine.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:43]** If that's what we got to do, that's what we got to do.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:45]** You know, just got to be a distributor for the Southwest.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Got to pay the bills somehow.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:46]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:50]** Hey, did you know that they make a Canadian maple syrup Coca-Cola?

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:51]** No.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:52]** It's really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** I'm going to slam that.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:56]** That sounds great.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Thank you.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:00]** Kev, Kelly, any dishes on your mind?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:03]** I'm just going to get mine out of the way so that I'm not disappointed.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Because I don't cook.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** So, like, I just... I really don't.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** Not anything that I would be willing to bring to something.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** So then, like...

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:15]** What I would attempt to do is like there's something my aunt makes.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** It's really incredible.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:20]** And it's called Touche Pie.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** Well, that's what she calls it.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:24]** It's actually French Canadian, apparently.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:29]** But like she makes it because she used to live in the hat of America.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:31]** We have a lot of Canadians in the Discord.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** So she lived up there for a while for whatever reason.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** I can't remember in the middle of nowhere.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:56]** and then like she made like uh she made that and she makes it every now and again it's the most amazing thing so i would steal the recipe from her and then lock her in a basement or something why do you need to walk her to visit well i don't know she might get mad is she not forthcoming and she might try to stop me oh what is she not forthcoming so then the family recipes

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** Yeah, actually, I don't know.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** It's a good question.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** I'm going to ask her for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:12]** That sounds like a fun DLC of Overcooked where you, it's like a Halloween version, you know, where like you have to lock your evil family member and then try and finish the thing before they break out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:27]** yeah there's like a phasmophobia aspect where like you've got to run away so you don't get like your neck snapped by your ancestors what is a what is phasmophobia and why do i probably know that i have it phasmophobia phasmophobia you're basically like supernatural ghost hunters it's a video game

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** And it's a game on Steam.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:35]** And you've got to go in and figure out what type of ghost it is before it kills you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** Dude, why have we not played this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** I was watching streams of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:32]** Yeah, you're running a store and you have to identify up to five individuals who come in to buy things.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** But here's the thing.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:37]** Doppelgangers are running rampant throughout America right now.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:44]** So they'll give you their card, and you have to determine whether they're doppelganger or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:47]** Yeah, whether they're skinwalkers or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:54]** This sounds so much like... Who was the one playing the game where you're a Russian passport checker?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:54 - 00:13:06]** I saw one stream of the Midnight Shift where the ID was written in brown crayon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:11]** It was so obviously faked.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:15]** But then what I want to know is, because you also have to run the store, so you have to stock things.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:18]** And then when they try and get in, you have to lock the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** So anyway, I started blasting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** Lights go out, you're hiding in vents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:30]** But then you have to mop up and clean up the skinwalker parts.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** I love that.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:34]** It's actually a convenience store.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** I am down to play that.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** That and Phasmophobia sound great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:43]** You're actually operating a real peripheral in an alternate universe.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:43]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:44]** Yeah.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:44]** Yeah.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:46]** Horrible.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:47]** Horrible.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:50]** Good job derailing us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** Yeah, no, that was good.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** Kev, did you have anything that you wanted to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:54 - 00:14:16]** so i'm a terrible cook i i do i can't believe macaroni and cheese most time um but however i will say my wife usually handles the the potlucks this last one we went to the fourth of july thing and um she made a really good uh pasta salad real simple you know just noodles and classic cucumber or whatever um cucumber

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:21]** I think the one thing that I could do that I have done before is my aunt's fudge.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:27]** She has this really good fudge recipe that's just very buttery.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** It's the best fudge I've ever had.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:31]** And I've had all sorts of fudges from all around the world.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:36]** So, yeah, it's just a very heavy butter, soft fudge.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** Sounds great.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:38]** Fudge is so good.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:40]** That's what I would bring if I had to.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** Fudge is so f***ing good.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:43]** Dude, great choice.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** No nuts, though.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:46]** If you want nuts, you got to do it yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** I like nuts in my fudge.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:50]** But that does remind me on a serious note.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:55]** My grandfather passed away last fall, but last summer when I was hanging out with him, he made a bunch of fudge.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** He was just like, it was something that he made as a kid.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** And he was like, I don't know.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:58]** I just want some fudge.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:03]** And I always remember he'll like, he would look outside in the morning and be like, I think it's going to rain later.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:08]** You don't make fudge on a rainy day because of the air inside changes.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** Cause of moisture.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** Yeah.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:10]** Yeah.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:10]** Yeah.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** And so then I was like,

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:11]** All right.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:14]** This feels like one of those things where I'm like, I didn't even think about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:17]** Because water will seize the chocolate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** Yeah.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** It's like, yeah, of course.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:22]** You don't make fudge on a rainy day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** I won't make that fudge on a rainy day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** Don't do it.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:34]** That's why when you're making chocolate covered fruit, you pour the chocolate on the fruit instead of dunking the fruit in the chocolate.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Because the moisture will seize.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** It'll lock up the chocolate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** Lock up.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** Lock up the chocolate.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:44]** Well, if there's anything that you like to make at Potlucks, let us know on our Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:46]** I also get done with a meat and cheese tray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:51]** You're a good meat and cheese tray.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:51]** Yeah.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:51]** Fresh fruit.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:51]** Sorry.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:55]** I was listening to STF recently on their SPA, which is the Shadow Protection Agency.

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:56]** I recommend it, too.

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:00]** But they were talking about...

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:03]** How one of them has a charcuterie.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** That's what they do for their birthday.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:06]** Charcuterie birthday.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** That's a good idea.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** I want to go to that.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:09]** It's a great idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** It's a great idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** Everything else is covered.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** Bring the appetizer.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:13]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:14]** Exactly.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:15]** Yeah.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:20]** So if you want to let us know about either food that you eat or food that you like or what you would bring.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:23]** then hit us up on the Discord.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** Discord.We'llSavethePodcast.com.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:32]** I don't know, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** I don't know.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:33]** It's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:36]** Discord at We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:39]** No, just Discord.We'llSavethePodcast.com.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:40]** Thank you.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:44]** Yeah, but he said, like, you can search it in such a way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** The at was a mistake.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:48]** The at was a mistake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:48]** I don't know, man.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:49]** Don't add us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** It will.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:30]** That's not us.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** And you were listening to us now.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** Yeah, I've run into that as well.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:33]** We just thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:36]** If you got this far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** If you're listening by accident.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** Thank you for listening by accident.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:47]** If you're 10 to 15 minutes into this episode and you meant to listen to Pod Save America, thank you very much.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** Welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** We're Will Save the Podcast.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** We get all the way off the rails.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:52]** We get confused all the time.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** All the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** We're also not just saving America.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:56]** We're saving the entire universe.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:56]** Exactly.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:57]** That's the difference.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:59]** That's why we're better.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:04]** And with that, I'm going to roll an eye to see who I'm sending the subscriber sentence to.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** Which one of you?

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** Fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** Did we ever get the other subscriber sentence?

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:08]** We did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:10]** Somebody was supposed to do it.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** They never did.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:12]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** I did.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** But you know what?

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:18]** If I do say so myself, it was so well integrated.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:18]** It was.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:21]** I didn't even notice it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:24]** We're supposed to announce it at some point in the show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** Announcing it right after it's done is not wise.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** I think it should be done in the next episode.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:36]** It depends on how obvious it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:39]** Sometimes you get a shoehorned in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:43]** What was the one that Will did that was like... I don't know.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** We were all caught off guard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:48]** It was... I feel like that's happened several times when Will gets it.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:50]** He does not shoehorn it in.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:54]** I mean, he probably went ahead, looked, and found the best moment in his time travel herself and then put it in.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:55 - 00:19:03]** There was one time that Will did it, and all of us were confused, but we bought it, and then he was like, that was the right end.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:05]** I was like, oh, that makes sense.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:07]** That makes a lot of sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:09]** Will has the benefit of hindsight, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** He does.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:10]** Yeah, it's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:13]** Because he exists outside of time and space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:15]** Hindsight is a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:17]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:19]** I like that very much, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:21]** Hindsight is a natural 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** That's going on our shirt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** That is great.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:29]** The one from the last episode was Have You Ever Seen a Grown Sharon Cry?

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** Well, if not, you're about to.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:36]** And that was by... That was... Taco Monk.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:38]** Taco Monk.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:39]** Taco Monk.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:41]** Taco Monk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** Taco or taco?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** Oh, come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:44]** No, it's taco.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:46]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** I'm just starting arbitrary arguments.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:49]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** If it's taco month, please let us know.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:56]** With that, we should keep going.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** One quick thing.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:58]** One point of order here.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:01]** We do have a form.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** Plot armor.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:13]** is on the horizon so if you would like to ask any question about book three or maybe it's something about book two that you think connects to book three or book one

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:14]** And let us know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** Or any question about what we've done.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:17]** Yeah.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:18]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** Could be unrelated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:22]** Go to our Discord to ask those questions.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:22]** Right.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:24]** So we have a form there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:28]** We also have a link in the episode description for this.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:32]** So whatever you're listening on, Overcast or Spotify or whatever, then use that.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:33]** Click on that.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** It's a Google form.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** Fill it out.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** Give us your name.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:38]** We would love to know who you are.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:40]** Fake names also totally welcome.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:43]** So you can just say that you're a taco monk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** None of those Bart Simpson ones, though.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:47]** Seymour Butts, not taking that one.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:47]** Only use that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:50]** Only use that.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** Anything else?

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** Any other shout outs?

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** Because I want to get going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:55]** Sweet.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:55]** Great.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** I love it.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:04]** Shout out Nico Hulkenberg, who got his first podium in like 230 races at Silverstone.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:07]** Talk about persistence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:10]** I don't know what any of that means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** Nico, if you're listening, thank you.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:14]** And well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:18]** Thank you for listening to Pod Save America.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:21]** Thank you for listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:26]** God, we're so good at putting fries in the bag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:32]** Why we don't have a collaboration episode with Pods in America yet is beyond me.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** We need to reach out to them.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** Yeah, we're very poignant.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:42]** We are your search entry partners when you search the podcast and save.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** We'd love to do something.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:46]** That's how that email goes.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:47]** All right.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** Fantastic, folks.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:48]** Fantastic.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:52]** Let us get... Oh, that music stopped real quick.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** Let us get into the app.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:56]** But, of course, because we're post-150...

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** Things are a little different.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:07]** So, you know what I'm going to say.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:09]** And that was my plug for Pod Save America.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Bleeped.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:14]** Yeah.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:18]** No, we are going to close your eyes.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** Oh, willing.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:22]** If you at home are able to safely, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** This is another Rick 19 going crazy episode.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** Rick 19 going crazy.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** Somebody else take notes on this because I can't.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** John, give me the notes on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:30]** All right.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** I'll just send you the whole thing afterwards.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:33]** Send you the whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** Take a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** Again, breathe in.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:36]** Breathe out.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** Relax.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:38]** Relax.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:40]** Just let yourself drift off into another universe.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** Another space.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Wake up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** Drift off super easily.

**[00:22:49 - 00:23:01]** As we start moving along, empty, dark windows at night, I'm envisioning a shot where you're slowly going along.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:08]** of a rather large building.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:17]** You see in the reflection several tall skyscrapers in the distance, as well as the little twinkling of nearby cute neighborhoods.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:30]** All this reflecting off the windows, these large windows that look into classrooms and study rooms, ready for the next day's students.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:39]** We move past a large lecture room, and then past private admin offices, dark, work waiting to be done.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:52]** And then past small closet offices of perhaps junior professors, until we start to see the larger, more established rooms and labs of the senior professors.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:59]** Many lights at Javone University are typically illuminated this late at night.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:03]** But tonight, we've stumbled upon an exception.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:12]** Only one professor's lab is awake, with a row of research lighting illuminating the lab table.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:21]** As the camera now moves into the space, and we see a desk lamp nervously shining its light onto a laptop.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:28]** The office is partially open to this decent-sized research lab.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:50]** There's the usual accoutrement and research paraphernalia, Erlenmeyer flasks, beakers, centrifuges, as well as a tall and extensive storage wall of what looks like maybe inert biological tissue you can see from some of the rows that are separated and labeled in these shelves with spinning handles that can move back and forth.

**[00:24:52 - 00:25:15]** On another side, you see even more lab tables, mostly clean, a clean workspace, but a few that temporarily holding boxes of what looks like party equipment, maybe some banners, some stringed glitter streamers.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:18]** And another box that has these youth lab kits.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:24]** That's next to a half-folded banner hanging outside of the box.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:32]** And you can see in bright yellow letters, it reads, JU Youth Culture Club.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** We come back to the laptop.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:40]** And we see a face lit up by the screen.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:46]** The aquamarine blue face with large orange spots covering one eye.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:50]** The face of an Osharu male.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:58]** Deeper blue stalks extend from the back of the head and turn translucent green as they get longer.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:11]** Their aquamarine skin is moist and clear, his face serious, but eyes shining with the quiet excitement of someone with a secret before it's shared.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:20]** It is the face of Dr. Aeon Boushdakis, played by Ben Mendelsohn.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** Alright, cool.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:31]** There's a pause as their eyes scan and a voice interrupts the moment.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:39]** How long do you plan to keep up this philanthropic charade, doctor?

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:42]** Gravelly voice interrupts.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:50]** The doctor's eyes, still looking at the laptop, then close in exasperation and then puts on a smile.

**[00:26:53 - 00:27:00]** Have you been too deep in the spreadsheets and the box ticking that you've forgotten that there are Osharus behind them?

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:08]** Osharus with families who have an interest in passing down their research as legacies.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:26]** A large Osaru, bigger physically than Dr. Boustakis, dressed in Javome's government-neutral dark green suit, closes the door quietly and leans casually against the frame just outside the nervous light of the desk lamp.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:35]** Their light green stalks sit neatly combed down over their beige skin, played by Liev Schreiber.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:42]** Always answering one question with another.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:48]** You know, Miura is loving your culture troupe.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:55]** By the way, Doctor, she raves about the crazy Dr. B and his wild experiments.

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:01]** Must have gotten that enthusiasm from her mother, Dr. Boushakis states.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:04]** She was right about the crazy part.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:20]** Tell me, Lero, where did you find time in your busy schedule to come here and inform me that you're cutting underfunded youth science clubs as they are now a threat to informational safety?

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:25]** There's a chuckle from Lero, the brawny Osharu.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** Quite the opposite.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:35]** Your lecture on cell chronological adaptability markers inspired her young brain.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:37]** Finally got her hooked.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:41]** Her teachers tell me she's actually engaging in class.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:43]** There's a pause.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** An implied thanks.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:49]** You didn't need to accept her.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:55]** All minds have potential, Lero, Dr. Brudakas says, kind of getting up, brushing away the thanks.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** Why are you perspiring?

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:03]** Dr. Brudakas walks over to a lab table with a rainbow of vials.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** Can I get you something to relax?

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:14]** I'm here because returning the favor and providing some inspiration...

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:20]** that will hopefully change your mind, or at least your behavior.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:27]** Dr. Boushdakis slowly sets down the vial and the partially filled syringe.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:31]** He imagines how easily that syringe could enter Lero's eye.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:37]** I'm concerned at your latest infocast, Doctor.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:44]** First, aligning yourself with the Union Coalition is a career killer.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:45]** Full stop.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:51]** JU is too conservative and must uphold their pedigree.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:56]** Non-Osharu will never serve on the Grand Council.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:58]** That is written in Javome's Creed.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:01]** They may serve in other ways.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:03]** Lero sighs.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:07]** Before you say anything, there is more.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:17]** Lero steps closer into the lamplight, and Aeon knows exactly how quickly the compound would take effect through the eye before Lero knew what happened.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:24]** There is no threat to our species' survival aeon.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:28]** Yara Issa will protect us.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:33]** Our kin have centuries of scientific momentum behind us.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:37]** The awards of countless innovations.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:43]** A research machine that the stewards only dream of.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:48]** Yara Issa understands what Javari uncovers, you know this.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:54]** Let's hope Yara Issa doesn't rest on her laurels like ISB does.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** Lyra's face hardens.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:04]** My team is going through your research and finding blatant disregard for certain protocols I own.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:18]** If you're going to fan the flames of extinction again, and someone does every few decades, then come up with a better solution than integrating non-Osharu DNA.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:24]** Osharu genetics is a variation on a theme, not incorporating new elements.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:25]** We are strong.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:32]** And at this rate, you'll end up even crazier than those biohackers out there in the edge communes.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:37]** Like Dr. Okakus, is his skin not strong enough for you?

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:47]** If he shares your thoughts, he's wise to not flip tables at committee meetings to prove his point.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:56]** Must be past Mio's bedtime by now.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** Lyra takes a step back.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:04]** I lied when I said I'm concerned.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:08]** It's made its way all the way up to Nazpatu.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:15]** They are finally cracking down on all these fringe theories.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:30]** I'm supposed to give an update to them in a few weeks, and it would be pleasing to share that this waves his tentacle all around the lab is only a university matter.

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:34]** If it's not, I won't hesitate to share what I know.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:42]** Leroy coldly turns away from Dr. Boushdakis' light and walks out the door.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:54]** Aeon unclenches his tentacle with a syringe, pauses, closes his eyes, and then injects just a little bit under his skin.

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:01]** Feels the edges of his tension melt away as you can see the tension around his eyes.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** The orange spot fade a little bit.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:09]** Suddenly, he feels a draft from the back of the room.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** Puts his attention on Edge.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** Who's there?

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** There are you back?

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:26]** He nervously shuffles forward, letting Pabak's moonlight and Javum's ambiance light his way.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:34]** Each step feels like a thousand kilos, but whether it's the little medication or his apprehension, he's not sure.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:44]** The feel and the sound of the wind starts to caress his skin as he sees just an open window at the back lab station.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:45]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:50]** He sighs, lets his tension melt as he closes the windows.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:53]** Never opened them once in my whole time here, he thinks.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** Shuffles back to his desk, sits down, rubs his eyes.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:03]** Too, too many decisions to be made in too little time to make them.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:07]** He opens his eyes and freezes.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:14]** There's a blank email draft on his screen with text.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:20]** It reads, You should have injected the syringe into his eye.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:28]** Send this if you want to take your research further and make your kin stronger than their kin.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:32]** There's no return email address.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:37]** Dr. Budakis waits, nervous.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:39]** Is this the Unity Coalition?

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** Is this an ISB trick?

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:43]** They are tracking me now, surely.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:54]** But his tentacle touches the mouse, and without thinking, slowly hovers the cursor over the send icon.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** When the door behind him opens and... Fuck!

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** Aeon shouts and closes the door.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** Oh!

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:04]** Dr. Bruce Jenkins, is everything all right?

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:11]** We turn and we see the slightly younger face of Dr. Kanto Okada.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:14]** Yes, yes, my apologies.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:17]** Although you know I love that word, don't you?

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:19]** Sorry, just focus.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:23]** My work closes the laptop.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** Let's jump to it.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** You feeling all right?

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** You feeling okay?

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** Ready to hop in?

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:29]** Yeah?

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:30]** Okay.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:31]** All right.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:31]** It's late.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:33]** We have the labs to finish.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:34]** We do.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:35]** We do.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** These DNA strands won't bond themselves.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Let's get going.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:39]** Let's go.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:46]** And they walk back into the lab to do their research.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** We come back.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** Come back to the present day.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** Kev, you're looking a little sleepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:07]** No, I'm... I wish I could take notes on all of that.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:09]** I'm like, there's so much thrown at us just now.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** We're supposed to open our eyes, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:15]** You can open your eyes now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** Yes.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:22]** I have to say, I don't want to f*** with Bouchdakis because he kind of sounds like a protagonist from a Guy Ritchie movie.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:29]** I don't know whose choice that was, but I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:34]** I think that was Will's choice.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:43]** Maybe we'll see more of Dr. Bouchdakis moving forward, but he makes some unhinged decisions a little bit at a time.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:45]** Yeah, that too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:49]** I feel like that was probably one of the reasons why Dr. Okada's Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:57]** Was drawn to him, you know, what theoretical biology researcher wouldn't wait, what, what theoretical biology researcher wouldn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:58]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:00]** Just take a little bit.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:06]** Yeah, setting up some conflict there at Javon University in Pabak.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:10]** JISB is the Informational Safety Board, I believe.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** Overseeing.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:13]** Will is nodding.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** Feel free to jump in as you are the resident expert.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:23]** But yeah, overseeing kind of the scientific creed, making sure that things are up to code.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:31]** Ethical enforcement arm of the research and scientific innovations on Javon.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** you can read a lot about Javome.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:41]** Actually, there's a, there's a good bit in near space for Pabok.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:47]** There's a, there's a nice little blur, but actually in ports of call, there's a whole, they, they, they really take that further.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:56]** And, uh, I just want to shout out like that's, that's a fun read about just all the industry and like, what would actually happen if you had this society?

**[00:37:56 - 00:38:06]** And it goes a bit more into like, you know, there's that, that thing that I wrote in, um, the Yara Issa uncovers what, uh,

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:34]** no yarisa understands what javari uncovers because javari is like yara isa is dr okay's kind of chosen god to work with yeah right yeah and yara for many oshars for many oshars right and it's like so yarisa is the god of you know science and scientific method just on a very first principle term but javari is this other osharu i think god who is like the god of like accidental

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:56]** discoveries you know when you design one thing and then it ended up working for something else so it's like the fact that dr bruce dacus maybe is not as adherent let's say to the tenants of yari's maybe a little bit more jovari who knows who knows word word word word word


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** Words.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:57]** Words.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** That's word podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** There's a lot of words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** There's a lot of words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:02]** Yep.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:06]** In that way, we are really no different than Pod Save America.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:06]** A lot of words.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** A lot of words.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** All right.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** Let's get back to it.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:13]** Let's get back to the fight at hand.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:14]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** I forgot we were fighting.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** Yeah.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:17]** Oh, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:17]** Yeah.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** Last episode.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:18]** It was just a fight.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:22]** I mean, it could be, you know, there's a pizza party behind that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** Yay, you won!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:29]** You're the one millionth customer at Terrapin Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:33]** Yeah, it was all a bad dream.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:38]** There's actually a potluck, and we forgot to bring food.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:41]** That's why we're in this conflict.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:41]** Fudge!

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** It never rains.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:49]** They say it never rains on Veros for whatever it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:51]** It's always fudge-making day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:55]** It's always fudge-making day on Veros for burgeoning fudge economy.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:59]** That's really the blue sky opportunity there for you investors.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:02]** Look, last episode, slugfest, honestly.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:07]** The stewards are in a cage match with Rick19 and Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** Pun intended from the flashback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:39]** lots of good hits back and forth lots of coordination from also I like how Dr. K, Effecta and Tears who still hasn't stepped in the room have decided to aid your friends and Dr. K is right on the precipice I'm going to bring you guys back to the map here Effecta is right on the precipice you've taken out the wet selt while Rick and Colin are trying to stand toe to toe Rick and Colin what health are you guys at?

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** Not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:45]** I'm sure he's fine.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:47]** I'm at 18 of my 44 hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** Colin?

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:53]** I just healed a good amount of your hit points.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:54]** You did?

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** Yeah, I was lower than that before.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** Yikes.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:00]** I'm at 33 of 48 stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:04]** Cool.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** I guess I'm burning more resolve points.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Balls to the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:10]** Wait, you're 33 of how much damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:10]** 48.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** Okay.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** Oh, so you're fine.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** You're good.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** You got a bunch of points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:16]** Yeah, I'm fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** You're good.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:18]** It's fine.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** It's fine, guys.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** It's fine.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:21]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:24]** Well, here's still pulling a Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:26]** Classic.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:26]** Classic.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:30]** I have done a great deal of damage in this battle.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** He has.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** So how it is done does not matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** From the nosebleeds, but that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** Yeah, that's how it goes.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:38]** It's called being a smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** Here's Steph Curry Fabricius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:41]** Yes.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** Three points whole way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:46]** Through some invisible field that like, oh, it wasn't his.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:47]** Yeah.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:50]** Why would I not use a ranged weapon if I have one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** Exactly.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:51]** Exactly.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:51]** Yeah.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:54]** That's what Dr. Nodin says.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:55]** Why not?

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:00]** Look, you did see her pull out and manipulate her data pad at one previous turn.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** Because we're in round seven.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:04]** And in the previous round, you did see her pull it out and manipulate it.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:22]** But now that Orvier is getting slammed with different conditions, and Astara with her cool second clop sword, and Dr. Nodens, who you think at this point, with as many spells that she's cast, who knows where she's at with her spell slots.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:25]** But her and Orvir nod, they're on the same page.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:32]** She presses a button to open a secret door at the north end of the room.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:44]** The door opens, this red and sickly green light spills out and there is a rumble from inside the room.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:48]** I'm going to bring us back into combat mode with this music.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:54]** Thank you, Sirenscape, for always transporting us audially to the places that we want to go.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** Couldn't get there without you.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** It is round seven, Dr. Nosen's turn.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** She's used a move action to...

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:02]** Hit her.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:03]** Data pad.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:04]** Door.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:08]** It would be orally, not audibly.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:08]** Thank you.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:08]** Orally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:11]** This is a tricky thing.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** It's oro with an au, not an or.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** Orally.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** Yeah.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** Orally.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** Not orally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** Orally.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:18]** Orally.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** Yeah.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** Just be a pirate.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:20]** You're a pirate.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Yeah.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** Yeah.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:48]** early early dr nodens takes a five foot step closer to the wall and we are looking i believe that is everything that she's going to do rick 19 you are on deck about ready to go as she ponders what she's going to do what is going on wait well what what i i can't recall if i have a reaction or not do i have a reaction do you have a reaction she takes a good step


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** You're not in range anyway.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:54]** I have reach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** She's 15 feet away from you.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:03]** Your reach is getting a little bit too big for your bridges.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:05]** Your apprehension pole is not that big, Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:12]** It's only average size.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:12]** Hey, man.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:13]** It's Starfinder.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** You can always find something bigger.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** Find a way to make it bigger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:18]** Rick19, it's your turn.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:18]** What do you do?

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Consider surgery or attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** Rick's turn.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** Wait, so the door is open?

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:24]** Is there a dragon in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** You don't see anything at first.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:27]** We're 10 feet down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** You're 10 feet down.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** You're pretty far away.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:34]** But you do see just this haze come out of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:37]** Can I roll a perception check to know if that's a dragon in there?

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** Can you smell the dragon?

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:42]** There's this one missing dragon egg thing that's been...

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** I rolled a 15 plus 9.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:49]** Do you want to try and identify with a skill?

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:52]** Because perception is just a C. Or here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** Okay, hang on.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** Perception is to sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** You could see it.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:58]** You could hear it.

**[00:44:59 - 00:44:59]** You could smell it.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** You could feel it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:07]** So my 15 plus 6 for 21 on life science to understand what the grunt was?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** I would call that a roar instead of a grunt.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:11]** It feels a little diminutive of you.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** Yeah.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:14]** Yeah.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:20]** It does sound like the type of roar that would come from Virignus.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:25]** Virignus is the dragon from before.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:28]** I believe your only other dragon experience.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** Yeah.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:29]** Yeah.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:32]** It does sound weirdly similar.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** What do you want to do, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** It's not the same words, but it rhymes.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:36]** Is that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:45]** Rick would say into the comms that sounds a lot like our dragon friend from before.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:50]** Sorry, I'm a little drunk and that is not how Rick talks.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:55]** That sounds a lot like our dragon friend.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** I'm sorry, I'm still like...

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:04]** I'm actually very impressed by your acting skills, John, from previously.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:08]** Your Boosh Dogg accent is awesome.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** Thanks.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:20]** Anyway, so Rick would say into the comms, that sounds a lot like our dragon friend as he swings his apprehension pole at his average apprehension pole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:25]** That is natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** Natural one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:29]** You know, one in five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:33]** You just apprehend the dragon.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:35]** You apprehend yourself.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** You miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:42]** That's why you need the... You're grabbing your knee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** Right, yeah.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:57]** And the worst part is for the last week of mental prep for this, I was like, oh, I'm going to just use a serum of healing and completely forgot about that when I rolled this die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:01]** Orbeer's like, that's why you need once daily Cialis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:07]** That's why you need an enhanced Riechenpohl.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:08]** Wild.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:11]** All right, so I'm going to roll the critical fumble.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** Sorry, buddy.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** Here we go.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:13]** Ready?

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** Three, two, one.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** Go ahead and stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** Stop before you start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** First card.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** No, whatever you got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:23]** It's fine.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** That was kinetic, right?

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** That was kinetic, yeah.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:31]** Always wear hearing protection with your apprehension.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:34]** Always wear protection with your apprehension, Classpool.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** No, it's always wear hearing protection.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:46]** You are deafened until a successful medicine check to treat deadly wounds restores any of your hit points.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** That is wild.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** You are deaf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** What does deafened do?

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** I don't even remember.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** What does deafened do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:56]** Why don't we discuss the holy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:56 - 00:48:02]** Take a minus four to initiative checks, oppose perception checks, and you automatically fail perception checks.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:08]** The character who remains deafened for a long time is accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** So, yeah.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:10]** Fine.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:10]** Okay.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** I'll take that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:13]** How do you deafen yourself?

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** Wait.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:14]** Oh, no.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:14]** How do you... Oh, okay.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:17]** No, I just meant, like, how do you, like, overcome it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:20]** He goes to hit Orvier so hard that he just, like, boing!

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:24]** And the vibration, it's like a tuning fork next to his ear.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** Oh, and your metal.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:26]** Yes.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** Yeah.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** And your whole body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** The resonant frequency.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:36]** Dude, you hit the resonant frequency on this average size apprehension pole, which could have been any number of nodes.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:37]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:40]** If it was any longer, I wouldn't hit the resonance.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** You'd be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:45]** Yeah, because as we know, 10 feet, it really lines up with that.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:45]** Wow.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:50]** Glad I rolled that 15 for a worthless perception check or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:51]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** All right, you want to do anything else with your turn?

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:56]** Defric 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** Yeah, f*** it.

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:01]** I'm going to take a guarded step away from these two.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:03]** I can't hear s***.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** So I'm going to step towards... Okay.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:06]** What's her name?

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** Nodens.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** Not fake Nodens.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:12]** Nodens with a posture with air quotes.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** Nodens.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:13]** Nodens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** All righty, you take a step away.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:20]** Officer Astara, she don't like that.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** She's going to take a step forward.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:26]** The question is, does she attack Colin or does she attack Rick?

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:29]** Oh, oh, but she, what kind of step?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:29]** Guarded step.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:30]** No, she didn't.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:31]** She did not.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:32]** She just stepped forward.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:35]** John, you didn't say guarded step.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:37]** She takes a guarded step forward.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:41]** There's so many types of opportunity that I'm not able to take because you're just like, bop, bop, bop, bop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:41 - 00:50:08]** she takes a great step forward walking there she takes a great step forward yeah it sucks man i know it sucks it sucks it's it's i mean being strapped from the next room over just like to rush into yeah he's deaf yeah he can't hear you um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** Emphatically at Rick.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:14]** I will say, Rick slash Kev, if you want, we can do that.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:22]** I will then also just do the same for you all, which is if you don't say you're going to do... The minute that you say it, I'm not going to give any... There's no grace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** No, it's fine.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** I'll give it to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:49]** well if we decide that we want to do that then the precedent is if you say it doesn't matter if you're like oh wait no doesn't matter move the chess piece if if you've moved at all if if you said it i think typically we're a little bit more lenient than that but yeah

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:53]** With that, she's going to swing with her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:55]** Let us know in our Discord what you guys think about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** Exactly.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:00]** That's a 15 against.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:02]** She was going against Colin against KAC.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:05]** I believe that's a miss on you, sir.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:05]** Great.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** 15 KAC misses.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** Okay, sounds good.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Here's from Precious.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:12]** What are you doing from the half court?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** You are far.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** All right, let's see.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:20]** Here's a... The Westfield's still alive, is it not?

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** No, it's dead.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** It's all bloody.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:22]** Oh, okay.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** All right, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:29]** Actually, here's... Before you... Actually, you're good right now.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** You're good right now.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:31]** Oh, for now?

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:32]** Like, in what way?

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** For now, you are good.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** You are good, sir.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** Nothing.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:35]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** All right.

**[00:51:37 - 00:52:03]** uh all right here's it's gonna like you know roll to like create like an artificial geyser uh between again okay officer astara and orvier okay question is that it's not the guys you did last time can you move it or is it a one-time target because it's a fresh cast yeah yeah okay just curious let me rotate it let me take a second okay remind me again what happened

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:10]** All right, so what happens is Heirs creates a burst of pressurized boiling water from far away because he doesn't need to be close.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:17]** And this deals 3d8 slashing and fire damage and applies the burn condition for 1d6 to each creature in the area.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:21]** All right, in this case, it's 20 feet foot line that starts from wherever the he wants.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:29]** So he's just going to target Officer Astara, unfortunately, and then Orvir, fortunately.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** So he's going to do that.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** Um, and it's there within range.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** So here we go.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** That's what he's going to do.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:39]** Uh, now you need to cut, you need to, you need to, what is the word I'm looking for?

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:42]** Roll a reflex saving throw.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** And yeah, it's a DC 17.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** You got to pass that.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** DC 17 reflex saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** Have the damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:53]** Plus your, your reflexes are still encumbered and entangled and all that stuff.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** All those.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:55]** Right.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:57]** You have a ton of conditions right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** For Orvier.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:01]** Yeah, he is super duper messed up.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** Good.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:07]** I believe Officer Astara is okay for right now.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:10]** What conditions does she have at this moment?

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:12]** She is burning still.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:31]** so at the end of her turn does not stack right no I don't think so yeah it doesn't she's burning and Orvier is burning so I believe at the end of officer of stars turn she was supposed to she was supposed to take damage at the top of her turn which you roll here let's do that real quick

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:33]** And then she had a chance to reflex save, if that's all right.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:36]** Yeah, just a moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:38]** All right, so I'm going to roll a 1d6.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** So prepare your butts.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** So it's just a two.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:43]** But there you go.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** You can take two more damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** Hey, that doesn't hurt.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** Okay, cool.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** What's the DC to get out of burning?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Because she rolled a 16.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:52]** Seven.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** 17.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:54]** 17.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:58]** So she is still burning.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:02]** And then she needs to roll it for this geyser.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:06]** Okay, that is a 17 DC 17, so she passes that.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** She's good.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:10]** Okay, well, f*** you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:10]** Yes, indeed.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:11]** What about Warbeer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:17]** He is entangled and encumbered, which I believe does a lot.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** So, let's see.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:23]** I'm just going to grab those and see what the difference was to Reflex and Saving Throws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:25]** Also, you have that basic inhibitor, too.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:27]** But that's on your AC penalty, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** Yes, indeed.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** I got a lot going on here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:38]** We're doing our best here, but you know, he had it coming for being a complete app or just trying to do his job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** Well, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:42]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:47]** So it's, so it's a minus two from entangled and then it's a minus two again, will from your inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:48]** Sorry.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:51]** Minus two to your AC on the inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:57]** And I think I, did I do a, did I give you the trifecta?

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** I know I gave you a double dose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** Yeah, I think it's just a double.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:03]** You hit him with a discount double check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:05]** Yeah.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:09]** I thought I did a minor inhibitor too, but maybe I didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:10]** I don't think you did.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** He failed that save anyway.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** He rolled really poorly.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** So he failed.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** Astara succeeded.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** And he also is burning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** So what happens, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:24]** So Astara is going to take...

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:53]** seven points of damage and okay orbeer is gonna take 13. um and and of what damage from for both of them uh it's like slashing in and and fire for half and a half for both yeah and and now he is gonna have to like he i'm also gonna apply the burn condition to him for for one to six he already has the burn condition i think which doesn't say did he did he roll for damage this round


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:54]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:57]** His round already went because he's at the top of the round.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:59]** So, yeah.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:01]** Well, there you go.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:02]** Pretty dope, though.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:05]** Pretty good.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:11]** A star with a sweet sword that was given to her, passed down through the generations.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:15]** Such a story that we're... Don't humanize her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:17]** It's already that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:24]** I'm sorry, did you just say this sword came from her grandfather, so definitely don't loot it at the end of this fight?

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** That's what I heard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** That's exactly what I said.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** It is Effecta's turn.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** So cool.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:33]** Effecta is going to shoot again.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** She has the needler.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:39]** The needler from Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** Needler.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:40]** Needler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** Let's see.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:45]** It's a roll there using the sweet die.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:48]** That's a hit against Astara.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:48]** Astara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:49 - 00:57:12]** killing it against the star the question is does she kill star no killing it move touch the piece john i know i know oh god no no please don't set a precedent it's josh and tactical


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:14]** That was horrible of me.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** Apologies.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:17]** My Chrome is just deciding to be like, you know what?

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:19]** I could care less if I work properly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:26]** Or arc.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** I would love to use arc.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** That'd be cool instead.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:31]** She deals one point of damage.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:32]** No, sorry.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** More than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** Yeah, she's got at least a plus something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:44]** Yeah, she deals seven points of damage to Officer Astara, who looks on her last legs.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:46]** Effecta is finally effective.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:48]** And, yeah, that is rough.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:57]** Shot hits her in the back as she went to attack, I believe it was, Colin.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** So let's see.

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** Whose turn is it next?

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:02]** Ooh, I know exactly what's going to happen now.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:11]** Okay, at the top of the round eight, here's, I need you to give me, here's a Dr. Okay, give me, actually, sorry, just here's first.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:16]** Here's give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:16]** Okay.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:19]** And let me know what you get.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** No.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:22]** Okay.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** Never.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:24]** He got a 17.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:24]** 17.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** Okay, cool.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:26]** Sounds good.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:28]** All right.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:32]** That's probably okay.

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:33]** It's probably fine.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:36]** It's probably totally fine, guys.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:38]** I would not worry about it in the slightest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** Does he... Oh, yeah.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:44]** I'll wait for you to tell him what he senses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:44]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:45]** No worries.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:45]** You're good.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** What he senses.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** You're good.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** It's Orville Pike's turn.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:51]** What does he do?

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** What does one do when you're on your last legs?

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** And things are rough.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:59]** Things are getting... Things are getting real intense.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:26]** think whoever just goes all out i think he just he knows what he wants i'm gonna move this willowist behind him he takes a step up and rick this is just like a bloodlust of somebody who just has never ever before you ask it's a garden step kev don't it's a it's a it's a it's a it's it's a garden step come on we know this we already know

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:32]** Rick 19, his ferocity in his eyes, he is, he is ready to go down.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** He is fearless.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:42]** He cares about trying to win in like just fighting, just all out sweaty, bloody combat.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:48]** He's going to swing at you with his cloth as deep as he possibly can.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:50]** That's a 26 to hit.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** That hits.

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:57]** It's 15 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:58]** I'm still alive.

**[00:59:59 - 00:59:59]** That's surprising.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** Still alive.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** We can work with that.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:06]** It's technically only 14 points of damage.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:10]** It was technically a guarded step, so it's fine.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:14]** So... I'm just Josh.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:14]** We're having a good time.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:21]** The... The claw that he has just... I mean, it just rips you a new one.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:29]** It feels like he is, like, dug deep inside you to try to deal as much damage as possible outside of the crypt.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:29]** So deep inside you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:32]** Yeah, Rick is, like...

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:57]** on his last whim yeah he's in pain but he is you just see this like dedication in his eyes to stay up and keep fighting totally oh all right what's gonna happen next everybody what is going to happen next you hear two hits


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:13]** And then from out of this door... The shadow appears in front of you.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:17]** Casting even pretty far onto the lower cage match.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:25]** As out steps this... This like slithering...

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:35]** dragon that looks odd has this one large tail.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:37]** I'm going to reveal it right now.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:39]** Did they reptoid the dragon?

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:41]** I think they did.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** No way.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:44]** Can I show you the artwork?

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:46]** Let me show you the artwork.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** Show players.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** Show me players right now.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** Oh, my God.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:53]** This large tail, unusual blue, green.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** It's not there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** What does this snake people call?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:01]** What does this snake look like?

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:02]** It looks insane.

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:06]** It's sort of like... It's like a dragon became a genie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:10]** It just has two arms and a tail and no legs.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** Exactly.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:12]** It's just a dragon genie.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:13]** That's it.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** That's all it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:08]** We found your egg.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:09]** We found your kid.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:11]** Unfortunately... Found your kid.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:13]** Not our fault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:16]** An abomination.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:16]** Yeah.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** There was a lot going on here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:23]** I'm pretty sure the insurance is going to consider it a pre-existing condition, but you'll figure it out, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:25]** You'll figure it out.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:30]** Alright, I need everybody... I'm going to guess here.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:32]** This is a... Nope.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:38]** Let's see.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** A measuring tape, maybe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:40]** A reflex?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:42]** Sorry.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:49]** I'm going to put this thing on the map right now for its toying.

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:53]** And I need pretty much everybody within a 40-foot aura.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:54]** I was trying to draw the aura right now.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:56]** I just need a second to figure out what it's going to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:56 - 01:04:03]** That is everyone, including here's, from the back of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:11]** From the back of the room, I need you all to roll a... We'll save!

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:14]** You told me no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:14]** We'll save.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:19]** I was honestly trying to just measure the thing and put the thing in Kev, so sorry.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:20]** I told you no.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:24]** Right.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:27]** Here's you are shaken.

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:28]** Is this a Mac?

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:34]** Yeah, you are shaken, which means you take a negative two penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks and ability checks.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** You're shook.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:39]** My guy that is going to be for seven rounds.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:42]** Jesus shaken.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:43]** Yeah, dude.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:44]** It's a dragon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:45]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:46]** A crazy dragon.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:46]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:50]** That's done some... Crazy half dragon, half reptoid.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:51]** It's my hero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:55]** Half reptoid, experimental crazy dragon.

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:58]** And... Weird.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:00]** What does it do next?

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:02]** What does it do next?

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:06]** It's pretty pissed.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:10]** As it steps out, surveils exactly what is going on.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:12]** And...

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:16]** Ooh, Officer Astara is also shaken.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]** Oh.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:19]** For however much of her life.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:21]** Because did she know that dragon was there?

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:24]** Oh, she did not know that dragon was there.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:27]** Nodens is just burning everybody?

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:28]** Dude.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:53]** experimental dragon what does it want to do i think i know exactly what it wants to do attack nodens right uh get out of here yeah it recognizes nodens as the one that you know right exactly for sure it's got to be noticed it's got to be noticed i haven't seen the new dot jurassic park movie but i'm sure that's what happens right right right that's probably what happens all right

**[01:06:56 - 01:06:57]** I think it's going to breath weapon.

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:58]** I think it has to.

**[01:06:58 - 01:06:59]** That's the only thing to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:01]** With just Nodens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:02]** With just Nodens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:05]** It's a 30-foot cone.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:07]** 30-foot cone with just Nodens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:11]** This is going to get... Let's see.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:14]** Who is that going to get?

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:17]** Does it do that?

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:18]** No, actually, I know what it does.

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:19]** The entire pit orchestra, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:21]** Right, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:23]** It already stepped out and moved forward.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** And then I think...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:33]** What it does is it... Oh, does Bernice get a guard or an attack of opportunity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:36]** If it tries to leave, Bernice might get an attack of opportunity.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:37]** Does Bernice need to roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:39]** Well, no, because it had to move through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:41]** She doesn't have a melee weapon.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:43]** Oh, that's unfortunate.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:44]** That is unfortunate.

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:45]** Come on, Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:46]** All right.

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:48]** Switch blade to the back of the tail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:48]** Right.

**[01:07:48 - 01:07:51]** It's going to... Yeah.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:52]** It's going to cone.

**[01:07:53 - 01:07:56]** The cone is going to get... I'm going to rotate the cone.

**[01:07:56 - 01:08:03]** I can't rotate it here, but I want to rotate it so that way it gets... Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:05]** Does it emanate from a single point?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:09]** Yeah, it just emanates from the dragon.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:14]** This angle is going to be maybe this?

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:16]** No, let's see.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:20]** It's trying to get Rick and Colin and Effecta.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:23]** And Bernice.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** And Bernice.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:26]** It's going to kill Rick.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:29]** It might kill Rick and it might kill Bernice.

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:33]** Why is it targeting us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:35]** That's a good question.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:37]** That's a great plot armor question.

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:38]** That should have stayed in my head.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:38]** I'm sorry.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:39]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:41]** Because it's being controlled by Notans.

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:55]** It conjures from deep inside of its stomach just the worst breath weapon of fire, and it comes out as this green fire as it opens its mouth, and you see this little spark.

**[01:08:58 - 01:08:58]** Oh.

**[01:08:58 - 01:09:08]** and just unleashes this fire, I need Officer Astara, Rick, Colin, Effecta, and Bernice to all roll a reflex save.

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:11]** And I hope that you roll highly.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:13]** Astara did not.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:14]** 21.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:16]** Okay, that is a 21.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:20]** Okay, from Rick, 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:23]** Bernice is an 18 from Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:26]** Bernice rolled a 4.


## Speaker_0

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:33]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:35]** Does Bernice really die, though?

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:36]** Does Bernice ever die?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:39]** I mean, you can rebuild her if we survive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:41]** If you survive.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:44]** That's the real question, is are you going to survive?

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:49]** Do I tell you how many dice I'm rolling before or after I roll them?

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:50]** Roll it up.

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:50]** Just give us a number.

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:53]** Killer.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:56]** 17 points of damage.

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:57]** Not bad.

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:58]** Not bad.

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:59]** Not bad at all.

**[01:09:59 - 01:10:00]** A lot.

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:01]** Good enough for Bernice.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:02]** Right.

**[01:10:03 - 01:10:03]** 17 points of damage.

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:04]** Bernice, how are you looking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:10]** Seven over my total hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:11]** Seven over your total hit points.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:15]** Okay, which does not... So you're down, Bernice.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:16]** You are disabled.

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:16]** Bernice is down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:18]** Bernice is disabled.

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:18]** Okay.

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:22]** Would Bernice have not gotten my healing from...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:22 - 01:10:23]** Oh, good question.

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:24]** Good question.

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:24]** She was at full health.

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:25]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:25 - 01:10:25]** Cool.

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:26]** Good talk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:28]** That was 7d10.

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:36]** Well... And... Astara crumples to the ground.

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:37]** Astara is dead.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:40]** Officer Astara had... Oh, no.

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:41]** Had... But, okay, good.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:44]** She had two hip ones left.

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:44]** She's done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:47]** Goodbye, Astara.

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:49]** R.I.P.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:50]** Rick, 19.

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:53]** Colin, you are okay.

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:55]** Yes, you are good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:55 - 01:10:56]** Sorry, what was the number?

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:57]** 17.

**[01:10:57 - 01:10:58]** 17.

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:00]** What was the save, DC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:03]** I already halved it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:03]** It's 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:05]** Jesus Christ.

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:06]** Oh, 17 halved?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:07]** Yeah, I'm fine.

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:08]** 17 was halved.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:11]** 17 is into my stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:12]** Okay.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:13]** Rick, 19.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:13]** Oh, you're...

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:15]** Hold on.

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:18]** Let me put 17 on my and hit.

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:19]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:19]** That brings in a zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:21]** Uh-huh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:24]** Luckily, it's not like massive damage because it's like, you know, still.

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:28]** But you are now dying.

**[01:11:28 - 01:11:29]** So you lose resolve point.

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:30]** You drown.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:31]** Hit zero.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:32]** Drown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:32 - 01:11:33]** I don't think you drown.

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:34]** I think you're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:37]** Yeah, we've got this ballpoint.

**[01:11:37 - 01:11:38]** Stabilizing.

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:41]** Sorry, I'm not familiar with all the stabilizing stuff.

**[01:11:41 - 01:11:43]** You're unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:45]** You're unconscious and dying, right?

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:45]** Yep.

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:48]** So on your turn, you can spend a resolve point to stabilize.

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:49]** Rick19 is down.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:57]** Rick19, as you go down, one of the last things that you hear is Dr. Nodens.

**[01:11:57 - 01:11:58]** Yeah, that.

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:03]** You also hear the laugh of Dr. Nodens ringing in your ears.

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:10]** Dr. K, you just witnessed two people go down in front of you and you felt Bernice's connection go offline.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:13]** I will put Bernice's unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:17]** Yeah, she's down for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:17 - 01:12:18]** She's down for the count.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:21]** What do you guys do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:23]** It's your turn, Dr. K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:26]** Yeah.

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:33]** First, I want to see, you know, now that I've seen my friends go down.

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:34]** Yeah.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:41]** I want to find out what this creature is to the best of my knowledge.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:42]** Okay.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:43]** With a life science check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:44]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:46]** Give me a life science check.

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:48]** To identify any weaknesses.

**[01:12:48 - 01:12:49]** Okay.

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:51]** Yes, yes, yes, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:52]** Please.

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:54]** I rolled pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:59]** What did you roll?

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:01]** I got a 18 plus 16, so 34.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:03]** For a four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:04]** 34.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:06]** 34, yeah, sorry.

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:11]** Yeah, yeah, that's real good, dude.

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:12]** That's real good.

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:17]** That beats the DC because this is absolutely a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:39]** rare creature for sure so the dc was pretty high um would it uh would my knowledge of the theme of uh genetics and life science help me reduce that dc by five


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:40]** Yes, but you already got it.

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:41]** You were good to go.

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:46]** And that did reduce it because that's exactly what you see.

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:56]** You see that this thing has been genetically modified by many, many experiments.

**[01:13:56 - 01:14:01]** And you think some of the haze and some of the things that you're seeing from where you're at, you can see a little bit into the room.

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:07]** Seems like there's this extra power source that you're thinking, this is where a lot of the power was going there.

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:09]** And you can maybe see some labs.

**[01:14:09 - 01:14:13]** You see equipment that you recognize that you're like, oh, this has been.

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:29]** some sort of egg that was raised and experimented on transmutated, adding in other DNA, adding in other gene strands, turning this thing into a crazy bespoke novel experimental dragon.

**[01:14:30 - 01:14:33]** You absolutely get some feats about the dragon.

**[01:14:33 - 01:14:40]** You said you first, you get to, so you first want to know the weakness, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:42]** Yeah, if it has any weakness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:42 - 01:14:47]** It is vulnerable to cold.

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:48]** All right.

**[01:14:48 - 01:14:52]** So that means that it gets plus 50% damage of whatever cold hits it.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:56]** What is the other thing that you wanted to know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:58 - 01:15:04]** Any other attacks we need to worry about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:10]** Yeah, you have... I'll give you... Hmm.

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:29]** do you want a tax or do you want something else that is very yeah that is a key thing okay yeah from the way it moved there's a shimmer to it and you're like I've seen this before with the grays this thing is a little out of phase

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:40]** and you think maybe as Bernice was going down before Bernice was breath weaponed, you saw some data coming in and you're thinking quick decisions.

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:45]** You're like, okay, up close, I don't see any of that phase.

**[01:15:46 - 01:15:48]** From back here, I saw it.

**[01:15:49 - 01:15:53]** You think, all right, if I'm gonna hit it and not have a missed chance, I need to melee.

**[01:15:54 - 01:16:00]** If I'm gonna fire at ranged, shoot anything ranged, I'm gonna have a missed chance on this thing as it's out of phase.

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:03]** Crazy experiments going on.

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:05]** Good life science, Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:05 - 01:16:08]** What do you want to do?

**[01:16:08 - 01:16:12]** The next thing I want to do is what's the there's a ship in this hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:12 - 01:16:14]** That is the void crier.

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:16]** You would recognize that immediately as the void crier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:17]** Is it powered up?

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:19]** It is not powered up.

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:45]** okay that was that playing out the window but it's a good idea that i like what you're thinking yeah i was just gonna say like let's hit it with the spaceship guns right yeah um i think at this point dr okay seeing bernice go down uh you know she's not dead but she's out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:52]** By the way, Dr. K, this is a, like, it is not as old as Virignus was.

**[01:16:53 - 01:16:54]** It's still younger.

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:56]** It's on the younger side.

**[01:16:56 - 01:16:57]** Yeah.

**[01:16:57 - 01:17:01]** But it just has been f***ed with on a molecular level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:06]** I am... And there's, like, a crate here at the end of this.

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:07]** What is this thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:07 - 01:17:10]** Yeah, that's, like, just a storage crate that was left there.

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:15]** I believe Orvir crashed behind it and took a swig of his Mark II healing serum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:16 - 01:17:22]** All right, so I think what Dr. K is going to do is he's going to try and finish off Orvir real quick.


## Speaker_0

**[01:17:22 - 01:17:22]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:22 - 01:17:23]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:23 - 01:17:24]** Finish off Orvir.

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:25]** Finish him.

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:26]** Finish him.

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:30]** Go get some cover behind this crate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:31]** Okay.

**[01:17:32 - 01:17:33]** Finish off Orvir.

**[01:17:33 - 01:17:37]** Make this an almost... You're down to three combatants here.

**[01:17:38 - 01:17:40]** Two of them are on their last legs.

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:42]** You started at four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:43]** Yeah.

**[01:17:44 - 01:17:45]** And then, yeah.

**[01:17:45 - 01:17:49]** I mean, I really want to get Nodin's data pad.

**[01:17:49 - 01:17:50]** Good point.

**[01:17:50 - 01:17:50]** Good point.

**[01:17:51 - 01:17:52]** That thing looks juicy.

**[01:17:52 - 01:17:55]** I think that's going to be hard to do at this moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:17:55 - 01:17:56]** Who knows?

**[01:17:56 - 01:17:57]** From where I am.

**[01:17:57 - 01:17:58]** From where you are, yeah.

**[01:17:58 - 01:17:59]** Unless you have telekinesis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:59 - 01:18:01]** So attack Orvier.

**[01:18:01 - 01:18:06]** I rolled a 19 on the consummate cost of jet for a 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:06 - 01:18:08]** The consummate cost of jet laser pistol.

**[01:18:09 - 01:18:12]** Yeah, I think he has a bunch of minuses to his AC from that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:12 - 01:18:13]** It's not a laser pistol.

**[01:18:13 - 01:18:15]** It's covered in acid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:15 - 01:18:16]** Yes, thank you.

**[01:18:18 - 01:18:18]** That's what I said.

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:19]** That's a hit.

**[01:18:20 - 01:18:21]** Yeah, it is.

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:22]** Roll your damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:25 - 01:18:27]** Let me get my D8.

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:36]** That is 13 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:37 - 01:18:41]** Rick, as you fall, you saw Orvir standing over you.

**[01:18:42 - 01:18:48]** And maybe just before you black out in unconsciousness, you see it as the head tilts to the side.

**[01:18:49 - 01:18:53]** Tell me how you kill Orvir Pike, Doctor, okay?

**[01:18:53 - 01:18:55]** I think... Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:55 - 01:18:56]** Vinny's face.

**[01:18:57 - 01:18:58]** Just sort of like...

**[01:18:58 - 01:19:24]** there's an eerie calm to my shot absolutely as i bring up my costa jet so red the red dot is just like haloed around his face it's one of those like two moa hit you know circular red dots and uh i just see his face disappear from the house


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:19:26 - 01:19:48]** you have killed or veer Pike couldn't have happened couldn't happen to a better guy I'm glad you took out just as unhelmeted face cuz Rick wants that armor unfortunately armor the acid falls onto the armor it falls off no immediately just just on the face totally


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:19:48 - 01:20:00]** irreparable it's like his head came off and then you know he just sort of like crouched down and packed up his armor on the bits that the breath weapon didn't disintegrate the acid did


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:00 - 01:20:01]** That's what I'm saying.

**[01:20:01 - 01:20:02]** That's what I'm saying.

**[01:20:02 - 01:20:05]** Rick 19, I made you prone because I forgot that you fall unconscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:06 - 01:20:12]** And then Dr. K is going to be like, get out of the pit.

**[01:20:12 - 01:20:16]** Except the person that can hear him already knows that.

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:18]** And the other person can't hear.

**[01:20:18 - 01:20:19]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:19 - 01:20:20]** Because I'm deafened.

**[01:20:21 - 01:20:22]** I'm prone and deafened.

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:23]** Rick is dead and deafened.

**[01:20:23 - 01:20:24]** Or the unconscious part.

**[01:20:24 - 01:20:25]** Unconscious and deafened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:20:25 - 01:20:27]** Unconscious and deafened.

**[01:20:27 - 01:20:28]** Colin Eden brand.

**[01:20:28 - 01:20:30]** What do you do on your turn?

**[01:20:31 - 01:20:33]** Just is like pop.

**[01:20:34 - 01:20:36]** Some things are literally popping off around you right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:20:36 - 01:20:36]** Yeah.

**[01:20:37 - 01:20:39]** I'm I'm incredible term.

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:43]** I'm going to move between Nodens and Rick.

**[01:20:43 - 01:20:45]** Okay.

**[01:20:45 - 01:20:46]** Because f*** Nodens.

**[01:20:48 - 01:20:48]** Okay.

**[01:20:50 - 01:20:51]** I don't know what she's going to do.

**[01:20:51 - 01:20:57]** And I'm going to reach back and crouch down a little bit and put my hand on Rick's chest.

**[01:20:58 - 01:21:00]** Uh-huh.

**[01:21:01 - 01:21:01]** Bring him back.

**[01:21:02 - 01:21:03]** We need to finish this fight.


## Speaker_0

**[01:21:03 - 01:21:03]** Whoa.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:05 - 01:21:11]** And burns another resolve point to cast Healing Channel to heal Rick for 68.

**[01:21:12 - 01:21:14]** Oh, I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:14 - 01:21:15]** Oh, I said 68.

**[01:21:16 - 01:21:18]** Yeah, I was like, points of health.

**[01:21:18 - 01:21:19]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:19 - 01:21:23]** That's a thousand points of health for 25 HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:24 - 01:21:25]** Dang.

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:26]** Well done.

**[01:21:26 - 01:21:26]** Well done.

**[01:21:26 - 01:21:27]** Well done.

**[01:21:28 - 01:21:29]** Sorry.

**[01:21:29 - 01:21:29]** Say that again.

**[01:21:29 - 01:21:29]** For how much?

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:31]** Two five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:31]** All right.

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:33]** So you're back among the living.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:34 - 01:21:58]** for temporarily temporary prone though you are so prone what does prone do again rick it means you're laying on the ground reduces your ac but it also increases your dc for hitting your increases your your two hit on ranged but decreases your ac for uh yeah close you also drop all your weapons when you fall unconscious


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:21:58 - 01:22:00]** You did do that.

**[01:22:00 - 01:22:01]** You also pooped yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:22:02 - 01:22:04]** Yeah, Rick pooped himself.

**[01:22:04 - 01:22:06]** I like to think Rick pissed his pants.

**[01:22:06 - 01:22:08]** Do androids poop?

**[01:22:08 - 01:22:09]** He leaks some fluid.

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:10]** The banter for next week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:22:12 - 01:22:13]** Rick wears brown pants.

**[01:22:13 - 01:22:14]** Do they have a bidet?

**[01:22:15 - 01:22:19]** Do they have an android bidet?

**[01:22:19 - 01:22:20]** Dr. Nodens.

**[01:22:20 - 01:22:21]** It's Dr. Nodens' turn.

**[01:22:21 - 01:22:23]** She just saw her.

**[01:22:24 - 01:22:26]** She just lived one of her happiest moments.

**[01:22:27 - 01:22:54]** her see your die no that's sad but it's fine her child just came out to make her debut and dr noden saw rick 19 go down that laugh oh so good such a good moment as she takes a guarded step five feet towards rick and colin she's just not even focused on you at all

**[01:22:55 - 01:23:10]** She is going to grab her claw, reach down, and even though Rick opens his eyes, she reaches over to drag her claw against your neck as she is going to attack you.

**[01:23:11 - 01:23:12]** Is that a guarded step into that space?

**[01:23:14 - 01:23:15]** That's what I said.

**[01:23:15 - 01:23:15]** I did say it.

**[01:23:16 - 01:23:17]** I did say a guarded step into that space.

**[01:23:18 - 01:23:23]** Rick, with your minus four to your AC, that is a 22 against KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:23:24 - 01:23:24]** That hits.

**[01:23:24 - 01:23:25]** That hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:23:25 - 01:23:26]** That hits.

**[01:23:26 - 01:23:27]** Okay.

**[01:23:27 - 01:23:28]** I think you're going to be okay for now.

**[01:23:29 - 01:23:31]** I think you're going to be okay for now.

**[01:23:31 - 01:23:32]** We'll see.

**[01:23:34 - 01:23:36]** The question is, how much damage does she do?

**[01:23:38 - 01:23:45]** That slash comes and goes across your neck, dealing you nine points of damage.

**[01:23:49 - 01:23:50]** And you're still pretty low, dude.

**[01:23:51 - 01:23:52]** That is a rough place to be.

**[01:23:54 - 01:23:55]** What do you do?

**[01:23:56 - 01:23:57]** Rick 19.

**[01:23:59 - 01:23:59]** It's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:24:02 - 01:24:05]** I try to remember all the rules.

**[01:24:05 - 01:24:14]** I can't grab a weapon as I'm standing up because it says you can draw a weapon when you're moving up to your speed.

**[01:24:15 - 01:24:17]** Or standing up is just a move action.

**[01:24:17 - 01:24:18]** Standing up is a move action.

**[01:24:20 - 01:24:20]** Right.

**[01:24:21 - 01:24:27]** So Rick is going to just grab the apprehension pole and while still on the ground, swing it at...

**[01:24:27 - 01:24:28]** What's your face?

**[01:24:29 - 01:24:29]** Nodens.

**[01:24:29 - 01:24:30]** Nodens.

**[01:24:30 - 01:24:31]** Quote, unquote, Nodens.

**[01:24:32 - 01:24:34]** Come on, Natural Tony, please.

**[01:24:34 - 01:24:34]** Please.

**[01:24:36 - 01:24:40]** Oh, it's a 14 on the die, and that's a plus 8 for a 22 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:24:40 - 01:24:50]** For a 22 to hit against Dr. Rel Nodens, architect of your pain and architect of pissing you the f*** off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:24:51 - 01:24:51]** Uh-huh, yeah.

**[01:24:53 - 01:24:53]** Yeah, that's a hit.

**[01:24:54 - 01:24:55]** Oh, yay.

**[01:24:55 - 01:24:55]** Okay, good.

**[01:24:55 - 01:24:56]** That's good.

**[01:24:56 - 01:24:58]** So it's going to be 2d8 plus 8.

**[01:24:59 - 01:25:00]** All ones.

**[01:25:01 - 01:25:02]** All ones.

**[01:25:05 - 01:25:12]** And a five for nine plus eight is a 17 to 17 hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:25:12 - 01:25:14]** 17 points against the hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:25:14 - 01:25:17]** 17 points of hit against Dr. Nodens.

**[01:25:18 - 01:25:19]** So he opens his eyes.

**[01:25:19 - 01:25:28]** He sees this like claw coming down and feels it just tear into your, but he, at that same time he's reached his like hand is already laying on top of the pole.

**[01:25:29 - 01:25:29]** Yeah.

**[01:25:29 - 01:25:34]** And he just, he grabs it with one hand and brings it up and catches it with the other and just swings it back, stabs her.
