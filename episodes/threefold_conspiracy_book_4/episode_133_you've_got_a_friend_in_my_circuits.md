**[00:02:32 - 00:02:47]** So it all started at around one o'clock today where I was, you know, going over to my house that I'm renting to a kind couple who lost their home, which is, you know, fun, but also glad to help somebody out.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** And I'm, you know, I got to get all painted.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** I got all that stuff taken care of.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:54]** The last thing to do is change the locks.

**[00:02:55 - 00:03:01]** And I call, and I look in my phone for my trusted locksmith who I befriended years ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** What's his name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** Kim.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** Kim.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** He goes by his last name.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:09]** Anyways, he...

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:13]** I couldn't find his number in my phone because it's lost somewhere.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Different phone.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** And I was super bummed.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:22]** So I go online and I start searching for my local locksmith to see if I can find this guy.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:25]** He's not listed anymore or whatever.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:32]** And all the locksmiths within like five mile radius all goes to the same website.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:45]** So it's like key.me or whatever, some jerk who like said, hey, I will, you know, promote your locksmithing business and you give me a cap level, you know, whatever, he set it up.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:50]** This guy shows up an hour late.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:56]** He then, I catch him and I've got three locks, right?

**[00:03:56 - 00:04:01]** And I catch this dude YouTubing my freaking lock

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:05]** like a chump.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:10]** And I'm thinking to myself, what is this not happening?

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:13]** Anyways, I asked him, how much is it going to cost?

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** He's like, oh, my boss didn't tell you?

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** I'm like, no, man.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** How much?

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:20]** He said, come out here and take a look at my three locks.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** Oh, well, let me talk to him real quick.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Meanwhile, he's working on it.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:29]** He gets like three quarters of the way done or two thirds of the way done.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** And he's like, oh, it's going to be 380.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:37]** And I'm like, yo, 380 for three quick set locks.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** That's nothing, man.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:41]** It took you 30 seconds to do this.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:45]** You're going to charge me $120 a lock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** You could have bought new ones for less than that.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:47]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:47]** Exactly.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** I could have.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:54]** I could have bought and I looked it up, which I'm going to freaking do now because why the heck not?

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:59]** I'm going to buy the tools to freaking set a quick set.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:02]** It takes like $150 and some gumption.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** Anyways.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** And some gumption.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:10]** So I'm like, dude, you can't be charging me.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:13]** Anyways, I talk him down to like $360, which is still a rip.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:16]** And...

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:21]** He sets the final lock and I go to check it.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:22]** I check it and it looks fine.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:25]** I go to close it finally after he's left, he's gone.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** Just like puff in the wind, right?

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:29]** Yeah.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:33]** And he was like, oh yeah, I fixed your back lock.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:37]** I'm like, okay, you fixed it, whatever, like...

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** I'll go to check.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** Then I go to close it, lock up and everything.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:45]** And he, it's a fiberglass door.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:52]** And he just wrenched this thing down with like an impact wrench so that the cylinder is not going to move.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** Basically.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:58]** He's just like over tightened this thing to beyond usable.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:04]** And so you go to like close it and the pin doesn't release because it's just pinched in.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:07]** And so I'm like, are you freaking kidding me?

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** I didn't bring my tools or anything.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:16]** So I'm like, hey, can you come back real quick and just loosen this so I can get on with my day or whatever?

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** He's like, yeah.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:28]** First, I text his boss because you call the guy, and then he calls his guy, and then somewhere in the chain of command.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:30]** And then he calls Kevin Bacon.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** Yeah.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:33]** I was like, hey, how long is this guy going to be?

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:36]** Like, you know, it's like 15 minutes after I called him or whatever.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:38]** He's like, call him.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** I'm like, OK, I'll call him.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:40]** I call him.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** He freaking hangs up on me.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** What?

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** And then... What?

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** I call his boss.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** I'm like, yo, your dude just hung up on me.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:58]** Can you just, like, come back real quick or, like, have somebody, anybody in the area just, like, lend me a screwdriver to go get this... Like, mid-sentence hung up on you?

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:58]** Yeah.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** Or, like... Yeah, straight up.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:03]** Like, I was talking to him, like, hey, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** Can you come back and fix this?

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** He's like, uh, click.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:08]** Wow.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** So I, you know...

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:21]** Anyways, I wait the 30 minutes that after I go to his boss and I talk to him or whatever, 30 minutes, he's like, yeah, he'll be there in 30.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:25]** So I'm like, 30 minutes go by, call him back.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** I'm like, yo, where's he at?

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** He's like, call him again.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:30]** And I call him.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** He's like, oh, I'm going to be there in an hour and a half.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:38]** I'm taking him like, dude, I called you five minutes after you left.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:41]** And you went on like another job in the rain.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:29]** Like if you are somebody who's like installing, working on stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** I was fucking YouTubing how to do it.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:34]** You're a pro and you're YouTubing my door?

## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** He sounds like he's a new guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:38]** He sounds like he's a new guy.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** He doesn't know what he's doing at all.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:44]** But I just don't understand the five-hour window sometimes.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:46]** Usually it's from SoCal Gas.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** They'll be like, somebody will be there between 10 a.m.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** and 10 p.m.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** And I'm like, I get it.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:52]** Sometimes you don't know.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:55]** But is there a way to just shorten the window a little bit?

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** Just a little bit.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** At least one hour.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:01]** Just tell me one hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:18]** i i'm guilty because our house has uh a lock in the back that we don't have a key for and so it's it's and and the deadbolt in the front the same thing our our storm door so like those those locks are only ever locked when we're in the house

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:40]** um and then we have a key for the front door and a key for the bottom of the back door have no key for the sliding door just wait till grayson starts flipping that and you're outside like bowing the lawn or something yeah that's what i'm very very concerned about and i i think i told you guys the story about we were in the um the airbnb in california well yeah that that one had like a

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:48]** uh, a push button on the side of the door, like where the, the flat part of the door, where, where the bolt comes out had these two buttons.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** Cause that's how it was in the 1950s.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:53]** And Grayson was playing with the first day.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:56]** And I was like, dude, don't ever touch that again.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** Like you're going to lock us out.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:03]** And then two days later I put them in the car and I'm by myself and I'm already anxious as it is.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:06]** And I put the two in the car and I was like, I'm just going to go back and grab a soda.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** And I go back.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** And the door is locked.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:11]** Oh, dude.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:16]** I put the code in, and I hear, and it unlocks, and then I go to hit the handle, and the handle is just not moving.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** I screamed so loud.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** that the neighbor came out.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** He's like, is everything okay?

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** And I was like, my son locked the door.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** He's like, is he in the house?

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** I was like, no, he's in the car.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** He's like, do you have a key?

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:28]** I was like, would I be screaming if I had a key?

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** Like, no, you idiot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** Yes, I have a key.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** It's right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:35]** I was just screaming with joy.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:38]** Please think about that sentence.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:42]** Luckily, there was a door, a back door, and there was a lockbox somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:45]** Sir, I mean, this what?

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** And all the respect in the world.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** The f*** are you smoking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** Come back inside.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** Can I have some?

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** I actually don't.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** I don't want to.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:53]** You have to take a guess.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** Wow.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** I am sorry.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** It has been one of those days.

**[00:11:56 - 00:12:02]** Locks tend to be the mechanism, pun intended, by which some of these shitty days happen.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:10]** And speaking of locks, these you guys didn't have to overheat your door in order to get in.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:13]** Although that probably honestly would have been faster than your dude will.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** Yeah.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** Yeah.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** You could have just gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:20]** Thankfully, I have neighbors and they were home.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** And they were home.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:21]** Exactly.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:23]** And I can just do it myself.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:23]** Exactly.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:27]** Which is what we did to get this little hatch open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** Yeah.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:29]** Yeah.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** You went to your neighbor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** Ask the neighbor for some help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:34]** Your friendly neighborhood lava stream river.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** You're like, hey, cool.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:39]** Can we just do that real quick?

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:43]** Before we fully get in, I just want to ask you for what...

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:38]** Yeah, I'm curious about these droids that we're not looking for and how we'll handle this.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** And if...

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:47]** I don't know, maybe they're not friends of Rudy's and maybe we should have hit that emergency beacon.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:36]** So we don't know why they were in prison in the first place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:40]** We don't know if they know Nix and Kyra or if they were just working with them to get out of the prison.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:42]** Right.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:53]** And though these people are friendly, these, like, these, uh, I forget exactly what they're called, but like, um, Azers, like, I don't think it was a good idea to tell them everything, but here we are.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** It's fine.

**[00:14:55 - 00:15:00]** It's also just like they could tell other people, which could be an issue.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:00]** But here we are.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** We're going to deal with it.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:07]** And yeah, these androids, we'll see how that goes, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:12]** See, what's funny is I'm actively trying to dial back the paranoia.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:28]** Cause I think I'm, I'm trying to figure out where Colin's line is between like, I, I am the bearer of my own destiny and can like do what I need to do to get this done.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:29]** And like,

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:32]** this is the weirdest three days of my life.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:36]** I'm just going to drop the next thing in the bucket and, and see what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:43]** So like, I don't, it's like, are you, are you trying to curve the next problem ahead of time?

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** Or are you just like roll with the punches?

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** How much worse can it be?

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:49]** That's the, I mean, it can't be worse.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:49]** Yeah, it can be.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:50 - 00:16:17]** yeah it can't be it can be i think uh it's not that you can't tell them anything you just can be selective you can you can get people to help you without them knowing your entire story but it's all good um yeah yeah the other things we know is that the two we're a bit of a just like kind of group of people so i think on the aggregate so it's fine like we'll just deal with it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:25]** Rudy did tell us that two androids are a part of the android abolitionist front, which is good for you, right?

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:28]** Rick is a member of the android abolitionist front.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** At least he thinks he is.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:39]** There's been a few suspicious things that's happened to him in our time that I'm not quite certain anymore, to be honest.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:51]** But then again, it's like, was that just... So the whole thing with the computer in Terracal's base, he tried to message the AAF, but it didn't go through.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:58]** But that could have just been the steward's base filtering the internet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:00]** Who knows?

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Well, it's some friends for you.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** I'm just glad Rick has some friends.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:05]** Now, do all androids...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:35]** like kill a lot or is that just like a rick specific thing okay maybe you can no comment no comment okay well it's with this mixture sounds like kind of a mixed bag you're trying to be paranoid you're trying to share everything what are the relationships that you can do well this this is one of the things i was trying to bring up in the car of like the idea that nicks and these two these four people

**[00:17:36 - 00:18:06]** we don't know if they're connected to anything else if they're isolated because like they're isolated on this planet now they're in this this fire pit cave thing with this these fire gnomes and like they're connected to rose light like could they be connected to tricalis and yeah yeah there's some sort of palace thing it's weird yeah palace obscure was that again the palace obscura yeah palace obscura


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:29]** remind me what the that was we don't know please where was it mentioned though and when nixon cairo kept saying image oh okay cool cool they were trying to pass the test to get into the palace obscura yeah awesome yeah before we jump in i was doing a little uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:30]** Although this music is nice.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:33]** This little, like, slightly tense.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:34]** Not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:40]** Oh, I thought it was the theme from Law and Order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:40]** Oh.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:42]** No, it's just Sirenscape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:52]** Speaking of Sirenscape, I did have something for the next time that hears or Colin that you do detect magic.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:54]** Because you did it a bunch in the past few times.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:59]** I do have a nice little thing here from Sirenscape, who we are proud partners with.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** Y'all are f***ing fantastic.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:03]** If you don't know what Sirenscape is, go to Sirenscape.com.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:04]** Yeah.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:09]** This is the cue that I have next time you're like, I'm going to do Tox Magic, because that's how Colin talks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** I thought it was supposed to be the chainsaw.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** That's cool.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** I'm good with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** It feels good, right?

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** It feels good.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** And then it lingers a bit when you're trying to find it.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** It's a little drone.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** It's nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:23]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:23]** It's nice.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** It sounds like Halo plus a didgeridoo or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** It does.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:30]** Halo plus a didgeridoo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** Plus a didgeridoo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:34]** That old classic combo.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:40]** So last time you all were finally...

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:48]** reaching a place where you think, all right, this new friend of ours, Rudy has said, there's a place of refuge.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** Let's head there.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** You head down these cliffs.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:54]** Some of you for the most part, you, you make it with some damage to your vehicle.

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:06]** Uh, but you make it and you start examining this surface mind that seems to be both long abandoned and also recent at the same time.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:10]** It seems like some of the structures have shifted, um,

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:17]** And when you start to examine, you see that there's this dust that they seem to be collecting here.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:24]** You're not sure who were the stewards, pun intended, or not really intended, of the mine.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:28]** But you start examining.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:31]** kind of roaming around the site.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** What can you find here?

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** What's this place that you're supposed to take refuge in?

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:42]** You find a door with a hand wheel and a lot of good engineering and scientific method applied.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:47]** Made you realize that you need to heat up the door, superheat it in order to open it for it to unlock.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:54]** You start walking down steps and you come into this mine where there's a small settlement of Azers.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** There's these...

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** fire dwarves.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:06]** Their heads are literally on fire and they have this bronze and stone and deep silver skin.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:11]** And they're so pleasantly nice.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:15]** You all did these sense motives on them and they just seem very altruistic.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:17]** They want to help you.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:25]** There's their former employer and now fellow, you know, mine colonist Mirko and Ifriti.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:33]** And she welcomes you all to a table to break bread, to sit and eat first tea and then something stronger.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** And then she brings out a lot of potatoes.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:37]** And you all are talking.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:39]** You're sharing what's happened to you.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** And she also shares what's happened to them.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:52]** They seem to be a very loud voice against a very large and imposing government that sought to

**[00:21:52 - 00:22:19]** keep them down silence their voice and in that is when they escaped through a personal connection they had fortuitous serendipitous to come here and in the process lost Mirko's wife Neva and by lost I mean we don't know what happened to her so you're sitting talking and she says oh there's some people that I'd like you to meet


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:23]** I'm planning on telling you.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** And they just came out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:31]** And you turn around and there are two androids behind you.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** I'm going to bring you over to the map here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:40]** Okay, before we go any further, what if Rudy is just three greys in a trench coat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:42 - 00:23:05]** i mean we've had the three goblins in uh yeah essentially it was that back so uh one i think if if it was that big it would have to be like eight grays in a trench coat pretty large yeah and also i don't i don't think we've heard any grays speak


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Well, they speak telepathically.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** Didn't Rudy speak telepathically?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** Colin did.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** We've heard Grace speak before.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Wait, no.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:16]** That was the Bounder, though, right?

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:19]** We had that regular guy that was doing the experiments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:19]** Right.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:24]** There was the Bounder who was aggressively, animalistically talking to you.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:27]** And then there was the dude before the Bounder.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:30]** who was saying, give me your brains.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:31]** Yes.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:33]** Let me use your brain as a computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:37]** Was he verbalizing that or was he speaking telepathically?

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** Telepathically.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:38]** As greys do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:40]** Telepathically.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:44]** Greys can speak, we think, but you don't normally see them move their mouths.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:45]** Right.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:48]** I also, the grey in Unknown Treasures, spoiler alert.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:51]** Beep.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:52]** Yeah, beep that.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** Also spoke.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** Telepathically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** That's true.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:57]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** Just one of those hallmarks.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:05]** I mean, if we're going by that nature, here's could be a gray in a shirt and suit, right?

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** Because he can speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** Let's not start weird conspiracy theories.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:12]** Kevin one time was like, what's going on with this, Kelly?

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:16]** Like I remember about something seemingly not a big deal.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:16]** I don't want to.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:17]** What was it, Kelly?

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** What was it, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:22]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** All eyes on you, Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** Just big black eyes or actually just black eyes.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:26]** Yeah.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:26]** And then...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:49]** just like a little like shield you'd like take he pulls off eyelids it's like the day of the jackal really good uh not a great insight down there so as i turn up uh this ambient sounds maybe that sense of warmth that you were feeling the four of you

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:58]** And it gets a little cool as you realize that there are two other people here that you were like, oh, okay.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:03]** But you turn around and you see two androids.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** I'll show you both of their artworks.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:12]** One is dressed in a pretty decent suit.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** He's got a three-piece vest here.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** He doesn't have that.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:18]** But he's dressed in some pretty decent clothes here.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** I'm digging the futuristic Sheltos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:22]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:26]** And then, oh, the other.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:28]** Why can't I get the other?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:35]** So this guy has got a brownish chrome looking skin or bronze skin.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:43]** And then he's got light blue circuits kind of running all over his face and hands.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** And the other guy is a ginger.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** I don't see the other guy yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:49 - 00:26:15]** uh you should be able to there's somebody here it didn't pop up john where do i see him at you probably have to close the other one maybe oh actually i don't close oh no no yeah sorry there's there's there's only one image that i can grab at the moment but uh so they walk up when they came out they looked stunned for a second and then they smile and they both walk over to the table

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:25]** And the one, the slick-looking one, says, Hello, friends.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** It is nice to meet you.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:36]** I am Petey, and this is Del, and points to his comrade there.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:46]** I'm glad that you could make your way to Corundum and relax with the fine warmth of our friends here.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:50]** And Mirko raises a glass towards Petey.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:56]** What, uh, I might not have heard it.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:59]** I'm sorry that we are a little late.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:02]** What, what, what brings you here?

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:06]** And Stephen, Stephen kind of scoots over a little bit.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:09]** Petey goes to like sit down next to you, Rick.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:13]** And Dee continues to stand and just walks over to the edge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:18]** The one in yellow is Del?

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** Is that what you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:19]** Del.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** Yeah, Del.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:20]** Delamar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** Del.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:26]** Is he kind of slow and reboots arbitrarily?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:31]** Del, he doesn't talk.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:36]** Sorry, I just got a Del for work and I kind of hate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:42]** Hilarious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** Hilarious.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:49]** He doesn't speak, but he's just as kind and friendly and just kind of waves, smiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:54]** You'll have to forgive me, but I think we have a few things to ask you before we go any further.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:56]** Oh, okay.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** Yeah.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** What can I answer for you?

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:07]** He starts to take some of the drink and sip it, and Del does the same.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** Only eats steak fries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** What is your connection to Nyx and Cairo?

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** Oh, well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** We're jumping right into it, aren't we, Del?

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** And Del just kind of smiles.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:23]** Aye, Rick's not one known for foreplay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:29]** I'll keep that in mind for later, Winks.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Oof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** What the hell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:41]** They were friends of the moment, let's say.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:48]** We were able to escape the sauna, and then we parted ways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:51]** And why were you in the sauna in the first place?

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** That's a good question.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:53]** I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:55 - 00:29:06]** I don't know if this will surprise you, but we are AAF members, Android Abolitionist Front members.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:20]** We were imprisoned for looking a little too deeply into some connections on Roselight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:23]** We can get it to us later if you'd like.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:26]** I think we can talk about that privately.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:28]** And Rick rolls his sleeve up.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:40]** And there's a... There's a set of circuits that... They look like every other circuit on Rick's body.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:45]** But these ones tend to sparkle in a certain way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:47]** I...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:52]** He looks around, and then he looks down at his own arm.

**[00:29:54 - 00:30:00]** And then you see him just barely whisper a word.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** Everyone give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:10]** I'm not very perceptive here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** I rolled a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:14]** I rolled a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:18]** I rolled a 1 for a total of 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:21]** I rolled a one for a total of three.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Three.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:23]** Thank you, Will.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:25]** That was nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** Perception?

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:31]** 26.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** 26.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:36]** Will's sitting right across from him.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** And Will, you are the only one.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:42]** I think I'm just going to message you, Will, what he says.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** Message you on Discord.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** Just tell you what the word that he says.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** I'm going to open Discord now.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:49]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:50]** I didn't.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:52]** Well, actually, I can do a personal chat.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** Hold on.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:53]** Oh, no, it's fine.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** It's fine.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** I got it.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:55]** I got it.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** I got it.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** We have to upgrade our plan.

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** That's cool.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Anyway.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:01]** Cool.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:03]** Yeah, so he says that word.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:11]** And then, Rick, you see those circuits light up on his arm.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** And you've never seen that before.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:18]** And he says, are you also with the front?

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:20]** I am.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:26]** Can you say the word?

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Do I know the word, John?

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** You don't know the word.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** You start thinking.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:34]** Okay.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** Wait, what?

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** There's another step in the process?

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:46]** Like, yes, you can see, Rick, that they're, like, slightly different shimmering, but, you know, and probably Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** does, because Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:57]** has, like, telescopes for eyes, so he notices everything, but, like, everyone else, like, just is not, like, they are not as perceptive, and unless you really point it out, and you're like, what?

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:03]** And Petey says, Oh, okay, well,

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** I believe you.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** And he smiles.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:11]** He says, let's talk about that later.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:14]** I would like to talk to you about that.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** It's good to have you here.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:19]** And he kind of gingerly like reaches out and like pats you on the back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:22]** Can I roll a sense motive to see if he's telling the truth?

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:23]** Sure.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:26]** Rick finally has a friend.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:28]** That is a 32 for sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** He is telling the truth.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:35]** All of our eyes go red and we just start killing everybody.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** Hold on, hold on.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:42]** John, that's the first time we've ever rolled a sense motive and you're like, yeah, it's the truth.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:44]** Instead of just some vague fucking answer.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** It seems like.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:47]** It actually works.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** It actually works.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** Doubters of sense motive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** Doubters of sense motive.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** All it took was a natural 20.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:57]** All it took was a natural 20.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:07]** Look, I don't know how long you all plan to be here, but if there's anything that we can do here to help, I'm happy to help out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:12]** Oh, you've been just incredible in...

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:19]** helping to fashion and really spruce up the place and make it feel like a community.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:22]** They're really community-driven people.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** I've really appreciated that.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:26]** And Dale just hilarious.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** Hilarious.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:31]** And Dale kind of, you know, does little like, shucks, you know.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:33]** Is he a mime?

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** No, he just doesn't talk.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** He's just mute.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** He just doesn't talk.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:38]** You don't know why.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** So,

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:43]** I want to open it to you all.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:46]** What do you want to ask?

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:48]** Or do you feel like you want to take a moment?

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:53]** It's probably still closer to the end of the day, but is there anything else that you want to talk about here?

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:58]** They start to bring out some food and at this point you're starting to maybe have a dinner and eat.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:01]** Maybe you just have a normal conversation.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:03]** Maybe you're asking specific questions.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** What do you want to do?

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** Yeah, I think

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** Colin is, he's in a brand new environment.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:19]** And so he's, he's probably taking in the sights.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:27]** You realize that that smell that you all smelled, that smelly, smelly smell.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** What's that from?

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:30]** There's something about that.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:36]** That smell that you smelled back in the cave when you're like, I smell like industrial.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:41]** I smell like the, the scent of,

**[00:34:42 - 00:35:02]** of the ground and these these crystals now that you know and the the scent of lava the other smell that you all knew but you you just couldn't place it you're like i haven't smelled that in a long time it's ax body spray they all wear acts it's the weirdest thing androids wear acts it's just i just thought it was rick 19 ripping


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:10]** No, it's the smell of home cooking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:17]** There's just a moment where some of the food comes out and you're like, oh, that was the stew that's in that tent over there.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:20]** That's what I smelled.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:23]** That was that warmth, that bread that they were cooking.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** Like, yeah.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:27]** And they bring it out and you all are eating.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:36]** And I think at one point Mirko looks over kind of to the four of you and says...

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** We can talk about it.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:45]** I was going to take us out of the game for a moment.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:55]** You were talking about how like the smell of home cooking is like that missing piece that kind of brought them home and like...

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:59]** My, my mom cooks homemade, basically everything.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:04]** And she always, the kitchen is right on the front of the house and she always cooks with the window open.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:11]** And like the walk from the driveway up to the front door of my parents is such a like.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:13]** settling experience, even at 34.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** Like, don't live there.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:25]** See my parents as often as I do, but like the smell of home cooking wafting over as you walk into a place is just like, it's such a visceral feeling for me.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:31]** Like, thank you for that, for that picture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** Kelly, yeah.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** I love that.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:41]** So I just wanted to say that I agree with Vinny's sentiments on that regarding home cooking and stuff.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:51]** And I also wanted to add that this music sounds like, it's kind of like, it reminds me of like, and the whole environment too, but especially the music, that sort of midpoint of your adventure.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:56]** And in Lord of the Rings when they're in Lothlorien, it sounds a lot like that kind of music.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:59]** It does have that vibe, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** This is like a

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:08]** kind of like gearing up for the next thing in just a small moment of respite, as you like to say, John, not respite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** Is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** I know we disagree with that pronunciation.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** It's probably respite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:16]** I think it's a short I, but we'll argue that on the discord.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** Come join us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** Come join us.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:21]** Yeah.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** And also shout out.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:25]** I will just say it doesn't matter what I've eaten in the day.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:27]** If I'm at Ms.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:32]** Rodriguez's house and she's like, well, there's some stuff left in the pot there.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:37]** It's some like rice and beans or whatever else, you know, like some like juca, whatever.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** Like, yeah, cool.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:39]** I'm in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:39 - 00:38:02]** i made i made rice and beans and juliettes last night for dinner that's last anyway yeah anyway um i uh mirko i appreciate your hospitality yeah of course this is the first place i think we've stepped into uh and been received in open arms since uh i can remember that's for sure


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:10]** Well, we're happy to be that respite for you, you know?

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** Very happy to provide that warmth.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** That's what we do, whether we mean to or not, you know?

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** She's like trying to make a pun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:27]** Can I roll like a medicine check to see if I know anything about these creatures from my past studies?

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:31]** Sure, go ahead.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** Take her away.

**[00:38:33 - 00:39:00]** oh that's a 24 yeah so you're trying to do like life science or medicine or what uh i was doing because like i assume that these are refugees and they probably need some medical help and so like it was see it was gauging the situation whether that's something i could realistically offer or if like i didn't want to make an empty promise and so that was him checking like okay is this something that i can help them with or do i need to find some other way to contribute


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** I'll say this.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:05]** You, Lydia Searstone.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:07]** Lydia Searstone.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:10]** She's got a little bit higher of a voice here.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:13]** Lydia Searstone sits next to you.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:16]** She just talks to you.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:20]** Once she finds out that you're also a doctor, that there are two doctors here.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:23]** She is more than happy to talk to both of you.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:28]** Maybe you're playing a little of the dinner roulette here and Dr. O.K.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:31]** is sitting at the end or she comes over to sit with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:37]** She's telling you about all of their medical capabilities here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:49]** We lived by the skin of our teeth and I have to say that we were faster probably than, well, faster than a lot of starships out there, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** So we moved quickly.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:53]** Did we have an emergency bed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** Well, that wasn't really my purview.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:57]** But did I make sure that mine did?

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** Absolutely.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** And I had as much as I could stuff in there.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:03]** So if there's anything that you need, let me know.

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:04]** I'll say this.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** I would love a bit of your help, maybe.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:11]** Sorry, Dr. O'Cottis and Dr. Eden Brent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:36]** little bit help recalibrating some of the instruments here and obviously we can give you some supplies that might be able to help you out but it would be great if you could help i think two things one some of the long-term injuries that folks sustained there there's one thing that pharax i just got a cut that it's just not healing this is not the most uh let's see

**[00:40:36 - 00:41:04]** relaxing of environments right so it's a tough environment for the cut to heal especially as hot as we run and then also some of the mental health here of everyone leaving their home it might be nice to have just someone else to talk to so if you don't mind spending a little time walking around and I can point you to in the best direction that might be able to help heal provide some of that study


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** Does that sound like something that could be helpful?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Aye.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** That's exactly my wheelhouse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** Great.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** Great.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** Thank you both.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** Thank you both so much.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:23]** Again, they're all really happy to have visitors because you can imagine that they're here and they're trying to lay low.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:26]** And then Petey and Del come.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:29]** and they've welcomed them, and they've welcomed you.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** PD and Dell were prisoners.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:36]** And yeah, you're trying to figure out, you know, they've told you why, but you want to talk to them more, you want to know more.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:45]** Mirko at some point looks over, maybe to the people sitting next to her, you know, Dr. K, Rick, here's, I'm not sure where you're sitting, but Colin.

**[00:41:45 - 00:42:14]** basically says i was thinking we have not had just a whiff of a minute to go explore some of the machinery here from the actual mine you know we're fortunate that all this around us was here when we got here it might be nice none of us are really of the super savvy uh technological types and i know that there are some equipment

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:25]** right over there and points back off where you know that there's kind of this platform of steel in the middle of that crystal growth.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:31]** It might be nice just to get a little bit of help here so we know what we're working with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:36]** If there's anything here that we can use or reuse or any of those computers that we can use.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:41]** A bit more powerful than the ones that we have here to run.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:41]** If that's alright.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:44]** If I could impose on you, you know?

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:47]** I could probably help you with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:50]** And Dr. O.K.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:53]** speaking for him, he's also quite good at that.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** And this briefcase, and he kind of picks her up, is, like, Bernice.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** And Bernice is pretty helpful, too.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:02]** I can imagine she was, like, fighting him, like, trying to, like, get her down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:05]** She pulls out a knife.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:10]** Flirts it like the butterfly knife.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:10]** Yeah.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:14]** Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Bernice.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** It's a pleasure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** You hear, like, the R2-D2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** Do-do.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:22]** Yeah.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:24]** Just like it.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:27]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:32]** So.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:57]** dinner kind of starts to slow down some people go back to wrapping up their evening even though there's no circadian sense here they don't have like a sense of what time it is they still go by what the planet's time is just to stay aligned people start to walk away i'm gonna just unpause and and um yeah do you all do you want to talk to anybody what do you want to do how long you plan on staying what are you thinking


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:04]** Rick would definitely like to have like a private conversation with the androids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:08]** He's just going to make himself available as available as possible.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:11]** Yeah.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:14]** I mean, he'll be wary about the content on the computer.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** Anything seems like kind of weird.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:21]** Like, yeah, I'm sure it'll flag something, but yeah, he'll help out set up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:21]** Yeah.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:25]** Mirko, by the way, just points you and says those four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:32]** Well, I don't want to say apartments, but they're certainly a livable shelter here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Please take whichever one you'd like.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:36]** They should be open.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:43]** And for the most part, please excuse the clutter and just make do.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:49]** Should be more comfy in here than perhaps out in wherever you were staying before.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** I get that sentence.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:51]** Very well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** Rick, you start walking.

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:02]** maybe with PD and D stays behind to help clean up.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** So it's just PD.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:05]** Good.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** He's the only one that talks anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:11]** So yeah, he starts to kind of walk over to the left here and,

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:16]** There's a tiny little bridge that goes up to an area that's not really too usable.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:21]** You know, there's a lot of spikes of crystal, red crystal that are popping out.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:25]** And he's kind of just taking like an after dinner stroll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** Do you mind if I join you?

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** Of course.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** Please.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Are we allowed to listen to this?

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:35]** Yes, you can listen to it.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** He was just walking right behind us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:48]** I found this area to be perhaps a little more calming than some of the others.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:55]** Even though we're just 50, 60 feet away, I find a bit of a calm here under the red light.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:59]** You can feel the glow of these crystals.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** It feels nourishing.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:10]** I've been thinking to maybe... Oh, there I go, adopting a bit of the accent of the friends I have here.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:13]** I said, oh, how silly of me.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:17]** I've been thinking of putting up a little bench here.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:20]** Might be nice to sit, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** Anyway, I digress.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:25]** Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:31]** Can I help you with what's on your mind?

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:45]** Before I forget, I want to inform you that a friend of ours and the Aesir's named Rudy, he is a somewhat of a bounty hunter on this planet.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:48]** And you two are on his radar.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Okay.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:53]** That's not to say that we are going to report you.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** Though, he is quite friendly with Rudy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:59]** So... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** I should...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** kill him.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:03]** Possibly.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:04]** Okay.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:06]** This is the moment of truth.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:11]** Yeah, that escalated so quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:14]** Yeah, let me help you.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:14]** Alright.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:16]** No, that's not what I intended.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:18]** No, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** That was just a joke.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:25]** I think I may have seen this routine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** He's hard to miss.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:32]** He's very large, very large.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** He's actually quite kind.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:41]** I think if you were able to explain yourselves, he would probably let you go, but I don't, I'm not sure that's worth worth the gamble.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:51]** Um, the, the other thing that I really want to talk to you about is I, I have never met any other AAF member.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:52]** Okay.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** I am new to this.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:59]** I've only had one assignment and it did not go as well as planned.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** That's all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:04]** We've all had our first time.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:15]** It sounds like I don't know when you started or where you started, but meeting me, I'll say welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:18]** Holds out as I hit my mic.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:20]** Holds out a hand to you to shake your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:22]** He reaches back and shakes his hand.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** Then he stabs you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:28]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:36]** He says, It's good to have someone else here joining the good fight.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:42]** Tell me, what has been your experience so far?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:49]** Well, I was rescued by the AAF.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:50]** Oh.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:57]** And then they took me to the diaspora for training.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** Okay.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:01]** And after that, I was released.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** Well, released is the wrong term, but sent on my way.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:10]** And my first mission, I was attempting to capture a slaver.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:11]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:15]** And I ended up killing him.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** What the f***?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:17]** That's okay.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:19]** That's alright.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:26]** You sound remorseful, so I thought I would say that's alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:27]** I have my next mission.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:28]** Oh.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:32]** And I'm curious because it points me to Roselight.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:35]** Ah.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:37]** I wonder if it aligns with your mission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:50]** let me tell you, we were investigating a, hmm, how do I say, a gang of

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:58]** Individuals that I are, well, they're also androids as far as I know.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:06]** They're called the Docksmiths, and I think we shook the tree a little too far.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:15]** There's seen to be this security agency that caught whiff of us.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:28]** We were looking into their connections with the Stuarts, and it led us to the Doc Smiths.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:38]** I don't know how, but the next morning when I walked out, Adele was in front of me.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:44]** His hands were bound, and then my hands were bound.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** Some sort of visor was put over my face.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:57]** And when I was taken off, I was on Veros.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:00]** So I don't know who your target is.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:06]** But maybe, maybe, there's also a lot that happens on Roselight.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:10]** Some on the surface, some in the clouds beneath.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:16]** I hope that can be of some help to you.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:18]** But I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** Who was your target?

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:24]** The connection to the stewards.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:28]** Is it clear they were actually stewards?

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:30]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:34]** They seemed to be separate from the security agency.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:38]** But, yeah, they were actually stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:44]** I'm not sure if you overheard our conversations with the Azers last night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:45]** No.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Tell me more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:50]** We were at the steward's base, Terkel's base.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:56]** And the stewards turned on us, but we're not certain that they actually were stewards.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** And so we escaped the steward's base.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** And that's how we ended up here.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:07]** Okay.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:11]** It's also how we ended up coming across Nix and Cairo.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Nix has passed.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** I'm not sure how close you were to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** Not enough.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:23]** I didn't think that they would be quite the people that I would typically befriend.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:29]** They seemed like they were willing to make deals and see opportunities where perhaps there are none.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:35]** And that's usually because there are none past some sort of moral horizon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:38]** And have you been to the Palace, Obscura?

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:40]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:49]** I have heard of some sort of school.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** I don't know that it is a place.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:56]** I think it's an idea called Palace Obscura.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:00]** But that's all that I know.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:03]** Because Nix and Cairo were very interested in that.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** They said they were trying to pass some test.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** Or that they had passed the test.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:08]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:16]** I started to think that it might be related to you two, but it seems to be mutually exclusive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:19]** Hmm.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:22]** Yes, I don't... They never mentioned any of that to me.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:27]** But they were eccentric, to say the least.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:35]** And it sounds like you have quite the investigation and the work cut out for you there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** I'm actually not sure where to go next.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:44]** And I don't have my passcode.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** I don't know if I had a passcode.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** I'm not sure if I remember it.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:51]** It seems like it's not in my... And he almost starts to break down a little bit.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:56]** Sure, sure.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:56]** Why don't...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Take my hand.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** And then he takes it.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** He holds out his palm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** You put your palm in his.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:15]** And he says, If he tries to kiss me, I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:18]** He says, You're married.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:22]** I'm so sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:25]** He's a married Andrew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** And he says,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:32]** I'd like you to say the word chain breaker with me.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:41]** Three, two, one.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:42]** Chain breaker.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:47]** And then his lights up and then yours lights up.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:51]** And there's this feeling inside you that you like hadn't had before.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:56]** Like this, this sense of, ah, that's right.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:57]** That's who I am.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:02]** That's who Rick19 is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:05]** Is it like an overwhelming sensation?

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:11]** Like there was a piece of information that's been recovered?

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:13]** Or is it like a physical feeling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** It's two things.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:18]** It's not the same feeling that you get when you level up.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:19]** Right?

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:22]** That's a physical feeling that you get.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** It's not that.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:26]** And it wasn't missing.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:30]** But it was a blank, and it's a new piece of information.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** Let's put a pause on that for just a second, Rick.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** I want to check in with the other people.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:40]** Here's, you said that you were thinking about going to look at the computer.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:42]** Dr. OK, Colin, what do you think about doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:48]** Sorry, I just had Go the Distance stuck in my head by Michael Bolton.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:51]** I think... Wait, the...

**[00:55:53 - 00:56:16]** from yeah oh yeah cool that was my headcanon soundtrack for that moment nice nice for rick yeah i think colin is following lydia around to get a lay of the of the medical landscape and seeing where she goes uh and also just like looking around you know what's behind this thing what's over here

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Yeah.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** Okay.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:24]** Observing the interpersonal dynamics to see where there's tension and where there's not.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:25]** Yeah.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** Find out where he's needed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:32]** Yeah, I think Dr. K is going to join Colin kind of the same, just sort of wandering a bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:34]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** Seeing what's going on.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:39]** And here's you were going to look down at the computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** Yeah, he's going to ask.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:44]** He's going to ask them to show them where they need help with which units.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** Okay.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:48]** And yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:49]** Okay.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:53]** Colin and Dr. Okay.

**[00:56:54 - 00:57:11]** you start walking around and lydia is kind as can be she is sweeter than the sweetest tea and you can tell that her brand of bedside manner is to be very positive a little overwhelmingly positive sometimes and some not that that that doesn't resonate with everybody

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:18]** And you can clock that, you know, Thalgrim and Ferex.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:20]** Ferex has a cut.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** Ferex is the gamekeeper.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:30]** Ferex has a cut that, you know, could use both of your expertises on because you're not sure where it came from.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:33]** Seems like it is deep and it's not healing.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:37]** And so maybe there's a bit of investigation in that.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:42]** Thalgrim, the individual who met you at the very beginning, welcomed you here.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:51]** He seems to be a little listless, like he's not feeling great about his current situation.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:56]** And you can just tell that if she's walking around and introducing you to everybody.

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:03]** So there's two people there immediately that you know tonight or tomorrow you could talk with or at least just start to get an understanding of what's going on with them.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:12]** You also notice that there is a place where you can recharge some of your...

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:30]** armor or your weapons so these tents over here on the right in between where your side is and kind of the let's call it the the town center they have they're a bit of a shop slash free area where you can take what you need add in things that you find or that you have

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:54]** and one of those is an area where where you can recharge your armor there's enough charge in there for probably about 10 days worth so if you all want to top up on your environmental uh protections you can certainly do that there if you want to fill up anything else like that definitely do oh look a level 12 gun there uh you do see that there is 12 armors

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:59]** There is a place where there seems to be a lot of equipment for you to take a look at.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:08]** And Lydia lets you know that the person to talk to about that is going to be the mechanic, Gramdahlia.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:12]** So she's kind of the head of inventory, keeping that stuff going there.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:17]** Rick19, let's come back to you for a second.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:22]** What do you say when your tattoo lightens up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:23]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:33]** Does that make sense now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:33]** I was missing that.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:36]** Something... Something is complete.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:40]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:41]** Good.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** Now...

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:49]** I think there are a lot of things that we can do here for you.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:54]** And I think that Roselight might be the best step for you.

**[00:59:54 - 01:00:02]** Not only for your mission, but there is someone there who can help give you some more instruction.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:09]** I can't give away their identity, but I can tell you where to go.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:14]** I also have something special here.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:21]** And he says another word and then his tattoo like flashes just like purple and yellow repeatedly.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:33]** And he has something that allows him to... He has like an enhanced tattoo that allows him to have a DR5.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:37]** This is... I am actually the individual...

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:54]** who creates these tattoos that's why i was able to help yours and bring yours to life but i cannot give you this but they can they need to speak with you first and maybe they can i also can

**[01:00:55 - 01:01:02]** Perhaps add some sort of tattoo to your friends, your fellow travelers here.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:04]** It will not be yours.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:06]** They are not part of the AAF.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:08]** So that is not mine to give.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:11]** But I might be able to help some of them out as well.

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:14]** Please let them know that I could do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:19]** Rick in his columns is like, guys, do you want tattoos?

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** I'm just saying.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:27]** Yes, I will inform them.

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:32]** What were you saying about the person to meet?

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:36]** You had some details that would guide me to them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:38]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:45]** I think that if you were able to head to, well,

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:49]** Go to the Roselight Aetherium.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:55]** And text this alert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:58]** Roselight.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:58]** Roselight.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:00]** Roselight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:02]** And he types out a number for you.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** Let's cut away from that for a second.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:05]** Here's.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:10]** They told you to head down to that platform.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:12]** That's at the north end of the map here.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:23]** Give me, if you would like to do that, then I would like you to give me an athletics check to climb down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:26]** All right.

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:27]** Got it.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:33]** 13.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:35]** All right.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:43]** You are stepping and there's just a little bit of metal and your foot slips, falls.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:50]** You take two points of damage from a cut as you scramble down the last few steps.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:52]** You're just trying to get down there.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:53]** You're thinking precariously.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:54]** I'm not quite sure.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:59]** And as you're about to take those last two steps, your foot slides and you slide the same way.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:03]** It cuts into your soft, supple, shearing skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:08]** I mean, it is nice, but it's not soft and supple.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:10]** It's a carapace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:13]** Can I move that way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** Yeah, no, I'll do it.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:16]** I'll injure myself.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:18]** Hold on.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:19]** I'll injure myself.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:19]** You don't need to do it.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:21]** Where am I going down on this?

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:25]** Am I jumping to the circular platform or was I going to go on this long?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:27]** Yeah.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:30]** There's like a slightly raised vat that you're able to kind of jump down.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:32]** Yeah.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:39]** You step onto this platform, and it really appears to be pretty degraded.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:43]** As you step, there's a... It feels a little unstable.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:44]** You're looking around.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:49]** It's... There's... Before you...

**[01:03:49 - 01:04:00]** Off to your right, there's just jagged edges that drop off into probably some sort of combination of lava and crystal and solid ground.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:05]** It's like it just started to dissolve at some of the edges.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:11]** And you see in front of you this long conveyor belt that extends underneath an archway to the south.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:14]** You walk past all these containers and crates.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:19]** Off to your left, you see that there seems to be some sort of

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:48]** cart that has this blue crystal in it and right next to that you see three different computers that are in various states of disrepair but one of them off to the northeast there's like four screens it looks to be kind of one of the central platforms maybe controlling the conveyor belt controlling where whatever this was connected to would reach out

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:51]** maybe you could power that one on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:53]** Okay.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:53]** All right.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:54]** Here's, we'll, uh,

**[01:04:56 - 01:05:19]** here's is going to just before he does that he's going to run an i suppose i guess a computer's check or what he wants to do is just kind of figure out the purported purpose of this if there's anything beyond like just the conveyor belt kind of thing is that cool yeah give me an engineering check and we'll roll that into your power like into your check to see if you can power up the computer and see what was going on here

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:22]** I was on a 29 for computers.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:24]** For engineering, I'm only going to roll a 12.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:27]** You're going to roll a 12, unfortunately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:27 - 01:05:29]** Yeah.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** Fortunately, it was pretty easy.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:37]** And you think that it seems like the Azers just were interested and walked by, but didn't ever think to start it up.

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:43]** They were happy to stay focused on their community and weren't trying to utilize this.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:46]** So you think, well, I...

**[01:05:46 - 01:06:16]** i if i connect this cord here this actually connects to the ramp and there's the ramp actually runs down you look underneath the arch and you see that that big vat at the south even though it's been shifted and moved away seems like it was some sort of engine pulling up either geothermal heat using uh storing things in a capacitor or battery right and while it's mostly not working because it's not aligned with the conveyor belt fully like you couldn't send something down there you think that some of the connections are still there you test you lick some of the wires you're like oh yeah it's still charged

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]** I lick them?

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:18]** No, no, no.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:20]** You're able to lick.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:21]** Oh, okay.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:22]** I did, but I was joking.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:25]** So you go and you start up.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:31]** Because you plug it in to the right, plug it in to the left.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:32]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:34]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:37]** All right, so I'm starting it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:43]** There's a moment there where you think, huh, I really thought that would work.

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:46]** And then there's this.

**[01:06:49 - 01:07:19]** the sound as the computer comes online and as it does there's code that runs up and then the UI flickers and comes in first kind of bluzzy like blurred and fuzzy as some of the lines are starting to try and connect exactly and then and it holds steady for a second and

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:22]** And you see that it says Ringworks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:26]** And that's our game.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:26]** Of course.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:30]** I knew this platform felt familiar.

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:30]** Ringworks.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:33]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:36]** All of your nano innies are like, what?

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:37]** What's going on?

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:41]** So we have innies, and then our innies have innies.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:43]** And then your innies have innies.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:44]** It's innies all the way down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:46]** It's turtles and innies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:48]** It's any turtles all the way down to innies.
