## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:14]** Hello friends.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:21]** Welcome to my channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:26]** All right, we're back again for another week.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:36]** I am your hot hatch GM, John Swan.

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:40]** What kind of hot hatch are you driving?

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:43]** I said that and I didn't know quite what it meant.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:46]** You would like small VWs.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** I would.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:47]** Venues.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** You're a good GTI guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:52]** Your SX4 could be loosely considered a hot hatch.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** The way we drove it, it was certainly hot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** It was certainly hot.

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:02]** It was driven so much that when I went in to trade it in, I hope that they didn't notice that the engine was starting to knock.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** And they didn't.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:08]** And they were like, all right, well, here at CarMax, do you want to take your car home before you come back and pick up your new?

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** And I was like, nope, I'm good.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:10]** You know what?

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:11]** Enjoy it.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Have fun.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** Take it out for a test drive.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:15]** And I never saw it again.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:21]** With that, quick question, quick banter, because I really want to get into it, because there's a lot of cool stuff.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:25]** You all had a great episode last time, and I really want to see what happens next.

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:29]** But I do have a quick question, because I heard this, and I'm like, I need to know.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:32]** What was the first R-rated movie that you watched?

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:55]** cliffhanger cliffhanger yeah sir you should have told us that in episode 130 that was yeah dude what are you doing yeah yeah yeah uh mine was desperado i think it was like five uh with my granddad desperado yeah is that with antonio banderas i don't know i was five

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** It is Antonio Banderas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** All I knew was it wasn't a cartoon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:06]** I never watched it again.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:12]** Was that the one where he has the guitar and there's not actually a guitar in the guitar case?

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** It's actually like a bunch of guns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Freaking bad.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** I think mine was Terminator 2.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:20]** Terminator 2 is a good one.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:21]** Was that rated R?

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** I think mine also was.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** Yeah, it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:23]** That was PG-13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:30]** It was rated R. I mean, that's pretty scary with... What's the actor's name who plays the liquid guy?

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** Arnold Schwarzenegger?

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:31]** No.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** No.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:32]** Robert Patrick.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** Robert Patrick.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:35]** Yeah.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:37]** He was scary.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** As a cop?

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** He was pretty intense.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:45]** Yeah, there were some really good references to that movie in that new horror...

**[00:03:46 - 00:04:15]** uh i guess it's more of a thriller it's the one where they're like companion the companion i need to see that yeah is it worth the watch absolutely okay cool so amc i'm going to try to talk fast amc does something called uh scream unseen on on like once a month and so for five bucks you show up to the movie theater and you watch a movie you have no idea what it is you don't know what it's about all you know is the runtime and the rating and so uh listen i did it once and it was literally the worst movie we've ever seen and probably will ever see

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:17]** did it again because we're masochists.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** Wait, what was the first movie?

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:20]** I would have to look it up.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Into the Darkness.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** Yeah, it's bad.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Yes, it was that bad.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:28]** And this one was The Companion, which we were planning to go see anyway.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:31]** So like, yeah, very good movie.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:31]** Recommend it.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:35]** Don't want to say anything else about it because I will spoil it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:49]** don't spoil it well and the companion the the actress is the same actress as um that plays one of the younger girls in yellow jackets and i think yeah that's right yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** I think mine, first R-rated movie.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:54]** Oh, that was cool.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:59]** Sorry, I just, I literally saw that and I was like, where's chain cuts on Siren Escape?

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]** I don't know, I was just playing.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:07]** It does sound like a car, but it also sounds like you're being chased by a chainsaw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:10]** I thought you were setting up Texas Chainsaw Massacre.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:32]** oh dude that would be awesome that would be so good no that was not it that would i would do my pants if i saw that um no i think the first one that i saw pretty sure was gladiator because i remember going with oh it is rated r but it's like 12 years old yeah i was like 10 or 11 or something and i went with my dad legendary

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** Are you five?

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** Yeah, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:40]** I saw Cliffhanger when I was like six years old.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** Is that scary?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** I think mine was Predator.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** It's not that scary.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:46]** It actually might have been Predator for me too.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** That's probably what it was.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** I've never seen that.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:52]** It's hard to say.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:56]** Not to be like, okay.

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:00]** So like when you watch like regular cable, you know how there's like those like fuzzy things.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** It's fuzzy, right?

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:04]** I don't know if it still is this way, but there's like those channels that you don't have.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:10]** So like, but if you like, like there are obviously pay-per-view channels there that have like porn like things.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:15]** So when I was like a kid, like what I would do was I would like, you would press, I figured this out.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:20]** If you go up and down rapidly on the channels, it actually will show the image.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:43]** like so then like so if you ever want to watch some like on those just go like that the entire time and like little kelly was very excited when uh i mean i used to do that too but there was you used to if you every once in a while it'd just be free it would just be on oh and so like princess mononoke was one of the ones

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:47]** That's a good movie.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:52]** One time Playboy Channel was on and I threw a VHS tape in there and hit record.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:56 - 00:07:00]** What movie did you... Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:02]** What was the plot of that cinema, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** Six hours worth of Playboy Channel.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** It was great.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** Things that are real hot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:12]** You all descended...

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:15]** I've got the vapors.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:15]** The vapors.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:27]** You all descended into the mine after last time, surviving the intense cliff, thankfully, making your way across the planet.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** You're much closer to Terrapin now.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:30]** You're like 200 miles closer.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:35]** And you made your way over to a crater.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:36]** Old crater.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** Found a pit.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:42]** Descend.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:43]** Of despair.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** You see this door with this hand wheel.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:54]** You guys realize that something happened here, like something like cataclysmic happened here.

**[00:07:55 - 00:08:01]** And all the buildings, what used to be there, half of it was sunk away and some of it's still left, but it's been eroded very quickly.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:07]** You find this door and you took a long time to figure out what to do with that door.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:07]** And I get it.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:08]** You don't know.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:12]** Until you realize Dr. K's quick thinking.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:14]** Science.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** I think you might need to.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** Science.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** Let me heat it up.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** Science.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** Yeah.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** Because it works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:28]** You open the door with Chad, your new steel beam friend.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** And there's a really cool set of stairs going down.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:38]** And you all head down slowly but surely.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:42]** Step by step by step.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** Feels even hotter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:49]** Absorbing all the riz there is from those stairs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:49]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** Those super cool stairs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:55 - 00:09:01]** And as you get to the end, you walk for honestly maybe 20 minutes, 25, 30 minutes.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:05]** And as you get to the end, you feel yourself listing to the right.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:07]** The hall is pulling you to the right.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:13]** And then at the end, you see that right around the corner is a red light.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** Let's stay in the theater of the mind for a second.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:24]** I believe the order was Rick, Colin, Hears, and Dr. Okay.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:25]** What do you do?

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** You're about to walk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:28]** Say a red light or like a red glow?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** Sorry, like a red glow.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:36]** There's like a red glow coming from whatever is beyond that turn on the right.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:43]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:47]** What's the, what's the, the light level around us?

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:51]** Like, can we see the other walls or did we just see this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:53]** No, but you can just see it ahead.

**[00:09:53 - 00:10:01]** Like now that you can see it, the, you know, it's like the, the streaks of red are starting to play on the walls and cast these shadows.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:06]** I mean, you're in the mantle or the crust of Veros.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** Are there other shadows moving?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:09]** No.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** What does this hallway smell like?

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** Good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:21]** Smells like... Perfume?

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** Roxanne!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** Roxanne!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** I don't think ScienceScape would allow us to have that drop.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** Thank you, ScienceScape, for being awesome partners.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** You're great.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** Thanks for being our partner.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:32]** Thank you.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** Thanks for being our partner.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** Thanks for being our partner.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** Well, that's the creepiest thing ever.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:40]** Thanks for being our partner.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** Thanks for being our partner.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** It's going to be like no more partnership.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:42]** Yeah.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:45]** Like two episodes in there like, hey, so we listen to this app.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** We're like, no.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** Yeah, about that.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:48]** Please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** It's not really our vibe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** Please don't mention this anymore.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** Yeah, yeah, stop.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** Just don't even use it actually.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** Just totally.

**[00:10:56 - 00:11:04]** It smells like, it smells like, it's certainly a smell you've never experienced in your nostrils.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** Very novel.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:12]** And it smells like the blend of raw... 11 herbs and spices.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** Yeah.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** 26 herbs and spices.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:26]** It smells like the blend of raw, molten material blended with cool air.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:29]** Okay.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:34]** And then there's also this other scent that you're like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** You know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:40]** Smells faintly of like... Four of you know it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** Balrog.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:41]** Rotting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:45]** But you can't... All four of us know it?

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:46]** Yeah.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Does it smell like rotten eggs?

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:48]** No.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:50]** There's some smell.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** It's a little good.

**[00:11:51 - 00:12:00]** There's like this like... You're like... Why haven't I... How do I know that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:02]** Pass it.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:04]** What do you do?

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Is this some kind of magic?

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** You want to detect magic?

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:09]** Sure.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** Rick doesn't have that ability.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Yes.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** Why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** Okay.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:13]** Yes.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:18]** Actually, this is what detect magic sounds like.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:24]** That's what it sounds like.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** You don't detect anything.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** What's the range on that?

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** It's like 30 feet, right?

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** 60.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:32]** 60.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:33]** Yeah.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:35]** You don't detect anything in particular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:40]** Rick picks up a rock.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:42]** I'm assuming there's loose rocks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** Yeah, there's loose rocks.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** So Rick is going to pick up a rock.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:52]** And as you do that, you start to hear the sound of like ding, ding.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:58]** Sounds very like reverberant.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:02]** Like whatever is next is huge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:05]** It is the ball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** What do you do with that rock?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** He chucks it down the hallway.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:11]** You put it in your pocket and apologize.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** What?

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:13]** You throw it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** Yeah, we're so sorry.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** You go to throw it.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** You actually hit Colin in the back.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** You throw it.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** Rick grabs his arm.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** No, no, no.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:21]** Don't throw it.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** Don't throw it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** You shall not.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** So you do that, and the tinging stops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:31]** Oh, my God.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** Mistakes were made.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** It's like that.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:46]** I'm just picturing, like, you know, in the Lord of the Rings when he knocks the bucket over into the well when they're in.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** You fool.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:49]** Did you just pull a Mary?

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** Yeah.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:56]** What if you drop, like, a speaker and it's playing, like, Kendrick or something?

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** JBL speaker thing?

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Yeah.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:58]** What?

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** Mustard on the beat, yo.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** Mustard!

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:05]** Anyway, so, what do you do?

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** Enough horses around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:10]** What do you do, Kev?

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** I'm gonna attempt to sneak forward.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** Now you're gonna attempt to sneak?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** After I turn around.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** So, Kev's like, stay here.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:51]** alright that's a nine total oh my god you peek around and it continues a little bit but you think you see what looks like like a plateau of rock and then you start to see where it drops off and the red before you becomes even more iridescent and changing and shifting the closer that you get to it do you peek your head around or are you just trying to get as close as you can


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:55]** So I'm like at an edge and there's definitely a sharper turn.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:58]** There's an opening before you that if you want to look.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:04]** I am going to do a perception check at this point.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** For a total of 15.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** 15.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** And I'd also like to do survival.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:13]** Okay.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** To look for footprints.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:15]** Okay.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** For a 22.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** 22.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:21]** 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:48]** survival no footprints i mean like nothing out of the ordinary that you can see here there's no like not just footprints survival is all whatever any kind of was there scrapes along the wall i know i know okay no sure no there's nothing with 15 you think you hear voices

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:58]** And then you think you hear a slightly louder voice.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:01]** And then you hear some activity.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:03]** Like activity stopped.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** And then it's picking up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:08]** Yeah, that's not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:08]** Getting closer.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** Not getting closer.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:12]** You heard it stop.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:12]** And then you waited.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:16]** And then it picks back up.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** There's a din, let's call it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** The dwarves, they tug too deep.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:27]** Yeah, Rick whispers into, I mean, because he's, you know, we're in our helmet stuff.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:32]** There's people up there, at least two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** Well, what do we expect to find?

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:37]** I'm not sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Reptoids?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:41]** Should we go check them out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:41]** Can we proceed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:47]** Are we just going to knock, throw a rock and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:49 - 00:17:18]** bounce out why don't you use I could throw another rock your famed negotiation skills maybe not how about how about no to the throwing of rocks we don't want to provoke them um Rick is going to put his gun over his back on and and as you do that you hear ding ding ding again

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** And he's going to step out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:27]** Is it just Rick?

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:27]** Just Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:30]** Okay.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** Yeah, just Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:34]** Rick, you step out.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:40]** Can I show just Rick the map?

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** Everybody close your eyes.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:48]** I don't know if I can bring just Rick to the map on Foundry.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** So let's play this out just for a second, Rick.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:54]** You step over, gun ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:58]** No, I put my gun away is what I said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:58]** Apologies.

**[00:17:59 - 00:17:59]** You put your gun away.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** And you walk out into...

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:12]** An enormous cavern, probably, I'd say, 60 to 80 feet high, maybe more.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:17]** If you look back among the stalactites, those are the ones that hang.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** If you look deep, some of them look long.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:22]** The light's just not reaching.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:30]** All around you, it's like you're on this cliff that heads forward and then branches off.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:49]** And you're maybe 15 feet above an uncertain ground of just rifts of lava and steam and vapor escaping, some noiselessly, some incredibly noisy.

**[00:18:51 - 00:19:00]** You look off to your right a little bit as you peek out, and you see that there's some machinery, new machinery,

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:05]** but it looks like it was some sort of drill or rotating device.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:15]** And you look ahead, straight ahead, you bring your gaze about, and you see probably one of the largest natural

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:40]** growths of red crystal that you've ever seen in your life and you can't quite see over to the edge but you think there's something down there and there's more man-made material you think you can just sort of see a little bit computer screens now that's below these little bluffs cliff

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:49]** On the cliff right in front of you is a collection of these makeshift homes.

**[00:19:51 - 00:20:00]** There's maybe, I don't know, 10 of them, 12 of them, three long tables in the center, a couple of tents off to the left and to the right.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:10]** And as you walk out, you see these stout creatures.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:20]** that maybe four feet in height, all of them thick, muscled, burly folk.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:26]** And their heads are on fire, literal fire.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:33]** And their bodies, their faces are stone.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:39]** Their skin is this like stone gray, some brown, some gray, some dark.

**[00:20:42 - 00:21:09]** when they look you can see that their eyes that where their pupils are is also fire where their mouth is is also fire and they're just walking around there aren't too many maybe six if you were talking so they're like fire dwarves please tell me the door give me a life science yeah give me a life science check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:16]** Rick is describing them audibly, so if anybody else wants to do a... What do I do?

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** Life science?

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:20]** Life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:23]** 19.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:23]** 19.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** 25.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:24]** 25.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:25]** By description.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** Dr. K rolled up 31.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:28]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** Dr. K casually rolls.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:36]** Dr. K, you think immediately, these are Azers.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:37]** They're what?

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:38]** Azers.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:38]** Azers.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:48]** Asers are dwarf-like creatures, Dr.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:50]** O.K., that come from the plane of fire.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:53]** They are extraplanar creatures.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:57]** You would know the plane of fire is where the city of Brass is.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:59]** That's the capital, I'm pretty sure.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:06]** Some of them live on some very fiery material plane worlds, like Varos, maybe.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** You don't know.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:10]** For them to be on Varos...

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:34]** is a little odd because varus is for the most part uninhabited you also remember that azers come from a very regimented society and maybe if i get a little meta and pathfinder times you know that would be certainly a more divisive second class kind of society now in

**[00:22:35 - 00:23:01]** starfinder you know that they are usually in the past they they have worked with ifriti and they've usually worked under ifriti and now maybe there's a better relationship there maybe not maybe things are tenuous so they're really interesting creatures sorry a really interesting species i'll say


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** Do we know if they're evil?

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:06]** They're not naturally evil, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:09]** No.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:12]** They're just like any other dwarf or any other race.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:14]** They're not naturally evil.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:16]** But they have very traditional values.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:20]** You can think of them in a very crude way as a fire dwarf.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:23]** But they really value communities.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:26]** They value communication.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:28]** They value support.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** And they have a very long history of

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:36]** supporting burning things of burning things down.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:36]** Yep.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** Burning bridges.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** So that's what you would know.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:39]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** Can't do that.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:45]** Rick19, you see where that ping-ping was coming from.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:57]** There's a particularly stout one with a fire beard that's very long, standing on a small stepstool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:59]** Maybe these guys could make us some weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:04]** They are repairing something on their house.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:04]** A shop!

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** A shop!

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** Our first shop!

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** Yes!

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** What do you do, Rick19?

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:14]** So far, they haven't seen you yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:20]** We should introduce ourselves in the most cordial way possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:26]** Like, he agrees and then just like shouts, greetings!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:30]** Amazing.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** You shout greetings.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** Do the other three of you just walk out?

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** What do you do?

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** Yeah, why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** Yeah, you walk out.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** Talon gives a friendly wave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:43]** I'm going to bring you guys to the map.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:49]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:51]** You all are in the bottom left corner.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:54]** I'll pause the game just so you can take a look around.

**[00:24:56 - 00:25:04]** You can see here, like I said, there's this long cliffs and island in the middle with these little settlement there.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:08]** And off to the west, southeast, and the north.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** There's all this man-made material, possibly from a mine.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:17]** And again, the largest outcropping growth of red crystals that you think you've ever seen.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:19]** Mid-natural crystal growth ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:24]** Do we know if there's anything special about these crystals besides being just a red crystal?

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** You don't know.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** Not yet.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:29]** Can we do a roll to find out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:29]** You could.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:34]** I will tell you that without getting closer, it's probably not too much.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** You don't recognize it.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** Okay.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** So I shout greetings.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:40]** Do they turn?

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:42]** You shout greetings.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:45]** And the one swinging the hammer stops.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:49]** Kind of slowly looks over at you.

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:52]** There's a little smile on their face.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** They step down.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:59]** Walk over to you very solidly.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:00]** They stop.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** Still holding the hammer.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** One hand waves.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:15]** Says, Well, and who do we have here walking through our door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** Oh, just some weary travelers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** Weary travelers.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:26]** And are you a friend or foe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:34]** Our friend, Rudy, he thought we, I think he was trying to point us to you guys to come say hello.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:39]** He said, you're really cool and we're really cool.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:41]** And so we'd get along as friends is what he said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** Yeah, we helped him catch a bounty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** Rudy.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** You know Rudy, right?

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** The most interesting guy around.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** You know Rudy?

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** Are we at the right place?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** You know him.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:56]** Rudy's quite the traitor.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** There's a thoughtfulness with every word.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:04]** And you see the hammer relax a little bit in his hand.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:09]** And he says, I'm Thelgrim Emberhard.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** Welcome.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Come with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:16]** Turns and starts to walk forward.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:19]** Felgrim Ingr... What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:22]** Felgrim Emberheart.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** Emberheart.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:27]** Emberheart.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** I'll put it in the chat for you.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:31]** I got that right the first try, I'm sure.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** You always do.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** He starts walking forward.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Hey, everybody.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** We've got some new friends.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:51]** He starts to walk forward and you see maybe, like I said, six other of these creatures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** Let me show you.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:56]** Sorry, one of them is four times the size of the others?

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:56]** Hang on.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:57]** Is that the one?

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** Hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** Yeah, I'm seeing that too.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:00]** Don't worry.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** He looks scary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:05]** I'm showing you guys what Thelgrim Emberheart looks like.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:08]** He looks like a Greek god or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:08]** He's cool.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:12]** They look like from Ocarina of Time or Ocarina of Time.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** The Goron?

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:16]** The stone creatures?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:16]** The Gorons, yeah.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** But with fire ears.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:19]** That's exactly what I was thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:22]** Fire on their elbows, massive feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:31]** The big one kind of looks like Carlac from BG3 a little bit.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:33]** Like a female bullrog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:38]** They have this brassy, futuristic armor on.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:45]** One of them appears to be wearing kind of a bib, an apron.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:52]** Another one has kind of cargo pants with a lot of tools and a tool belt set up.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** So they're all doing these different roles.

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:00]** And then Thalgrim walks forward and says, They say that they're friends of Rudy.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:06]** That old... He's just the best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:10]** And then... They made the right or wrong choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** Oh, God.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:13]** A few of them walk up.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** and start to walk forward.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:19]** And then the large creature walks forward.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:22]** And you would know this to be an Ifriti.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:26]** Let me show you guys the art.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** Ifriti?

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:28]** Oh, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:31]** Yeah.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** She has, like... She looks like Karlak.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** Yeah, she's Karlak-ish.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:37]** Also head on fire with this flame.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:40]** Antlers.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** Yeah, but these, like, four antlers.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** Who's Karlak?

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** Sorry.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Play some Baldur's Gate 3 with a new computer.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** Oh, okay.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** Yeah.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** And this cool armor.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:52]** And she strides over, confident, and a smile.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:56]** Well, if you're friends of Rudy's,

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** and you're friends of ours.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:03]** She's this large creature, seven and a half feet tall, giant steps.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:08]** I'm Mirko Pyrexilian.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** And what are your names?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:14]** My name's Dr. Gontu Okada.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** Yeah, Gontu.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** Pleasure to meet you.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:19]** Did you get that, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:20]** I got Mirgo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** Mirgo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** Here's C. Fabricius.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** Nice to meet you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** What does the C stand for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:34]** He holds out a hand with hesitation because he doesn't know if he'll light on fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:37]** She reaches out and shakes your hand.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:38]** It doesn't light on fire.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:40]** It feels very warm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:40]** Oh, thank God.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:42]** Oh, all right.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:44]** All right.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:46]** Well, it's in honor of my friend.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** He's no longer with us.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** It's Chad.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** I took his middle name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** That's very noble of you.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:51]** Nice to meet you.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** Very noble.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:56]** Thank you.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:58]** And you, Mr. Landroid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:58 - 00:30:59]** My name is Rick19.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** And he reaches out and shakes your hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Pleasure.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:04]** And you?

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** Lester Cullen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:09]** Hi, I'm Cullen Eden Brand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:15]** You all can take off your environmental protections if you'd like.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:22]** It's quite a pleasant atmosphere in here, thanks to those points of the crystals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:26]** What fascinating crystals those are.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:31]** What pray tell are they that makes this atmosphere so amenable?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** They are quite good.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** We'll get into it there, Doctor.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Okay, Doctor.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:43]** Please, may I ask, why have you come?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:52]** We were on our way to the station to try and get off this rock after...

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:56]** A bit of an accident at one of the other stations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:59]** Do you happen to know Tirkala Space?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Tirkala Space.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:04]** I, I've heard of it.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** Yeah.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** Yeah.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** Don't know much about it.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:10]** We don't travel up to the surface very often.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:17]** And then we, we came across Rudy up on his lava strider.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:24]** We helped him track down some escapees from the prison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:31]** You know, it is quite the effort to get Rudy in here.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:35]** It's not a large tunnel, but it's quite the effort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** He just does quite a good impression of Sherry.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:39]** He should ask him to do it later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** It's funny that you see that.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** Lydia Searstone.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:45]** Over there.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:51]** Points to a Acer that I'll show you the image of.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** Who looks very angry.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** She looks delightful.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:57]** But her whole arm is molten.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** But she doesn't have that angry face.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** She has a smiley face.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:05]** Lydia loves learning about lava striders.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:07]** So maybe you should tell her that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** So I...

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** Sure, I'll be sure to teach her later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:15]** Is my understanding... That's great.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:20]** Is my understanding that you all need some rest and respite?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:23]** Yeah, wouldn't be bad.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** Great.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Why not?

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** I'm curious what you guys are doing down here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:32]** Oh, well, we're trying to survive.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** Honestly, it has been a tumultuous journey.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:39]** But we can get into that here.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:43]** Let me go ahead and explain to you a little bit about what we have here.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:48]** Welcome, I forgot to say, welcome to Corundum.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:52]** This is the little settlement of Corundum.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:58]** We are refugees, I'll say, from the plane of fire.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:05]** I have no problem sharing about it, but I want to keep the focus on you for right now.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** I want you to be okay.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:15]** So... So close.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:19]** Look, we have possibly a couple of

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:49]** settlements sorry houses shelter over there points off to the east you can see along the ridge of the crystals you can see there are four homes that are off on the edge of the settlement facing kind of the crystals well you think you'd really enjoy staying there it's got a nice little view and we haven't used them at all lately um we've had no one else here conveniently four okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** Yeah, I wouldn't mind that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:55]** Wow, that's very, very serendipitous.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:57]** A few people walk up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:03]** I'm not quite ready to take a rest, but... No, no, of course not, no.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** A few other people walk up.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** They introduce themselves.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:09]** There's the mechanic, Grom Dahlia.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:12]** There's Steven Pyrelight.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:16]** who is the groundskeeper-ish.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** Nice to meet you.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:19]** And there's Zyra at the chef.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** There's like a lawnmower down here or what?

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** It's funny that you ask that, Doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:30]** Are these crystals, they need maintenance, I suppose, as a groundskeeper?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:38]** No, we actually, so they are all previously employees of mine.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:43]** Me and my wife, Neva, we were actually in the city of Basque.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** The crystals are employees?

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:45]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:47]** No, I'm talking about the Azers, Doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:48]** Oh, I see.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:49]** Stay with it.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:51]** There you go.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:53]** I'm a bit slow sometimes, even for a doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** That's okay.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:58]** So, we've, like I said, we're refugees here.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** So, we came here rather quickly.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:05]** I can tell you a bit more, maybe over a meal, but...

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:34]** yeah so they all had previous professions here helping in and around the estate and well one does as one is meant to do so they've stayed helping out and of course we all had to learn new things but they have been able to help fashion we've all come together to create a nice little community over the past I'd say a few months here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:38]** So they once were in your employee, but now they're your equals?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:41]** They've always been my equals, to be clear.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:44]** They just happen to be my employees.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:50]** But now we'll... And we've always been a family, but now we are a community together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** That seems quite nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:53 - 00:37:02]** She sits down on one of the benches and, you know, she's still taller than you, but at least her upper torso is.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:04]** What...

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** What perhaps do you need here?

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** We have some food.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:13]** We might, you know, take a rest.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:19]** We might be able to give you some supplies and maybe tell you a bit about where we've been.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:24]** And we'd love to hear some about the outside world and where you've been.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:27]** It sounds like you're leaving Tyr Calus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:32]** Do you got anything that would help us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:34 - 00:38:04]** in this harsh environment any cool armor cool armor oh yeah armor would be nice I've heard stories that hazers are an industrious people so I'm just curious if you guys manufacture anything for what do you guys do for an economy when he said that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** Thalgrim was like, aye, we are.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:09]** You know, he's like, we are industrious people.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:13]** They're all tradesmen.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Pretty much.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** Mirko speaks back up.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:18]** We don't have much of an economy right now, I'd say.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** Again, we are refugees.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** We've just been here for the past two months.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:28]** So we're a little on the subsistence side, I'd say.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:33]** But we welcome any sort of injection into our economy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:38]** With that said, we are here to help.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:46]** It seems like you all might be a little, she like gives each of you kind of a once over, a little bit of a refugee yourself, perhaps.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:51]** So with that, yes, we're happy to help.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:55]** You might want to talk to Grumdahlia.

**[00:38:55 - 00:39:00]** And Grumdahlia, over here.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:04]** She kind of speaks up from the back right here.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:07]** She's the one I'll show you her art as well.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:14]** She has this like long mane of like hair and just has this cool armor on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:18]** She looks awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:26]** And she might be able to help with some of the... Those forearms are wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** She's got some wild forearms.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** She could be like female fitness.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** The forearms, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:39]** And then there's somebody who walks over, very quickly walks over and says, Hey, I'm Steven.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** Steven Parley.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:44]** I'm actually the grailings keeper and also the engineer.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:51]** And then starts to like, in like a, like kind of a not knowing way, starts to be like, can I see what you're working with there?

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:57]** And then like tries to reach kind of for your guns or for your pack and be like, oh, I might be able to help out with something.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:59]** We've got a lot of things that we're actually here from the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** Sorry.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:06]** Rick kind of hands him the artillery laser like, freely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:09]** He's like, this could definitely use some improvements.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:09]** He is.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Oh, yes.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** This could use some improvement, too.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** Check this out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** I'm sorry.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:17]** I'm really busy with this artillery laser.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:20]** I think that might be the only thing I can do for your entire duration.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:21]** I'm so sorry.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** That's fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:29]** No, that's totally cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** We should...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:35]** We should get to know you all and settle in here, I suppose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:40]** And as Stephen's talking, he's like, see, there's a lot here that's actually been from the mine.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** The mine gave us a lot.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** It's been thankful that we've been here.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:46]** It's been thankful that I had that cousin that came here.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:50]** And then Mirko's like, there are some connections.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** There's a reason why we came here.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** Stephen's right.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:56]** Stephen, maybe you want to give the artillery back.

**[00:40:56 - 00:41:03]** And you can tell Stephen's just younger and excited and really wants to help and contribute because you all are new.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:10]** If you don't mind me asking, and if it's not too forward, what happened two months ago to send you here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** Oh, that's a good question.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:16]** Mirko speaks back up.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:20]** Let me answer your question here before we get to it.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:22]** Let me know.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:26]** Please remind me because there's something else that I meant to tell you and it's slipping my brain.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:29]** So just tell me in just a minute, but I will tell you what happened.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** You may go back to work.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:36]** Our new friends and visitors will come and meet with you soon.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:41]** But please don't let this interrupt your day unless you want to stay and talk.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:45]** And she kind of sits down at the table and she invites you all to sit down at the table too.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:48]** Of course, she takes up like half of one side of the bench.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:53]** But there are these three long tables in the center that you see are kind of like a communal gathering place for them.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:56]** And they all start to walk back.

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:02]** Thalgrim starts and walks over and starts to work on the flashing again that's on the top of the roof.

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:04]** And Lydia walks back inside.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:08]** And they all start to walk away.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** Steven says, could I take this?

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** Looks at you, Rick.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:14]** Can I take this and see what we have?

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:15]** Yeah, that'd be excellent.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** Great.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** Walks away.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** Invites you all to come sit.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:35]** Gramdahlia walks away and Zyra, the chef, has already started to bring out several mugs and two huge pots of tea that they can just start pouring.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:37]** And she starts pouring.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:43]** Mirko pours you some tea and invites you all to sit down.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:47]** It's... Well, where do I begin?

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:54]** There's another azer who steps over and sits down with you.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** Oi!

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:56]** How are you?

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** Ferex.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:07]** He's the... I used to be a game warden, and there's not much game here now, but I'm still partially helping out.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** So he sits down at the table with you.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:18]** You asked, Mirko starts talking again, you asked what led me here, what led all of us here.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:25]** Well, it's not my favorite story, I'll tell you that.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:33]** How familiar are you with the politics of the city of Blas?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:41]** Fred, I haven't seen any recent developments on an infosphere in quite some time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:44]** Ray.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** Ray.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:47]** That's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:57]** I am aware of your rather strict and somewhat domineering matriarch, I think it is, of your generation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:58]** Am I correct?

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:58]** Yeah.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** The Grand Sultana.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** Yeah.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:03]** She's rather domineering.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** For sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** That's about all I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:13]** So, there's a long history here between my people.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** Can't point to yourself.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:19]** And my friends here, the acers.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:22]** Much of it is bloody.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** Not great at all.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:29]** And truly horrible in some cases.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:35]** I have... I have never...

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:40]** I have never supported that, and most people don't now.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:45]** But I'll say that some of that sentiment still runs a little deep.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:48]** So there's always work to be done.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:55]** But my wife and I, Neva, we've always looked beyond that.

**[00:44:55 - 00:45:01]** Of course, the Grand Sultana more or less shares that.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:05]** She also, regardless of Aesir, Ifriti,

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:37]** he's been hawkish towards the other outlying sovereign cities and a lot of politics came up I made it a point to speak out and maybe that was my mistake and neither did too and well we put not only our lives but also the lives of all of our friends here in danger when

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:46]** In the middle of the night, there was an advancement of forces coming into our estate.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:49]** We were more or less prepared.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:59]** But how prepared can you be when troops walk into your home?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** Sounds awful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** Horrible.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:04]** Horrible.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:09]** One thing turned into another, and then I was able to

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:15]** Start ferrying some of the good people here out.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:22]** We actually, well, as you heard Stephen say, we had a connection.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:25]** We thought something like this might happen.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:32]** So we had a connection, a way to leave the plane and come back.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:32]** Rudy?

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:33]** No.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:36]** Rudy's nice, but he's not like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** I wouldn't be surprised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** Same.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** I also wouldn't be either.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:44]** No, we had a connection.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** A magic one.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** A one-time use.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:56]** And it led us to a place that Stephen's cousin actually worked here at this mine.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** And...

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:04]** Well, we thought that when we came through, we'd see.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:06]** We'd see them.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** I'm getting ahead of myself.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:17]** As we were leaving, Naiva... Well, Naiva was injured.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:21]** And I was going to get her.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** And I'm big, right?

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:26]** I'm pretty large.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:27]** But...

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:32]** as I was trying to go back through to get her.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:46]** The wisdom of my friends here held me back and their strength and the portal closed before I could go save Neva.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** So I don't know.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:54]** I don't know what she is.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:54]** Dead?

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Gone?

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** Brainwashed by the Grand Sultana?

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** I don't know.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:02]** That's, we're working on that.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:06]** But first and foremost, we're trying to survive here.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:10]** So that's why I don't like doing that, obviously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:13]** That sounds very troubling.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:13]** I'm sorry.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:16]** I hope you are able to find your family again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:17]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Thank you.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** I hope so too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** I'm sorry to hear that.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:28]** Oh, there are two things that I was going to be telling you.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:31]** But before I get there, just a quick question.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:39]** So you're leaving Tercullus and you're on your way to go where?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:50]** Uh, we're trying to get off this, uh, planet back, back to our respective homes and yeah, got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:52]** We found ourselves quite the story to tell.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:56]** If you'd like to listen over a few drinks.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:56]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:57]** Yeah.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:58]** Oh, here.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** Well, what time is it?

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** She looks.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:03]** It's fine.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:10]** She starts to like kind of call out to Zyra to bring over something a little stronger than tea.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:15]** And some of the other Azers walk out.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:21]** kind of sit, sit with y'all, Steve and Grumdahlia.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:25]** And do you all start telling the story of how you, how you came to be there?

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** What do you do?

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:26]** What do you say?

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:32]** You don't need to go through all of it, but just like, what's the, what's the, no, we go through every last second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:34]** Yeah.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** We play all three seasons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:40]** Let's just listen to this podcast.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:42]** Rick just rolls back everywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:50]** It's crazy that we had time to produce and to record all of it while it was happening, but here it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:53]** Yeah, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:56]** Using Sirenscape the entire time.

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:00]** This music, can I just say, this is Sirenscape music.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:02]** It's quintessential.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** It is absolutely quintessential.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** This song is Sirenscape?

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** Yeah.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:12]** That is like, that's what makes me think of book one.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:15]** This has been since book one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:17]** I've never changed this mood.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** I've never changed this mood.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** It's been there.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:25]** It comes up when there's story, when there's narrative.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** It's a vibe.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** So what do you say?

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:31]** You're just telling them to listen to the podcast.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** You start with episode one.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:33]** No, I think we tell them.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** Yeah, what happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:41]** I'm getting no sense of, like... Yeah, can we sense motive real quick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** Sure, please.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:42]** Yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** The most useful... Right.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** Yeah, we talked about this.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:48]** It's been a long time since we've used one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:51]** I mean, great, but also... It's been a long time since we've used this.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** How many ranks have you put into it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** I'm going to do it right now.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** I also want to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:55]** Sure.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** I got a 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** You got a 24.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:00]** I got a 27.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:02]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** They seem just very friendly.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** They're honestly interested, curious.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:12]** They're a little refugee community that wants to help you out.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:16]** You're not getting any weird vibes from them at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:23]** If I were to cast Detect Thoughts, would they... You can't clandestinely cast that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:25]** So they would know that you're casting it.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:33]** So Rick, Rick will just play the, um, the plot armor episodes.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:35]** Okay.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:36]** Yeah.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:37]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:44]** Uh, here's, here's as a character is just going to be cautious, just him and then everything we've experienced.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:47]** So he's going to try to just say tele telepathically.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:52]** Uh, and thanks again, Jimmy T as always, cause I got to flip a coin.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** Yes, you do.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Um, to see if I say that out loud or not.

**[00:51:54 - 00:52:08]** heads it doesn't go out loud what do you say out loud fuck me all right well what do i say out loud yeah yeah because i'm guessing that you roll poorly i need to say it before i roll it yeah so um so here's this here's it's gonna be like

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** Oh, God.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** Yeah.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:14]** You got to you got to, like, prepare for these situations.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:19]** So to be wise, you know, you'll be like, you just improvise.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:26]** Here's will be like, you know, as with everyone out there, we need to be safe.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:37]** So I would say it would be no offense to these fine people if if we didn't reveal absolutely everything just because we need to watch our backs.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:39]** I'm sure they'd understand.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:46]** So just be selective about what you say, even though they're wonderful people.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:49]** Roll a D100.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:53]** Roll a D100.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** A D100?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** I'm confused what we're going to leave out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** Well, I don't know.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:00]** There's so much that could be said.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:03]** It's a general warning, okay?

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** But I rolled a 100.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** We didn't do anything shady.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:10]** We're in the same predicament as them, it sounds like.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** You rolled a what?

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** I rolled a 100.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:17]** I don't want to be deceptive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:17]** Wow.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:18]** Okay.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Great.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:23]** You say it totally in your... You say it telepathically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:27]** Rick nods, and then he plays plot armor from everything but Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:34]** But you do share about like...

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:44]** uh you share literally everything about in including your time with the grays um your reptoid theory like like well i guess someone does i guess someone does


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:48]** They are wrapped.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** I didn't want to, for the record.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** I'm just saying that from a hearer's perspective.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:51]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:53]** But if we do it, we do it.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** They are listening with such rapt attention.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** They are taking it in.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:59]** There's no judgment.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:03]** Maybe as you're looking around, you're going around, this person's telling this part, this person's telling this part.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:14]** Those of you who are listening, you look around, and their faces, for the most part, are focused solely on what you're saying and really engaged and just taking it all in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:41]** and and then their face opens up and then their grains yeah and then their jaw extends yeah uh no no that's that's they've shed their reptoid skin and it just melts off their face it's not fire oh god by this time they brought out like whale polyps and like snacking little small plates some papas bravas some some curly fries they've they've brought out
