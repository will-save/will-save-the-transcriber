## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:10]** Hello friends.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:21]** Welcome to my channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:21]** How are we doing?

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:26]** Let's get ready for episode one of day one and we'll see you in the podcast!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** We'll see!

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:27]** We'll see!

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** Woo!

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** Coming out hot like a rocket, you know what I'm saying?

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:30]** We'll see.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:32]** Like fireworks.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:35]** Like some fireworks like we just had last weekend until the 4th.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:37]** That's right.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** Question.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** I pride myself.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:44]** This is my just thought of this banter.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:48]** If you were a rocket, what would your rocket name be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** Florida man.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:51]** What?

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:52]** Florida man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** Florida, yeah, it's very true.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:01:56 - 00:02:00]** It would, like, f***ing jump and be wild and somehow land up in your house.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** You'd light it off.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:03]** There's a 60% chance it leaves the ground.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:06]** 40% it just blows up right in front of you.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:17]** If it does leave the ground, it explodes in, like, a giant gator, but then the gator, like, swoops down sort of like Gandalf's dragon and, like, climbs fences and s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:19]** How are your kids, like, okay?

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:22]** And there's a 1% chance that it just ends up in your house and eats all your food.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Trial by fire.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:25]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:26]** Who knows?

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** Uh...

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Okay.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:31]** I think, I feel like Vinny's the most reasonable man from Florida I've met though.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** So that's a compliment.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** It's good.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** You see him less.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Oh, well, John's here too, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:40]** A firework rocket or like a ballistic missile type rocket?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** A firework rocket.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** That's a good question.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:46]** I answered like a firework rocket, but I guess maybe a ballistic rocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** That's what I was thinking was like a firework.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:52]** But I thought you were talking about like a launch vehicle.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:53 - 00:03:19]** was like all the good ones already taken but fireworks is a lot more open and creative i think okay then i'm gonna go with skyquake skyquake not the time lord huh i like skyquake are these are we naming these rockets and describing them what are we doing again yeah exactly what what would the name of your rocket be if you were a rocket okay uh all right uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:24]** Mine would be the Trojan horse, and it would be a horse that explodes.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** Before it takes off.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** You know what I mean?

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:36]** When you get the pack of rocket parts, it would be one of those like... Right, yeah, yeah, exactly.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:44]** So it's just like the container looks like a wooden horse, and then it just has 15 minutes of explosions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** I love it.

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:49]** That matches the chaos of Kevin very well, I think.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:49]** Yeah, it does.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** It really does.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** I guess mine would be the magic missile.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** I mean, I guess it's easier.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:54]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:55]** Wow.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:55]** Wow.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** Chase people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** Yeah.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** It's a target-seeking Roman candle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:03]** Yeah.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:08]** First, it actually goes as far away from you as possible.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Roman candle.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** And then it comes back and hits you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:11]** Yeah, they're fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** I have not actually.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** But one time my mom was chased by a ground flower.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:18]** You guys know the ground flowers?

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** It's just like the little sticks.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:23]** One of them, she like jumped and ran away from it and it just kept following her.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:27]** I don't know if it was like an airflow type thing or what.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:31]** I've never actually done a Roman candle fight though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** Oh, those are fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:33]** They're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:37]** As long as they don't escalate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** Or you don't fire it off into somebody's home.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:43]** I mean, as long as it's at my house when I had one.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:44]** Yikes.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** It woke up somebody who was taking a nap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:48]** They were not pleased.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** I would imagine not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Because they got hit by one?

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** They were sleeping?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:54]** It flew into the open door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:26]** oh the ground like right next to him oh god yeah yikes speaking of exploding grounds um what so when i lived in south carolina we took a trip up to north carolina um to myrtle beach and on the way back down we stopped and got some explosives and found a beach where you could literally or legally shoot off fireworks so we got a bunch of mortars and all that you know all the ridiculous fireworks that you're never allowed to have in california yeah legally um legally


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:34]** and you shouldn't do illegal fireworks right people i'm the one that buys and brings those to fourth of july yeah yeah exactly yeah that's my one job all year


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:45]** But we were like it was it was actually like middle of non fourth of July time and we're like let's find this beach It's where we're not getting arrested for doing this and we had all sorts of stuff, right?

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:57]** so we're shooting mortars off into the sky and having a good time and Then one at one point my friend it was like just the three three you guys on an empty beach doing this and all of a sudden my friend starts running away and giggling and

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:59]** And we're like, what the fuck?

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** And then the sand just explodes.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:07]** It looks like a war movie, like this bright blue explosion, like a plasma ball.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:08]** Oh, my God.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:11]** And the sand separates and then collapses back down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:15]** I never would have expected Kevin to have a Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** Exactly.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:21]** That's such a scary proposition.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** He buried the mortar.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:42]** And we didn't have any... We couldn't find a lighter or matches because we were too young.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** We had a magnifying glass.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:55]** Hold on.

**[00:07:55 - 00:08:02]** And then we ran away, and it blew a hole in the asphalt and lit off some car alarms.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:06]** It was a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:06]** Oh, my God.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** 90s are a big boom.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:08]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:10]** Old-fashioned destruction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** Yeah.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:16]** I may or may not be shopping for a few additional fireworks to even out the show.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** I went a little hard this year.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** I need fireworks.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** No.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:23]** I was in the desert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** In Joshua Tree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:28]** The desert seems like a good place to shoot fireworks.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** According to Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:33]** Yeah.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** Yeah, not in Joshua Tree National Park.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** I saw fireworks in the sky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** Distant stars.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** Distant stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** Distant suns.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** Universal fireworks.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:47]** Yeah.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:53]** I think if I had a name for my firework, it would just be called the Swan Song.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** And it's the last firework you're ever going to shoot off.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:56]** But it's beautiful.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** Wait, why the last?

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:01]** Because that's what a swan song is.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:04]** Until it murders you.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** Until it murders you.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:07]** So just Kevin, hand me a firework.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** Be like, good luck.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:11]** Appropriate for, I think, what we're about to get into next.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** I think so.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** I think so.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:15]** Kelly, any shout outs?

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:17]** Because I want to get into the fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** but I know there are some shout outs.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:28]** There's no shout outs, but like, except to say that there's been more, like, you guys have been rating us five stars so far on like Spotify.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** I've been noticing there's been more than being added.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:31]** Keep it up.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** Don't go with changing.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:38]** If you have less than five, just email us privately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:42]** Yeah, email us and we'll try to solve it and then like get you to rate us a five, okay?

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** And yeah, you should do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:49]** We do try and respond to Apple podcasts.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** Thoughts, complaints, things that happen.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** We try to be quick.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:52]** Get to them.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:58]** So to pull the curtain back a little bit, there's a handful of ways that we can grow the podcast, right?

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:02]** And I think we all want this to reach as many people as would be interested.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:09]** One of the biggest ways we do that is by rating us five stars on whatever platform you used to listen.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:32]** um that's the best possible way for us to be served to other uh additional people to like grow our audience on our website we all want to share this story just go on to spotify or apple and rate us five stars there because yeah or amazon and if you know anybody who might like this who likes tabletop even if they don't even if they just like sci-fi even if they don't like sci-fi


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:38]** If they like story-driven content, then please be like, hey, we'll say this is the place for you.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:41]** If they don't like story-driven content, maybe just don't hang out with them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:44]** Just convince your mom to also rate us five stars.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:45]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:51]** Or your figure in your life who fulfills that role for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** Great.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:53]** That's true.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** They don't have to be listeners.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** You can just ask people to rate us.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:59]** I don't want fake ratings.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:59 - 00:10:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:02]** Even people you don't know.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:05]** No, don't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:09]** Disperse a QR code that automatically rates us five stars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:10]** That's it.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** Ask your friends.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:12]** Ask your partners.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:15]** Ask your maternal and paternal caregivers.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** Ask your fireworks guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** Ask your fireworks guy.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Let him know.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:23]** You know how you make your girlfriend watch, like, Lord of the Rings and she hates it?

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** That's what you got to do with us.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** Just play it.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** And, like, we're in a place you can't escape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:30]** I never thought I'd say this, but we are the new Lord of the Rings.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:30]** Yes.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:31]** Yep.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** That's it.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** Okay.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:33]** Wow.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** That's a big game.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:34]** Jokes.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Jokes.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:35]** Oh, God.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** It's going to be taken out of context.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** We're coming for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** George Lucas, we're coming for you.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:47]** By the time it gets to my show, it's going to be like the Rings of Power.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** That's what mine's going to be.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** So then it's not going to be as good as the trilogy.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** It's all right, though.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** We'll have fun.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** We'll try to have fun.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:56]** I actually like Rings of Power a lot, but I haven't seen it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:58]** I just heard it's kind of bad.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** It's good.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:01]** You should watch it first and then decide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:05]** With that, thank you all for just saying those.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** Unknown Treasures is The Hobbit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:11]** Yeah, that's kind of true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:13]** Like the first Hobbit or the whole trilogy.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** Like the good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** The animated Hobbit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** The animated Hobbit.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:19]** We don't have a similian or whatever.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Silmarillion.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** Silmarillion, the plot armors are that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** Yeah, that's what that's for.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:29]** Also, thank you to you all for being fantastic.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** Also, thank you to ScienceGate for being our partner in music.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:35]** If you dig them, then you should go check them out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:37]** And continue to listen because we might have some cool stuff coming up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** we have some cool stuff coming up.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:49]** Also speaking of plot armor, one last thing, uh, in this episode and on our discord, if you want to join, you can send us the questions that you, that are in your brain that you're hearing.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:52]** And you're like, I heard you say this one thing one time, doctor.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** Okay.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** And I want to know more about that from your character.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:59]** Please tell me more, uh, fill out that form, that questionnaire, that link in the description of this episode.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:00]** Yep.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** Yep.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** Yep.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** Exactly.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:02]** Do it.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:06]** Send it, send it, send it, send it, send it.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:07]** All right, everybody.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** Want to note one thing.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:14]** Did anyone do the episode or the sentence last episode?

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:16]** If.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** I don't think so.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** I didn't hear one.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** So, I think it stays in effect.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:23]** Yeah.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:23]** It stays in effect.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:26]** So, whoever you are among you four.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** Did you send the sentence?

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** Are you sure?

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** I sent a sentence to a person.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** Did you send it to like some spam folder?

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:32]** Send it again.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** I think I sent it to one of the bots that have jumped into our Discord.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:38]** You sent it to the art person?

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:40]** I sent it to, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:48]** Well, we can dance around all these explosions as much as we want.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:53]** But at some point, we got to get back to the episode and what is happening.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:56]** And I am stoked to do it.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:01]** But like I said, we've crossed the episode 150 threshold.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** Things are different.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:10]** So, again, I'm going to ask you guys to close your eyes.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** Kev has one eye open.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** I see you, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** I know, because I was, like, working on something.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:20]** I was, like, planning my moves, and then you're like, oh, close your eyes.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:21]** I'm like, I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** No, you can close your eyes.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Anyways, I don't have my eyes closed.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** No, that's fine.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** You can roll them.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:26]** It's what you want.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** Yeah, be like, oh, gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** Yeah.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:31]** Let's play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** Let's take a second.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:36]** Breathe in.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:39]** That's out.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:42]** And breathe out.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:58]** Because as you're breathing out, you do start to hear the sound of snow biting against your skin as we open on a white screen.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** Sorry?

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:01]** There's a sound to that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Yeah.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:02]** Ah, it hurts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** It's like... So there's a...

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** Just teeth chattering.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:20]** Picture a white screen and the wind howling with this eerie, otherworldly chime out of phase singing across the landscape.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:22]** The visibility is low.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:26]** You can make out several mounds maybe 50 feet ahead of you.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** That's it.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** The drone here is...

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:46]** empty as you feel like there are probably no ears around to hear this singing for many many miles and those who have heard it know better than to listen again

**[00:15:48 - 00:16:03]** Slowly the landscape begins to move up and the camera down and we see the permafrost and the ground and then black rock slowly appear as the camera just starts getting deeper and deeper and deeper.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:13]** The chimes fading away as we see veins of purple rocks slowly creep into the upper crust like a virus spreading.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:24]** The deeper we get, we start to hear the sound of worrying equipment growing louder.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** until our camera starts to reveal a room.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:35]** We're about 20 feet above some sort of medium-sized lab chamber.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:46]** Purple rock domes out overhead as we see these metal pipes and rods, conduits, growing like stalactites down to the equipment below.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:56]** We keep panning as the camera lowers further, and we see that many of these rods converge into clusters over four cold days.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:06]** medical operating tables, three of which are in dim or near darkness.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:27]** And other than the sterile blue-orange computer lights at the perimeter of the room, there's just a single metal lamp that illuminates both the fourth operating table and the beating heart in the open chest

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:28]** laying on the table.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:45]** It's critical here that you pierce three nanometers to the right of the ventricle, up to five nanometers, then pronate 34 degrees and continue piercing upwards.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:56]** Dwarf cardiovascular topology is notoriously convoluted as it seeks to hide its treasured unfiltered bloodstream even from itself.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:10]** What looks like human hands enter the illuminated circle, sliding the needle cleanly into the beating heart, and then pronating with precision, just like the instructions.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:18]** Are you confident in their dexterity?

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:25]** A second voice lingers on the word, watching the hands incrementally move forward.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:27]** There's something machine-like about them.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:31]** Such questions were put to bed with the cohort.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:33]** Trial results, the first voice counters.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:43]** If they can fire a rifle with deadly precision, then they can learn to operate with such precision, which is why this isn't their first time doing this.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:49]** From the silence of the shifting feet, it's clear this is news to that second doctor.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** There's a...

**[00:18:52 - 00:19:01]** soft sound of a vacuum as blood begins being drawn through the syringe and into an opaque tube just out of the light.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** Good, good, 18.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:09]** Don't forget to double stitch their cavity and burn it lest they rip it open again.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:11]** Ah, the brutes.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:15]** How do they not know that this could secure their future?

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:24]** The senior doctor muses out loud and you hear the voice turning away as they turn their attention away from what's going on on the table.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:28]** That's why we are tasked with showing them.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:31]** Computer lights on after the nascent blood is safe.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:45]** A few moments later, the ambient light level rises, revealing the bunch of red hair on this prone, fair dwarf, the hands meticulously sewing up their chest cavity.

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** Off to the left,

**[00:19:49 - 00:20:03]** We see two reptoids with dark, shifting emerald scales standing in lab coats, their crests furrowing along their forehead as they absentmindedly check their comms devices.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:15]** If you can picture it, the senior doc is played by Carrie Coon, and the taller second doctor is played by Jason Isaacs.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:20]** after a few moments of silence as they're just scrolling.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:27]** Look, the Broken Rock test site is yours, Owen.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:33]** It's a perfect stepping stone for you, the senior doctor kind of states without even looking up.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:38]** The human body is easy and, frankly, simple to navigate.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:48]** It will get you into most of Broken Rock's cultureless locales and put the degenerate denizens at ease.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:55]** The question is, though, do I want to lead and miss the smell of blood?

**[00:20:56 - 00:21:00]** Takes a sip of some green liquid.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:10]** Fill out reports in silence instead of among the chorus of voices recanting fresh, cherished memories.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:14]** It is a dauntingly monotonous task.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:19]** Plus, I would be absent for the critical, morrow specimens.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:25]** The sound of a cauterizing torch lights up on the dwarf's body.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** Look, here's where I'm at.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:39]** I'm working on this new communication style of sort of duplicitous manipulation to say difficult things, sort of a positive to negative response.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:41]** So working on something like, you know,

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:50]** I'd love to help count me in for Broken Rock, but I just first need to finish my training.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:58]** They're cut off by the sound of a pump and heavy water running as the android begins to clean hands and tools.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:02]** I've already told her you accept it.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:06]** If you feel like you can't do the job, bring help.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:10]** I can coach you through building the protocols for training.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:14]** There is only you who I would bring to trust.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:17]** And as I have said, I am not going to be leaving.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:20]** 18, you may actually leave, please.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** But first.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:30]** They straighten their back, put down the tools, and wait for instructions.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** Do not go to your cell, 18.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:43]** Report immediately to the docking bay, and wait for Dr. Owen to arrive.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** You can't be serious.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:51]** That machine right there will be a burden on me and my entire... You may go, 18.

**[00:22:51 - 00:23:01]** And as the voice of an incredulous Dr. Owen fades into the background, we see the individual walking towards the exit.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** They stop.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:08]** Wait for a red light above a red door.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:12]** And the camera begins to swing around

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:25]** And we see the emotionless face of Rick 19 and the edge of his lips raise ever so slightly into a smile.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:38]** The glow of a green light hits his face as the screen cuts to black and we hear the familiar hiss as the doors open.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:43]** So

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:48]** Let's come back to our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** What's happening, John?

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** What's happening, indeed.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** And my eyes were closed, so I didn't get to take any of those notes.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** I was just listening.

**[00:23:59 - 00:23:59]** That's true.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** That's true.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:00]** It's fine.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:03]** Who knows what's happening, Kev?

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:07]** I just get a weekly letter that tells me some things.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** I'm sharing the contents.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:11]** You know, that's it.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** That's it.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:13]** Thoughts?

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:18]** I'm pausing because every time that I just keep going and steamroll through it, Kev's always like, hang on, hang on, hang on.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** I need to talk about that.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:20]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:24]** And I'm still like absorbing this and trying to like write down the notes on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** It's dark in there.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** It was dark until the ambient light level came up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:32]** It's dark in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:35]** And then it was still kind of dark just in like a metaphysical sense.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:35]** You're right.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** Well, that's true.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** Well.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:42]** If there's no thoughts, then it's time to give up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:45]** I... That was... I have a thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** Here's... Go ahead.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** Oh, no.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** It's just a comment.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:54]** It's probably... But, like, when you kept calling him 18, I... Originally, I was like, oh, maybe that's, like, Rick 18.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** You know what I mean?

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:59]** But then, like, with Rick on the table there, I don't know.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:02]** Although technically it was a dwarf on the table.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** Where the was Rick smiling again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:10]** There's so much like- He said Ricky, the 18, quote unquote 18, walked out.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:11]** Oh yeah, yeah.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:17]** And in the hallway, the camera panned around revealing Rick 19 and then Rick 19 smiled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** I got it, I got it.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:22]** Which doesn't make any sense to me as the Rick 19 player.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** This evil revealing smile.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:25]** I know.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** Murderbot smile.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** Yeah.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** Murderbot smile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:30]** Who knows?

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:31]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** Vinny, you had a thought?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** I was still trying to form it.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:46]** It's just a weird, like, what significance does this have on our current story?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:50]** Only time will tell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:51]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:53]** Only time will tell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** Well, and the other thing is it could be a Rick 19.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** It could be Rick 18.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:59]** You're just like the...

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:24]** the way he said it was it revealed rick 19 so like it would make sense that it it was actually rick 18 that looks just like rick 19 right yeah so now we're gonna face off against an evil rick 19 that's a good idea right write that down john go ahead yeah forgot thanks appreciate that we had to like fight all the ricks at once that would be something yeah it's like scott pilgrim


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:43]** yeah yeah it's like rick from rick and morty it's like the yeah the council of rick hey guys yeah we're just a bunch of morty you're ready to go in rick's world yeah oh god yeah i don't want that well let's play let's get back into the combat let's just go right to it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** Let's go right to it.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:46]** Bring you guys back.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** I don't want to.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** Do you want to stay?

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:49]** I don't know.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:51]** I don't know, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** Good question.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:54]** Good question.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** As Will said, all will be revealed in time.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** All will be revealed in time.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:03]** Look, last episode, I just want to say, super short recap.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:09]** I think you guys, I feel like the needle in this fight is moving a little bit.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:15]** Granted, I know the stats of the other opponents, but I can see it happening.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** I can see ties are starting to be mixed.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:27]** Whereas this started out strong with a bunch of successful hits or spells from Dr. Nodens and some maneuvering.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:30]** And then I feel like things are starting to happen now.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:36]** You guys are starting to really dig deep, bring out the arsenal.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:39]** Any thoughts that you want to share with me before we begin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** Okay.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:40]** Don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:41]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** I don't feel great about this fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:43]** You don't feel great.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:44]** Okay.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:44]** All right.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:45]** I feel like we're close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** Hopefully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:49]** Okay.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:49]** Possibly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** Possibly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:52]** Freaking dudes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** Get rid of the West Seltz first.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** Yeah.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** And then.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:56]** Get rid of the ads.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:59]** That's what I'm trying to do anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** Okay, fair.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:00]** I like it.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:02]** I'm also not in a pit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** Very true.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:03]** You are in a pit.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:07]** I think the wet cell is the most dangerous one because it's got that sickening thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:10]** When we're done with that, we can come get you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** I'm sorry.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:15]** We had one character tell two of us exactly what it wanted us to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** They only have so many spell slots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** I mean, they're NPCs.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:23]** They have a theoretically unlimited number of spell slots.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** I wouldn't do that, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:26]** I play by the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** They have N plus one spell slots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** N plus one spell slots, yeah.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:34]** With that, let's go back to the combat right now.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:39]** We're back on Foundry, our dojo for the fight.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** It is Officer Astara's turn.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:42]** I don't see it.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:44]** Ended last time with her stepping up.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:44]** What's up, Will?

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** You want to reload?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:50]** Oh, did I not hit activate?

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** I just hit activate.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** Thank you, Will.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** Hey, there you are.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** Should I still reload?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** Zoom, zoom.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:57]** I don't think you need to.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** I just activated it.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** You should be able to see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:04]** So we're in the hangar with the Void Crier and the platform is dropping down.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:08]** So the Void Crier is on one platform and then there's another platform next to it.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:11]** And the adjacent platform is the one we're standing on.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** That's being lowered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:15]** And Rick and Colin are in a lowered portion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Ten feet down.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** Clarifying question.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:21]** Is that platform still moving or did it stop at ten feet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:22]** It stopped at ten feet.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** Okay.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:24]** Yep.


## Speaker_0

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:24]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:29]** Just enough to allow some access to, you know, what's underneath.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** Change out the septic tank, things like that.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:32]** All right.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:44]** There's the sound of the clock sword behind you, Rick19, as Officer Astara steps up with a guarded step that you graciously allowed me to take.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:50]** And... You shake your head with incredulousness.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** And...

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** Let's see.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:56]** That is an 18 against KSC.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** I feel like that doesn't hit.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** That's a miss.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** That's a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Oh, that's a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Oh, that's a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** Oh, that's a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:04]** All right.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:11]** Well, they are just the swarm is making them see shapes that are not there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** I'll let that one slide this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** Thank you.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** I thank you for that.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** That's a freebie.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:19]** You didn't need to, but you're just, you're just out of the kindness of your heart.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** Uh, that was their turn.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Here's Fabricius.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:23]** What are you doing?

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:24]** You still haven't entered the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:26]** Yeah.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** Here's Fabricius.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** Doesn't really need to enter the room yet.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:29]** Uh, hold on.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** I'm waiting for my thing to load.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** Oh, there we go.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** So here's, it's going to like try to take out this wet salt.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:37]** Still don't kill the ads, kill the ads.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:37]** He's all wet.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** He's almost dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:46]** So if you're going to do a full attack, can't you split it up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:46]** I can split it up.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** Yeah.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** I just don't know if that's... You have three missiles.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:52]** I know, but I'm not sure if that is true because you never know how you're going to roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:54]** We're all assuming you're going to do a magic missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:56]** No, no.

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:00]** What I'm saying is I don't know if two missiles will kill him or not, for example.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** But... Sure.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:02]** Like...

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:04]** why not?

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:07]** Like, uh, yeah, I'll roll and maybe two will be enough.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:16]** Uh, so 13, he's gonna attack, uh, the wet salt with, um, with, uh, nine points of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:19]** So, okay.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:22]** So nine points of it go to the wet salt and what happens to the other four?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:26]** And then the other four points, uh, go to, uh,

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:29]** Officer Astara, unfortunately.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:31]** Officer Astara.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** Yeah, very unfortunate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:35]** Yeah, she's really cool, so.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** She says, hey, do you hear us?

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** No.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** She doesn't say anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:40]** She doesn't talk to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** Remember?

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:47]** The two magic missiles that hit the Wetzelt

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** Kill the wet selt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:53]** As the wet selt is now dead.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** Well done.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** Good call, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** That was just, you know.

**[00:31:59 - 00:31:59]** Will's playbook.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:01]** Thinking back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:31]** i thought it was like maybe one or two points away yeah it could be the electromagnetic field is dispersed you have killed the wet zelt amazing as the third missile hits officer astara like yeah here feels really bad because it's like kind of the coolest thing that like he's ever seen especially with that weapon yeah so you want to take it back no it's okay so then like so then he says like he just says to the group he's like have you ever seen a grown sheeran cry well you're about to

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** And he can't cry, right?

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:35]** So he has like a little eyedropper that he like puts like below his eye.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:38]** Because he feels really bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** That's a move action at least, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** Whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:46]** He invokes the rule of flavor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:46 - 00:33:06]** the rule of his little like sex vandal things whatever the sex mandibles little arms yeah is that what you were thinking and then you actually you you meant to say it tell telepathically and then you said it out loud it's a grunge rock band name


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** Have you ever seen a Grown Sheeran cry?

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:10]** Amazing.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** All right, you want to do anything else with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:17]** No, I mean, with the artificial tears and the full attack, there's nothing we really can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:20]** Our artificial tears are a no-move action.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:22]** It's a swift action to apply teardrops.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** Yeah, he has some on him.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** It's actually a move action to cry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** He's got a little container to clear his eyes.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** Yeah.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:35]** Um, effect, uh, turns to Dr. Okay.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** It says, thanks again, Dr. Okay.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** That so much better.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** Let's let's help them out.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:47]** Moves 15 feet going to fire a needle or pistol at officer Astara.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** Don't forget she takes damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** Let's see.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:54]** Let's see what happens when she does that.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:57]** That is going to be.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** There we go.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** That's what I was hoping for.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** Oh, a natural one.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:03]** I didn't look at the die for that whole time.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:07]** That is a natural one against a named character.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:07]** Do I need to roll?

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** No.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** I think she just fails the attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:17]** Do NPCs get cards?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** No.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** I kind of feel like not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** I agree with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** Shot goes wild.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** And she's like, f***.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** Because that's just who she is.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** Yeah.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:34]** Yeah, she has not been great in this combat.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:34]** And she knows it.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:37]** And she's like, I need to f***ing help them as much as possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** I'm a tree and steward.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** I know how to do combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:43]** I'm a murder bot.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** I know how to do combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** And a surgeon, apparently.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** And a surgeon.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:54]** Do I get bonuses to my medicine?

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** Just asking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:57]** Bonuses to your medicine.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** Who knows?

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:58]** Who knows?

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:02]** It is... I know what's going to happen.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:05]** I know what is going to happen.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** Uh-oh.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:07]** Uh-oh.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:07]** Okay.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:11]** Orvier Pike drops the gun.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:17]** Jumps down.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** Massive individual.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** Wisp ally follows him.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:34]** And, ooh, I think I know what he does.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:39]** He's going to jump down after having dropped the gun.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:41]** Actually, one thing, he doesn't drop the gun.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** He jumps down with a gun.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:43]** Sorry.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** I'm like trying to think through this in real time.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:49]** He jumps down with a gun and then fires at you, Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:50]** Okay.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** I'll take an attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** Did you already take an attack of opportunity?

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** No, because it's round five.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** Go ahead, my friend.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** Against KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** Oh, my God.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:03]** That was a 4 plus 8 for 12 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:03]** Nope.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** That is not a hit, unfortunately.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:08]** He also, I don't think, hits.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:10]** That's a 20 against KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:12]** That is a meets beats.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** That's a meets beats.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** Oh, okay.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:16]** Meets beats, he says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:17]** Oh, wait.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:19]** With Spal, I get a plus 2.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** What did I say I had?

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** 4, 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** I thought he gets a minus 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:27]** I did covering fire instead of harrying fire.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:36]** He's been on harrying fire instead of covering fire, so the first attack gets plus two on the... And for how many rounds was that?

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** For six rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:38]** Six rounds.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Okay, cool.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:42]** So six rounds, so that means that you get plus two to that?

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** Yeah, so I forget.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:46]** I had a four on the die, I think.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** So, 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** Oh, to your first attack against him.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:52]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:55]** That was for the attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** Yes, indeed.

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:00]** Thank you.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** But he's within 10 feet.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:08]** He's a ranged attack within... Yeah, it's a reach weapon.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Yeah, I remember.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** I just didn't...

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** Remember the mechanic.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** Yeah, we got a lot going.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:13]** We got a lot going.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** That is 14 points of damage to you, Rick19.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** That's 13 points of damage.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Okay.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:19]** Well, thank you.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:20]** Thank you for that.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:22]** Appreciate that little correction there.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** That was nice.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:24]** That was nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:25]** Still have stamina.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** Not a whole lot, but still have stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:28]** Okay.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** Dr. Okay, where are you?

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** What's going on?

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:32]** What's else down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** Yeah, seeing the dead Wetzel in front of Dr. Okay.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:39]** He's going to focus on the other foes.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** And I think...

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:51]** I don't know if Bernice can actually see anyone since they're 10 feet down, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:56]** Yeah, Bernice probably cannot see Officer Astara.

**[00:37:56 - 00:38:04]** So right now for the listeners at home, Officer Astara, Rick, Colin, and Orvier, and Dr. Nones are in this 10-foot pit.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:09]** But Officer Astara is closer to the wall that Bernice is in.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** So I think Bernice couldn't see Astara.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Yeah, for sure.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** Orvier's across the pit, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:21]** So I think she's going to stay in place and take a shot at Orvier real quick.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Take a shot at Orvier.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:27]** That is a 17 against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** 17 against EAC.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** Ooh.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** Close, but no cigar.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** Close, but no cigar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:35]** Okay.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** So Orvier's tough, dude.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:41]** Then is going to walk over across the dead corpse of the wet soul.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:48]** Oh, come near to the edge so he can get a shot off.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:59]** And he's going to load up his Spark of Ingenuity, which allows you to combine two biohacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:01]** Oh!

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** All right.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** Impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** He is going for it.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:13]** And he's going to just try and ace one on Orvir with the...

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:19]** pharmacological inhibitor and the basic inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:27]** That is a natural 20.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:27]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:29]** No way.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** Get it, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:32]** All right.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:36]** It says yeet on my dice and yeet shall not return.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:36]** It says yeet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Amazing.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:38]** Amazing.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:47]** And I found out that on the Decimator Costaja, that raises the DC of injection by two on a critical.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:48]** Oh.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** Which is pretty dope.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:51]** That is dope.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:52]** So we have two things.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:57]** So he's got the roll for your injections, and we also have the crit to work through.

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:59]** You want to do the double damage, or you want to take the card?

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** Yeah, let's do the double damage first.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** Let's do the double damage.

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:06]** He's taking the double damage, the daily double here.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:06]** So that's four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** Do I just double my 2d8 roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:11]** I thought that it was either your double damage.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:15]** The card replaces the crit.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:24]** Because the critical, if I'm reading this correctly, it says critical injection plus two, and then it says double damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** So I think the crit is the plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** Yeah, so the double damage is the crit.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:57]** yeah but you could i think you can take the card i think will's right you can either take the card or you can take some cards say three three x damage yeah it's fine okay so do i roll twice you roll you roll you do the whole thing twice so whatever your roll plus do that roll plus time that in parentheses times two so that's uh five plus five so ten ten plus yeah so double to twenty


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** Okay, so I'm doing that double 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:02]** Oh, God.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** All right.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:08]** And then... And then what's the DC that he has to roll?

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:14]** 18 for... You're going to be encumbered no matter what, but you're going to be entangled.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:17]** It's a DC 18 fort save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:20]** DC 18 fort save to not be... Entangled.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:22]** Entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:24]** And then on the basic inhibitor...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:28]** Let me roll that fort save to see real quick.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:30]** Oh!

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** He got a natural one, man.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:37]** I mean, it's not there, but it's nine total, so he fails it.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:37]** Fails it.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:43]** All right, so he is entangled and encumbered for how many rounds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** I believe seven rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:46 - 00:42:13]** seven and then you're also gonna take a minus two to your ac minus two to ac okay that came in because of the basic inhibitor dude that is insane awesome he is not happy with that not happy with that at all entangled and encumbered encumbered just means for are you listening at home that is speeds reduced by 10 feet max dex bonus to your armor class is plus two

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** which is kind of insane.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** That is a rough one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** Okay.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:22]** Also, you take a minus five penalty to strength and dexterity base checks.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** Right.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:23]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** Base checks.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:27]** Or you take your armor's check penalty.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:27]** Okay.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** Got it.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:31]** So it's not necessarily attack rolls, but any check that requires strength or dex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** I feel like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:32]** Got it.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** That absolutely hurt.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:38]** 20 points of damage, minus to the AC.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** See, this is what I was saying.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** I was sensing a shift in the tides a little bit.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** Impressive.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** Impression.

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** Impressive, yeah.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** Colin Edenbrand, what are you doing?

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:53]** Dr. O'Kay steps up right behind you.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:58]** You see this shot just really debilitate Orvier unexpectedly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:08]** Colin is going to take a five-foot step closer to Orvier Pike because we're just going to body him.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:19]** And just reach out and try to grab his forearm to cast fatigue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:23]** Oh, I would love if you didn't do that.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** He's already fatigued just from life.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:26]** He's had a hard week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:36]** That's a four on the D20 for a total of four, eight, twelve.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** Twelve on the die against EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:47]** Twelve on the die against EAC is not enough against Orvier Pike.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** Even with all the minuses.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Then I'm going to take a five foot step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:56]** And to be clear, is that five foot step guarded?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:00]** It is not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:03]** It can't be because that's not splitting your move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** No, it's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:05]** Okay.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** Here's my question.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** I think the answer is no.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:09]** Just kind of a little preview.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** He's holding a two-handed weapon.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:14]** He is able to make unarmed attacks.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:18]** I feel like he probably is not going to let go of his gun to make an unarmed attack.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:21]** Does he have improved unarmed strike?

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** Improved unarmed strike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:29]** Because improved unarmed strike lets you do an attack of opportunity while holding a weapon.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:30]** He doesn't.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:30]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** Good luck.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:32]** Cool.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:32]** Moving on.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** You're good, Colin Edenbrand.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** You're good today, sir.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:37]** Sir?

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** All right.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** Dr. Rel Nodens.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:44]** The mastermind behind it.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** What does she do?

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** What does she do?

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** She takes a little guarded step back.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** And as she does...

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:55]** You see that she is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** Did she just leave on a threatened swear?

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** With a guarded step.

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:00]** She took a guarded step.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:00]** Okay.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:01]** Okay.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:01]** Okay.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** She guarded steps back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:10]** And she brings out her data pen.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** Which I believe is a move action.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:14]** Status return.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** Rick19, what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** I'm taking notes currently.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** Solid.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** Excellent.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:31]** Rick takes a guarded step and he kind of just fades into the cloud and then reappears one step further.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** Oh, I'm still in ruler mode.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:33]** Sorry.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:33]** Hold on.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:34]** Okay.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:36]** Okay.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:36]** How do I move?

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** There it goes.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** Yeah.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** And he just kind of shifts over to the other side of the cloud.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:41]** Yeah.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:41]** Sweet.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:42]** Sweet.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:42]** You think what?

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** You think what, John?

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** Sweet guarded step.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** That's all I was going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:48]** You hear collective gasps and a small round of applause from the audience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** Yeah.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:55]** I was going to step a little closer, but now where I'm standing, I can attack all three.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** How dare you.

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:01]** But I'm going to just do a standard attack on Nodens.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Give me a standard attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** And I hope you fail.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** That was a bad roll.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** It was a three-up die for a total of four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:39]** 11 points or 11 to hit nope yeah doesn't quite get it tonight doesn't quite get it okay no worries officer astara's turn officer astara she doesn't even notice effect this horrible shot against her she doesn't care about that she is going to uh what does she want to do here what does she want to do who does she want to go for i think she's going to take a step put down her weapons

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:42]** in between Colin and Rick so she can take out both of yous.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** What kind of step was that?

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** Guarded step.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** And thanks for being on it.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:52]** She's going to swing her second clock sword at

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:53]** Rick 19.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** That's a natural 20.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:58]** So beautiful.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:58]** So beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:01]** Go ahead and roll concealment before I go any further.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** Oh, you're right.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:02]** You're right.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** I do got to roll that concealment.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:08]** If she rolls less than a 10, I'm going to throw my dice across the wall.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** That is a 57.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** She's good.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** She good.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** She good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:15]** Can anything go well for Rick tonight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:16]** All right.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:20]** That is going to be double on the damage against you.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** Let's see what that's going to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:25]** Oh, that's gonna be... What's it gonna be?

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:29]** 28 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** 27 points of damage.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:33]** 27 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** Yeah, 27.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** How are you, Rick?

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:38]** I am well into my hit points now.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:39]** So, yeah.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:41]** Rick steps forward.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** He's focused on Nodens.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:45]** And Astara goes into his cloud.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** And he feels that.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** But it's not enough.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:50]** And he turns and just gets hit by the sword.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:53]** Right across the chest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** Yeah.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** Yeah.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:55]** Ruff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** Here's Fabricius, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:58]** Round five.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:11]** Right, so looking over our rules conversation that we had about Artificial Geyser and where lines start and end in the rules and mistakes channel, it seems like the consensus is that they can start anywhere within a 60-foot range.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:12]** I think so.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:13]** That's probably right.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:22]** Yeah, so what Gears is going to do is he's going to cast Artificial Geyser in a line between Officer Astara and Orvir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:43]** know what i mean if i can cast it anywhere can i cast it in between the line between los angeles and where you are yeah yeah if it's perfect i'm just kidding all right so in between astara and orvier yeah he wants to get both you're saying a straight line through them yes through the two of them he wants to cast it here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:48:43 - 00:49:05]** which is just that's exactly right i just can't pointing down i just don't know how to bark so just just for the listeners we're now like staggered kind of it's colin in one square astara just next to him and then directly below astara is orvier and then rick is one more set of squares over so the straight line will go between colin and rick and not touch them


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:08]** but it will hit both Stara and Orv here.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:11]** Yeah, this is the rules paralegals consensus.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:13]** So he does that.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:16]** If there's no disagreements, I pause because you never know.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:22]** But like he, so that means that there's, that's going to be- Finders not actively listening.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** Let's not, we're not picking that channel again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** So there's 10-


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:38]** damage from let's start with that first so first from that there's the 10 fire damage right so then like uh now they need to roll uh yeah they need to roll uh

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** A reflex saving throw.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:43]** And they have to beat a DC of 17.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** So, that's what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** DC of 17.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** Reflex saving throw.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:50]** Reflex saving throw.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:52]** For Officer Astara.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:53]** Slashing a fire damage.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:56]** That is going to be a fail.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** Okay.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:57]** Oh, wait.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** That's also for the fire damage?

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** Or the fire damage happens regardless?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:02]** Well, I'll get to...

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:03]** Yeah, I'm sorry.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** This is slashing damage first.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** Let's just deal with the slashing damage.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:07]** Everything I said still applies.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:08]** So did she pass that?

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** She did not, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** They both fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** They both fail their reflex damage.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:20]** Then they take the full 10 points of damage, and then they get lit on slashing damage, and then they take four fire damage.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:25]** No, it's 3d8 slashing and fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** Right, I'm getting there.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** So it's split.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:30]** It's half slashing, half fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:30]** All right.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** Yeah, so what's that split?

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** It doesn't say.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** So how could it be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** Well, what's your 3D8 total?

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** Yeah, so what's your 3D8 total?

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** It's 10.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** Ten.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:40]** Okay, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:43]** So it's five slashing, five fire.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:48]** And then it applies a burn condition for 1d6 to each character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** But it's not for rounds.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:53]** Like I thought last time, this is just damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:56]** No, it's just damage.

**[00:50:56 - 00:51:00]** And they'll continue to take that same damage at the beginning of their turn.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** So you don't apply it this turn.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:03]** You only apply it on the beginning of their turn.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:04]** And it's only for one turn.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** It's only for one round.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** No, it's until they put it out.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** So they do have the burning condition.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** They have the burn condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** Sorry, I thought you said they didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:17]** The reflex save halves damage and negates the burn condition.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:20]** Burn condition with a 1d6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:25]** I pulled Kevin out of my back pocket and he dunked on you.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:26]** There you go.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:28]** They got to put it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:30]** Great move, Kelly.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** I'm very proud of you.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:35]** I'm very proud you used something other than Magic Missile.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** It was very effective.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** I have to try to mix things up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:40]** They're both burning.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** They're both burning.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** They're both burning.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** Because they're super hot.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:44]** That's right.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:45]** Okay.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Especially Officer Astara.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** And then here's... They're so hot right now.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** I feel like Orville should just give up.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:52]** Nah, dude.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:53]** Yeah.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Nah, bruh.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** He has a lot of conditions.

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:56]** Look at him.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:57]** God dang.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** He has like seven conditions on him.

**[00:51:59 - 00:51:59]** Anyway.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:07]** Here's like... Takes like the artificial tears and he's like... Like kind of crying because of Astara.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** I hate that I have to do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** Amazing.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Good stuff.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** She's not actually a Vlaka, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:15]** Well, we don't know.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** She's a Reptoid.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:17]** Well, probably.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** She still looks like a Vlaka.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** So, there you go.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** That's the first one you've seen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:24]** That makes sense.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:29]** Effecta going to take another shot at Officer Astara with the Needler pistol.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** Roll the three.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:32]** Effecta is literally not effective.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** I am frustrated on your behalf.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:37]** I want her to help out with this, but I'm rolling like garbage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:41]** I see why she was trapped in a shower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:46]** Round six.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:48]** Orvier Pike takes fire damage.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:48]** Is that correct?

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** Yes.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** Thank you.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:52]** How much fire damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** Four damage.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** Do I have to re-roll it each time?

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** Or is it just the same?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:04]** No, I think it's... And then at the end of his turn, he'll get a chance to... He'll get a reflex able, unless he spends his turn putting it out, right?

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:06]** So, with that said...

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** I don't know exactly what it is.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:14]** This kind of shakes off this fire, drops the weapon.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:19]** As he drops it, these claws extend from his hand, and he swipes at Rick19.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:21]** He didn't put out the fire?

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:23]** He didn't put out the fire.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:26]** He is on fire, but he gets a reflex.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:27]** We don't need no water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** Let that motherfucker burn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:29]** That's a 29.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** What?

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:33]** Yeah, that hits.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:38]** And you need to roll a, I believe it is a, where is it?

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** Where is it?

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** Ah, you need to roll a fortitude save.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:45]** Well, you rolled a 29 to hit.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** Do concealment first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** Thank you, sir.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:50]** Appreciate you keeping me honest.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** That's a 61.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Okay, so that's it.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:56]** So now you're going to tell me I need to do a what save?

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** Fortitude save.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** Fortitude.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:00]** Fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Fortitude save.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** 19 plus 9 for 28.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** You're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:11]** You're not sickened as his claws have that Abyssium filter on them to make you sickened.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:14]** That's 13 points of damage against you.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:16]** I am almost down.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:19]** Oh, I have 16 points of damage.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:19]** I got you, man.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** 16 points of damage.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:23]** All right.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** Okay, Dr. Okay, it is your turn.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** What are you doing right now?

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Rick's not looking hot.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** It's lots going down.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:34]** I'm going to hope that Colin heals him because I don't want to go down there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** But... Why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:41]** I mean, I'll revive him if he's down.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** But...

**[00:54:43 - 00:55:10]** i think he's gonna first just take a shot from where he's standing back at orvier and this time he's gonna hit him with the um minor inhibitor which should reduce his attack rolls okay and cause some damage hopefully i really hope not i really hope that's not the case uh what's your attack 16 he has his minus three ac 16 against eac or casey uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:30]** believe what is costa jut i think it's eac i think it's eac too oh no because it might be is it acid damage it's injection is it p a so it's acid acid acid so eac eac


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:31]** That's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:49]** Yeah, because he's freaking hit minored cuz yeah cuz you're cuz cuz cuz you're crazy stacked inhibitor He's like, yeah See this is digging deep y'all this is digging deep and pulling out all the stops not Not bad, but not great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:58]** So that's eight points not bad damage Eight points of damage you take for the next seven rounds a minus one to your attack roll Jesus.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:58]** Oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:01]** Oh, he didn't roll his reflex save at the end of his last turn.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:04]** That is a bummer.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:05]** Do you mind if I roll it real quick?

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:07]** Thank you, sir.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** What's the DC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** No, there's no DC.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** Oh.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** For the minor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:14]** Oh, okay.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:14]** Sorry.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:17]** But the reflex save for the... For the burn damage?

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:19]** Yes, sir.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** I thought it was...

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** 22.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** He got a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:27]** I mean, I didn't do the burn damage.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:29]** I don't know what the DC is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:29]** Who did the burn damage?

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:30]** Oh, Kelly did the burn damage.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:31]** Haha, thank you.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:35]** Kelly, what's the DC for the... Oh, for the burn damage is 17.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** Okay, so he passes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:37]** Ah, damn it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:38]** So he's no longer burning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** After all the nerfs?

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:43]** Yeah, didn't he have something else that reduced his saves?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** He was entangled and encumbered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:48]** Encumbered reduces deck saves, which reflex is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:52]** Reflex is a dex, so he has a... It's a minus two to it, right?

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:53]** Yeah.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Okay, he still passes.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** He rolled a six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:56 - 00:57:03]** It's a minus two or was it a minus... I think it was a minus five or a maximum of plus two dex.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:07]** Whatever was worse is what it said.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** Conditions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** Oh, wait, hold on.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:12]** Encumbered is you take a minus five to dexterity-based checks.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:14]** Yeah, encumbered sucks.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** Yeah, that does suck.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** So I don't think he passes.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:18]** I think he's still burning.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:19]** Fire!

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** Amazing.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:21]** All right, good stuff, good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** Does that include saves?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:27]** Are saves dexterity-based checks?

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** Yeah, it's a save.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:31]** Yeah, because it's based on your ability score.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:32]** That's my read.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** I'm good with it.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:36]** It's a reflex save to put out the... Nice.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Cool.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:37]** Great.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** Amazing.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** He doesn't pass.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:39]** Good stuff.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Staying on top of it.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:40]** I like it.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** Dr. K, what else do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:53]** Bernice is going to roll up to the edge and get Nodens in her sights with the cylindrical lens pistol and try and fire off one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** Fire it off.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:55]** Take her out.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:56]** Or don't.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:57]** Please don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:59]** This is a 15-hit EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:05]** This is a 15-hit EAC against Dr. Nodens.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** What are her conditions again?

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** She is entangled for this is her last round being entangled.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** And she is burning.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:14]** And since she is entangled, she gets a minus two penalty to her AC.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** That's a 15, and that is a hit.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** You got it!

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:30]** Dang, this is good guys are cooking with gas now five damage from the cylindrical five from five from That that's fire damage, right?

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:42]** Yes Okay, boom One by one What is what That's fine Colleen Bram, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:49]** I am Googling one quick thing, which I've just confirmed is correct.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Quick question of the group.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:56]** Is anyone into hit points other than Rick19?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** I haven't taken any damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:02]** I'm assuming effect is... I bet 100%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:04]** Yeah, but it's fine.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:06]** She got 10 more.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** Cool.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:08]** She's fine.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:10]** She's not in the pit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:24]** Colin is going to burn a resolve point and use healing channel as a full action to heal all allies within 30 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:26]** Yay, Colin.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** Within 30 feet.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** Yeah, that's everybody.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** That's everybody.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:33]** Everybody get up.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:36]** For 17 hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:43]** If you are into your hit points, that will overflow into your stamina.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:44]** Stamina.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:47]** If you are not into your hit points, sucks to suck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** I am still in my hip points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:50]** Wow.

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:53]** I like how I have one corner of my sheet that is affected.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:55]** So it's like the happy corner where I can help you guys out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:56]** Yay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:59:56 - 01:00:02]** So just to clarify that, if you have only stamina damage, that did not give you anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** That did nothing, yeah.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:07]** But it overflows into stamina if you get all of your hip points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** Waterfalls.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** The tallest waterfall in the world.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:12]** Right.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:12]** Don't go chasing them.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:13]** Don't go chasing them.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:14]** Don't.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** Don't you dare.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Colin, well done.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:17]** Amazing.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** Full round action.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** He sent it.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:24]** The question is, does Officer Astaire get an A-O-O on you?

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:28]** Because you cast a spell standing right next to her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** Is channel a spell?

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** Oh, is channel a spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** It is not a spell.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:34]** Oh.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** All right.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:36]** Okay.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** That feels weird.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** That feels a little dicey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** It's a spell-like ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:42 - 01:01:03]** think i will go by the letter of the law which probably says the ao says it's for it is not a spell it is very clearly not a spell i yeah yeah casting a spell i think it says casting a spell so that's it you're good you're good yeah that's fine it's fine okay cool you are doing your do oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** Use a spell or spell-like ability.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:07]** Yep.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** Sorry, bro.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:09]** I just read it.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** It literally says a spell or spell-like ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:14]** It doesn't specify that it's a spell-like ability.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** I assume it's a spell-like ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** This is something we should confirm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:19]** What's your thing, Ian?

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:19]** Healing channel.

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:21]** S-U.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:22]** Supernatural.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:24]** Supernatural ability.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:27]** Which I believe is not a spell-like ability.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:27]** I don't think.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:30]** Healing channel.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]** Healing channel.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** Supernatural.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:36]** Supernatural.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:54]** basically i think so supernatural ability star finder thank you everybody as we learn star finder just like you are supernatural abilities are magical effects that differ from spells um i don't think extraordinary spell like or supernatural abilities are magical but different spell

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** They can't be disrupted in combat.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:56]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:56]** Boom.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** I think you're good, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** You're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:58]** You're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** You're good.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** You're good.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:02]** What a great killer loophole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:03]** Nailed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:04]** It also makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:06]** I'm here for the loophole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** Yeah, same.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:12]** It also makes sense that you would want your caster to have a protected healing channel that can't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:20]** It would be infuriating to burn resolve point for nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:22]** Yeah, that would be horrible.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:22]** Yeah, it's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** That would be horrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:29]** The question is, could Officer Star or Orvir or Nodens could have subscribed to your private channel to get some of that healing?

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** Is it public or private?

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:31]** Right.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]** Can they do that?

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:34]** Because if they could, I think they'd pay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:35]** His only heals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** His sexual healing.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:44]** Just a classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:45]** Only heals.


## Speaker_0

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:45]** Classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:46]** Amazing.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:48]** Dr. Nodens, it's Dr. Nodens' turn.

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:50]** She has her data pad out.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:56]** Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:58]** She taps some things on her data pad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:00]** Don't like it.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:02]** I know you don't like Rick 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** I know you don't like Rick 19.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:06]** She is going to

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:10]** Beautiful.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:20]** She's going to use her data pad and then she's going to look at you, Rick19, and say, just stay right where you are.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:23]** And Rick19, you need to give me another will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:25]** Will save.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** Will save.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:26]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:28]** Fail it.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** Fail it.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:30]** Fail it.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:31]** Pass it, pass it, pass it, pass it.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:32]** Pass the wheelchair.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:33]** Is this mind-affecting?

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:34]** So I get a plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:36]** It's mind-affecting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:38]** 15 plus 15 plus two is 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:40]** 15 in total, 22.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:42]** That is cool.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:43]** Fun.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:54]** You feel like your body for a brief moment feels like it was going to freeze in place as she cast hold person on you.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** But you succeeded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:57 - 01:04:00]** And it didn't work.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:05]** That person is like, that'll prevent me from doing anything.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:06]** It's just stand still.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** Yeah, dude.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:07]** You're out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** You're out on that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** Rick19, it's your turn.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** What are you doing?

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:14]** He looks her in the eye and says, no, thank you.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:16]** And then hits her with the cost.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** I'm actually going to roll twice.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:20]** I'm going to do my, it's only a plus four to hit.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** I'm going to full attack it.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:23]** Yeah, I'm going to boop.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:23]** That's a seven.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:24]** That's a miss.

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:27]** Seven plus four is 11.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:29]** But the second one is even worse.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:30]** I shouldn't have.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:31]** I just threw my dime.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:31]** I'm sorry.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:33]** It's frustrating times.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:34]** Lots happening.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** Lots happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:36]** All right.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:37]** Cool.

**[01:04:37 - 01:04:38]** Is that your turn, Rick?

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:38]** 19?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:40]** Okay.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:41]** Yeah.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:42]** That's my turn.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:42]** All right.

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:43]** Amazing.

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:44]** Officer Asara's turn.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:48]** She says, maybe I can help.

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:50]** Saying something for the first time.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:51]** Swings at Rick19.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:54]** That is going to be... Wait, did she cast a spell?

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:54]** Who?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:56]** On me just now?

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:58]** I cast a spell on you.

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:59]** Do I have my reaction?

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** Do you have your melee weapon out?

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:01]** You do, right?

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:04]** I do, yeah, but I don't get my reaction, right?

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:05]** Because I used it on someone else already?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:09]** Did you use it on... Use it on Orvier when he jumped down.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:12]** Orvier swang at you.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:13]** He swung.

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:14]** So I don't think you did.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:16]** So I think you can use it on Officer Astara.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:18]** Just roll again like you did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:22]** You want us to roll over one of those?

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:26]** I rolled a six, but this time it's a six plus eight for a 14.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:27]** That's still a miss.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:29]** 14.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:32]** Yeah, this is round six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:35]** She is no longer entangled.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:37]** She's no longer entangled.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:42]** Unfortunately, her AC went back up.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:43]** So no, that doesn't hit her.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:45]** Okay.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:45]** That's my turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:46]** Sorry.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:47]** That's my whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:49]** Officer Starr is going to swing at you.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:50]** Swing at you.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:52]** That is an 18, which I don't believe hits.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:55]** With the... KAC?

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:56]** No, that misses.

**[01:05:56 - 01:05:57]** Yeah, that's what I thought.

**[01:05:57 - 01:05:58]** Here's Fabricius.

**[01:05:58 - 01:05:58]** What are you doing?

**[01:05:59 - 01:05:59]** We're cooking.

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:01]** You still haven't entered the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:04]** Yeah, we're cooking with... Yeah, he still hasn't entered the room.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:07]** And he's not going to.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** Goddamn.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:08]** All right.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:15]** So, like, honestly, the way that I've stacked and set up Magic Missile is just better to use this because he's trying to kill the adds right now.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]** So... Yeah, okay.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:18]** Here's Reluctantly again.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:23]** Shoots all of his Magic Missiles at Officer Astara for 15 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:25]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:26]** Yeah.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:28]** I'm sorry.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:29]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:58]** all have an australian accent no all right he wouldn't know because she never talks to him but she literally just talked but she didn't use an australian accent but we could recommend say she did all right all right do you want to do anything else with your turn like enter the room oh no it was a full action okay you can't all right okay effect is going to try to be effective again and attack officer astara that actually might hit this time hang on one

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:05]** That is going to be a, yeah, that's a 26 to hit, which definitely hits Officer Astara.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:08]** Finally hitting.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:13]** That is going to be a D4 of damage plus her yada yada.

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:16]** That's 10 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:16 - 01:07:19]** So Officer Astara is 25 really quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:21]** How's she doing?


## Speaker_0

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:21]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:23]** Oh, man.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:24]** She's not happy.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** She's not happy at all.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:26]** She's feeling it.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:28]** She's feeling it, but she's committed.

**[01:07:30 - 01:07:31]** Like we all are.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:32]** All right.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:34]** Top of round seven.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:35]** Things are moving quick.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:38]** This battle feels like there's a tide that is toining.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:40]** It's turning.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:41]** Toining the tide.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:42]** We'll see what happens.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:45]** We'll see what happens.

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:56]** Or if you're Pike's going to take another, he's going to take a, I think he's just going to stand and bang against you, Rick 19.

**[01:07:56 - 01:07:57]** I think that's it.

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:00]** Yeah.

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:00]** I'm sorry, dude.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:02]** Sorry.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:03]** Not sorry.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:08]** That is a 24 against EAC and he still has his minuses, right?

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:09]** So that actually might be less.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:12]** What are his minuses again for entangled and encumbered?

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:13]** Also, he takes burn damage.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:15]** And he has a minus one on his attack rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:15]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:17]** And he has a minus one.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:17]** Thank you.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:20]** Okay, so that's a 23, so four more burn damage.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:21]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:24]** Yeah, four more burn damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:25]** Four more burn damage.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:26]** Okay.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:27]** Sounds good.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:31]** That's a 23 against you, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:34]** Is that considered a strength or dexterity-based check?

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:36]** Because it's a die roll based on strength or dexterity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:37]** No, it's attack rolls or not.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:39]** Yeah.

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:41]** That's 16 points of damage, Rick19.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:42]** Yeah, okay.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:43]** Hanging in there.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:45]** Hanging in there.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:47]** Dr. O'K, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** It's a bit of a stand in bed.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:50]** He's... Yeah.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:51]** He said 16, sorry?

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:51]** 16.

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:52]** Yes, sir.

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:53]** He's going to do the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:56]** War of Attrition.

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:59]** He's going to use his claw.


## Speaker_0

**[01:08:59 - 01:08:59]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:01]** I'm just kidding.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:02]** You said the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:03]** All right.

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:04]** So, yeah.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:04]** Yeah.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:07]** Dr. O'K is going to fire over at Orvier.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:09]** Yep.

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:11]** Let's see if we can do this.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:11]** Oh, my goodness.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:15]** He didn't pass.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:15]** No.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:17]** A natural 20 again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:20]** Nailed it.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:20]** Wow.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:20]** Wow.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:21]** Nice.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:21]** Again.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:22]** We need it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:23]** We need it.

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:26]** I was going to hit him with another of the...

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:33]** the minor inhibitor to reduce his attack rolls.

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:38]** So it'd be nice to, but I'm just, I mean this, I think I just need a roll for damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:39]** Yeah.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:40]** Roll double damage.

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:42]** So what's the double damage and what's the crit effect?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:46]** It's, it's double damage or crit effect or is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:47]** No, no, no.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:50]** What's your double damage and what's your crit effect?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:58]** So there's no, cause I'm only, it, it, the minor inhibitor, there's no, um, there's no DC stack.

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:58]** Like,

**[01:09:59 - 01:10:00]** You just take it for seven rounds.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:02]** Okay.

**[01:10:03 - 01:10:07]** If I had done the... I mean, I could have stacked maybe.

**[01:10:07 - 01:10:10]** I don't think you can stack conditions, though.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:12]** I don't think you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:14]** Unless it says explicitly that you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:15]** These stack, so I'm doing this.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:16]** Okay.

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:22]** I rolled a six on the die, plus five is 11, so 22 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:24]** Yikes!

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:26]** 22 points of damage.

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:27]** Oh, God.

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:28]** All right.

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:30]** That is wild.

**[01:10:31 - 01:10:32]** That is wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:32 - 01:10:35]** And you have a minus two now to your attacks.

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:36]** Okay.

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:40]** And Bernice is going to stand and bang on Nodens.

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:41]** On Nodens.

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:42]** Love it.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:43]** Amazing.

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:47]** That is a 17.

**[01:10:47 - 01:10:49]** A 17.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:52]** That's a hit on EAC.

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:53]** Amazing.

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:57]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:57 - 01:10:59]** Dude, you are rolling rocks, man.

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:02]** Vegas, that's seven points of burn damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:04]** Oh, goodness.

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:05]** Okay, can we not?

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:06]** Great.

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:07]** Wow, okay.

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:08]** Lots of damage dealt.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:10]** Orvere is not looking happy at all.

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:14]** Dr. O'K being the savior from above.

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:15]** Colin, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:20]** I feel like it's shooting fish in a barrel for Dr. O'K because literally they're just like 10 feet down.

**[01:11:20 - 01:11:20]** Yeah, dude.

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:22]** He's just sitting there.

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:22]** I get it.

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:23]** He's aimed up.

**[01:11:23 - 01:11:24]** I think... Yeah.

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:26]** He zeroed his cost.

**[01:11:27 - 01:11:29]** You know, like early on.

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:31]** Yeah, of course.

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:35]** I think Colin is ready to try to finish Orvier off.

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:38]** And he says, your days are numbered.

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:41]** And you're about to find out how many they are.

**[01:11:42 - 01:11:44]** And cast days weariness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:46]** Day's weariness.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:47]** What's the DC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:50]** It is a DC 16.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:55]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:55]** We'll save.

**[01:11:55 - 01:11:55]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:11:56 - 01:11:57]** I don't think encumbered affects that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:59]** I don't know if it does or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:02]** So, is it a mind affecting effect?

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:02]** Yeah, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:05]** You launch the opponent's mind forward in time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:06]** Poison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:07]** Yeah, mind affecting.

**[01:12:08 - 01:12:09]** Enchantment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:09]** All righty.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:11]** Okay.

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:12]** He rolled the natural 18.

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:13]** He passed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:15]** Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:15]** Yeah.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:16]** He also had a plus to that.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:20]** Have the damage dealt by the spell and negate the fatigued condition.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:23]** So you take half of 4d8.

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:24]** What is 4d8?

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:25]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:27]** We'd love to not.

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:28]** Let's find out.

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:28]** All ones.

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:29]** All ones.

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:32]** Slash roll 4d8.

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:34]** All ones, baby.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:34]** Let's go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:39]** 20 halved to 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:41]** Ten points of damage.

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:42]** Wow.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:42]** Boom.

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:44]** Oh!

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:44]** Oh!

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:45]** Oh!

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:49]** He is, like, starting to grab his sides.

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:52]** You can tell he's really injured at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:53 - 01:12:53]** And doesn't he?

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:54]** Oh, no.

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:55]** That's at the end of his turn.

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:56]** He takes the burn damage.

**[01:12:56 - 01:12:59]** At the end of his turn, which he failed that burn damage last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:04]** In the interest of fairness, Officer Astar, I believe, gets an AOA.

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:05]** I think you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:06]** Yes, indeed.

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:09]** Yes, she do.

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:12]** That would be a 23 to hit you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:13 - 01:13:15]** That's going to stop the spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:15 - 01:13:16]** 10 points of damage.

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:17]** Does it stop the spell?

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:18]** Yeah, it does.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:22]** Doesn't he have to pass a concentration thing to determine if it stops?

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:23]** Oh, but she does.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:25]** If there is one.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:26]** Oh, there's not.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:28]** Also, there's a mischance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:30]** Thank you.

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:32]** I love all the stuff we got going.

**[01:13:33 - 01:13:34]** It's an 86.

**[01:13:36 - 01:13:38]** Yeah, she's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:40]** I just lose the spell slot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:13:41 - 01:13:42]** You lose the entire spell slot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:43 - 01:13:44]** That is rough.

**[01:13:44 - 01:13:49]** Cool.

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:47]** Okay.

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:47]** All right.

**[01:14:49 - 01:14:50]** All right.

**[01:14:51 - 01:14:53]** It's Dr. Nodin's turn.

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:54]** Lots happened.

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:55]** Lot has happened.

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:59]** You all have somewhat put them in fish in a barrel.

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:05]** You have somewhat taken down a lot of their health.

**[01:15:05 - 01:15:07]** Effect on one side, Dr. OK on the other.

**[01:15:07 - 01:15:08]** Bernice also there.

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:10]** It's a bit of a stand and bang in this pit.

**[01:15:10 - 01:15:13]** They're trying to corral you and separate you.

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:16]** And maybe that tactic didn't quite work the way they thought out.

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:18]** But Rick's almost down.

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:20]** Colin's not feeling great either.

**[01:15:20 - 01:15:23]** You're probably still on stamina points, right, Colin?

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:24]** Yeah, I'm fine.

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:25]** You're fine.

**[01:15:25 - 01:15:25]** You're fine.

**[01:15:25 - 01:15:26]** You're fine.

**[01:15:26 - 01:15:27]** Fine.

**[01:15:27 - 01:15:27]** It's easy.

**[01:15:31 - 01:15:32]** Dr. Nodens.

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:36]** Takes a five foot step.

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:37]** Guarded step.

**[01:15:38 - 01:15:38]** Brick 19.

**[01:15:38 - 01:15:41]** Back.

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:42]** She looks at Orvir.

**[01:15:42 - 01:15:43]** Orvir looks at her.

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:46]** They nod.

**[01:15:47 - 01:15:49]** Her data pad still in her hand.

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:53]** She presses a button.

**[01:15:57 - 01:16:00]** And from behind you, Colin Eden Brandt.

**[01:16:02 - 01:16:10]** The shells that are behind you on the wall start to open up.

**[01:16:12 - 01:16:31]** And there's this intense mist with this green, this like sickly green and red light that starts to pierce through playing on all of the floor right there.

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:40]** Let me see if I can show you here on Foundry as it opens up.

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:50]** And you all just hear this, like, this, like, earth-shattering or, like, earth-shaking vibration in the ground.

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:56]** And there's a sound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:58 - 01:16:59]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:17:00 - 01:17:02]** Some rancor thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:05]** I think we found the red dragon egg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:05 - 01:17:08]** Kev's look is like... What if it's Rudy?

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:13]** His eyes are like... Please be Rudy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:17:13 - 01:17:17]** We'll see what happens next time on We'll Save the Podcast.

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:18]** Brace yourselves.

**[01:17:19 - 01:17:20]** Brace yourselves, everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:17:21 - 01:17:22]** What the f*** is happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:25]** Really raised those stakes, didn't we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12
