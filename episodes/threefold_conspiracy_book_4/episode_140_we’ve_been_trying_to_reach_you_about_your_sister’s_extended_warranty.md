**[00:01:29 - 00:01:31]** Yeah, Kelly, there it was.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:31]** I love that.

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:32]** I did love that.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** It was so good.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** Really appreciate that.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:34]** You're welcome.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** You're awesome.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:47]** I am your hot and humid GM joined by my fellow beautiful Dewey in their lane, refreshed castmates, Will, Kelly, Kevin, and Benny.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** Looking good, as always.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:51]** We're moisturized today.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** Thank you.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:54]** You are moisturized and looking great.

**[00:01:55 - 00:02:04]** And it's always a pleasure, always, to be here recording another episode with y'all as I butts around with my timer and try and find... There it is.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:07]** I was waiting for the graphic to come up so I could start my timer.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:08]** Sick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:31]** uh so what's going on with you guys what's up what's nothing much cool uh i i discovered a new beer um it's not really a new beer but it's new to me um i love delirium's trimmings and they also had a delirium i think noir or some nocturne yeah um but the new one's just delirium red and um

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** I love it.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:34]** It tastes like fruit punch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:36]** Yeah.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** That's great.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** That's dangerous.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:41]** And it's like 9.8% alcohol or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** As any good Belgian should be.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** It was really good.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** So I joined Axe League again.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:51]** So every Wednesday night I go and throw axes at a wall while I drink beer.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:52]** Nice.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:56]** And we went out to the bar afterwards and I saw that on the menu and I was like,

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** I just saw Delirium and Red.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:02]** That didn't comprehend to me, but I was like, it's from Delirium, so I'll take it.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** And it was really good.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:04]** I recommend it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:07]** It's definitely like Gatorade Red.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** Oh, it's like Gatorade Red.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** It's like a cherry tart.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** The foam, it's actually like a pinkish foam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** It looks like a Franbois.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** Yeah, it's very good.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:18]** A Franbois.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:21]** Mildly sour cherries with hints of almond.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** That sounds great.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** I get behind that.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:30]** Just don't drink too much of it because my hangover the next day was... It's only 8% though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** I thought it was 9%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:35]** It's still better than an American beer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:40]** Oh no, my Victory Monkeys are always 9 point something.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** This is 9.5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:44]** And I had three of these before drinking one of those.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:48]** Victory is like that'll put you on your...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** Every single beer they have is like 9%.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** You know what?

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** Why make less than 9% beer?

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** You know, just make good heavy hitter beer.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:02]** I mean, there are plenty of reasons to not make 9%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:07]** I mean, if you have to be in Philly, then I guess you're going to drink hella strong beer because you're in Philly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** You're in Philly.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Is victory Philly beer?

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:14]** I'll be in Philly just because Philly people are Philly people.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Victory Brewer is in Philly.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:21]** Trust Kelly to blame it on the people and not the actual product.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** I was in Philly for things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:26]** I saw it also the day they lost the Super Bowl a couple years ago.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** It was something else.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** You made it out with your life.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** Beer and Philly people don't mix.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** Or they do, but it's not a good thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:56]** they mix too well uh well speaking of memories i i have a question for you guys as as we're getting to a part of uh threefold book three where you know book three things are book three and you know what i'm saying and uh how many books are in this will's like man i don't know how much more i can take um there are six books in threefold conspiracy


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:06]** oh yeah so presumably we're through a one and one third of a fold one and one third yeah maybe who knows maybe who knows


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:29]** question what what will save scene from any like moment on any show that we've had would you play again like play as in play like like like no no no no just like just like go back to and be in that moment again second car you know second cargo bay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:31]** Oh, the beginning of that whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:38]** Of, like, we'll say even the interstellar tales of the intergalactic.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:42]** Like, how expansive is this assessment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** Any show that we've ever done.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** Anything that we've ever done.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:49]** So, you're saying the second Cargo Bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** I was just pointing that out.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** Oh, okay.

**[00:05:54 - 00:06:12]** gosh that's a tough question to answer um yeah i mean we have we have done a lot so i wanted to ask just wanted to check in finale of uh interstellar extra galactic i forget the name um yes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:15]** Interstellar Tales from the Extra Galactic Adventure Anthology?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:16]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:17]** Nailed it.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:21]** I'll put our voices in for you, Will, at that moment.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** It'll jump back and forth between the two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** That was a lot of fun.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** That was a lot of fun.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:39]** I would hope that everything would go the same way because I really enjoyed that, but

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:47]** It was a good ending to a little one-shot that was 54 episodes.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:47]** 53?

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** A little in quotes.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** Yeah.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:50]** Yeah.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:52]** 53 episode one-shot?

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:52]** Not bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:59]** I would go back and play Chak the Raxalite at almost any point.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:05]** We had so much fun in Junkers that I have a hard time nailing down.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:08]** I think the message from Triune was a really special moment.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** That was a very special moment.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** It's so silly that it almost worked.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:21]** But also that heartfelt conversation that Chak had with Thaddeus

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:25]** As they're like about to part ways indefinitely.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** Like that.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** I don't know.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** It's just like that.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:36]** The landing of that plane was so satisfying that like, I wish I could do it again for the first time.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** I agree.

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:41]** But also like, I would probably it up if I was to do it again.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:43]** So maybe not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** I think of that moment, the moment I call like Shaq's mistake.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:50]** That's like how I think about it or what I sort of coined it as.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** But like, I feel like that was like a really good moment.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:56]** Shaq's mistake because because of his choice.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:57]** He made the wrong choice.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:04]** But but then Kelly is still die hard by CFC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** I really like that.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:10]** I have similar answers to them, but I'll choose to think from 3FC because it's also quite fun.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:13]** I really like the Frog battle.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:20]** I feel like we had a good unifying moment there and I thought that Frog was a cool...

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** Oh, wait, no, no, not the frog battle.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** Wait, is it frog?

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** When frog was on our side, that's what I mean.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** When he was fighting us.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:29]** That was my favorite moment.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** Quantum troll.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** Quantum troll, yeah.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** Exactly.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:32]** That's what it was.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** Yeah, that was, yeah.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** That was a good moment for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** Yeah, that was really good.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** Yeah, I think...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:42]** This might have been before Vinny, though.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** Or I might be misremembering anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** No, Vinny came right after Frog was introduced.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:53]** That was, yeah, that was literally like an episode or two right before Frog.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** Y'all won in the bushes.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:57]** I think that's the name of that.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** Yes, yes.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** Good memory, Will.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** Wait, wait.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** Without looking, what episode number was that?

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:06]** Shoot.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** I want to say like

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** 62?

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:12]** I'm gonna say 64.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:14]** You're gonna say 64?

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** Okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** Let's see if we can guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** I feel like it was 62.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:20]** Oh, you were right.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:20]** John.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:21]** It's 62.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** Woo.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** Nailed it.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:26]** That was it.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:28]** That was complete guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** The consummate GM that is John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:39]** I don't even have a, well, I do have a spreadsheet, but it's a, it's more like a spread folder and it's not even as cool as yours will.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:40]** Cause I know you use a obsidian, right?

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:42]** For notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:45]** Yeah, I've been using Obsidian a little bit.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Nice.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** Kev, what about you?

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** What's your memory?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** Man, I was thinking on this.

**[00:09:52 - 00:10:04]** The book one really had me going, and I think that rush towards the end, I know, Will, you said the other cargo bay, but it's actually the runaway sequence after that as the ship's exploding.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** I think that was a really powerful scene.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:07]** That was cool.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:10]** And then, of course, the outcome from that was...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** The outcome was not cool, yeah.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** Yeah, I think the moment where everyone, like, dropped.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:18]** Basically, that was a cool moment, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:21]** They just, like, froze up and fell over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** Creepy.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:26]** Al, Giada's eyes, like, rolled back in the back of her head.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** Oh yeah, and Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:32]** Rick was like, it wasn't me, it wasn't me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:32]** It wasn't me!

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:32]** I didn't do it!

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** I didn't shoot, I swear I didn't shoot!

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** Yeah, that's funny.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:38]** Yeah, I think that's mine, but also the end of Unknown Treasures was great.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:42]** I feel like I have one from each book.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:51]** Book one was definitely that whole last episode, just you four running through, trying to escape, right as it happens, and you're running out.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:55]** Book two, where we find Colin leading into...

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:58]** Frog, that's like just a great moment.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** I'm trying to think what else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:04]** My honorable mention would be Starship Combat.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:09]** when we were kind of working together as a team to fight the greatest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** That was a fun chess match, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** Book three, yeah.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** Book three, Starship combat.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:14]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** Yeah, I agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:15]** Some good moments.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** I like the nano adventure.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:23]** Just like in general, there was a fun vibe to like step away from it and come back to that.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:28]** And then the episode right after that where Dr. Nodens...

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** Ask you questions.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** 20 questions.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:30]** Oh, that.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:31]** No.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:34]** That is not my favorite part of the memory.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:36]** That was terrible, John.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** That was a good time.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:38]** It's a good time.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** Well.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** We should get playing.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** It's about that time.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** But first, I think we have a shout-out.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:50]** Kelly, you want to hit him with a shout-out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:51]** Secret shout-out.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:54]** This is for you, guy that I'm not allowed to say.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** ASMR.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:58]** He's been DMing me on Discord.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:01]** And you know who you are from talking to you.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** But this young man, he's in love.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** He's in love with an older woman.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:08]** And it's like...

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** He's going through some stuff there.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:10]** I know.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** He's learning a lot of things, you know what I mean?

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** Can you set it up?

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** How much older?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** Yeah, how much older?

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** My wife's an older woman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** No, no.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:17]** Only by a year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:19]** Are you allowed to share this?

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:19]** Are these?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** Yeah, I'm allowed.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** I'm just not going to say who it is.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** Okay, all right.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:27]** It's old enough where it's one of those like, huh, like kind of things.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:32]** But I just want you to just relax and go with the flow, man.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** And everything's going to be okay.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** Just learn, man.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** Learn and explore.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** Yeah.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Learn and explore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** Yeah, good luck with that.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:39]** Be careful with older women.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** Send it.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** Yeah, send it.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:43]** You have all of it.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** We'll save.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** behind you.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:47]** Listen to this episode right before you go see them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:49]** I look forward to meeting them.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:49]** Both of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:55]** Turn it up when you have sexy time with them.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** Turn up episode 140.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:59]** This is your favorite moment and we'll save.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:07]** Also to all you listeners, if you do have a favorite moment that you want to share, throw it in the Discord.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:10]** Throw it in the relevant channel when you hear this.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** Let us know what you think.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Also want to shout out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:20]** When you say relevant channel, if it's book one memory, do they have to go back to the book one channel?

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:23]** There's been a lot of confusion with that lately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:28]** But Kelly's cleared it up.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:33]** Like the Discord keeper that he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:33]** Well, I don't know.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:38]** The dragon incident is all over warnings and spoilers regular channel.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** So I'm not really sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:44]** Right, but warnings and spoilers shouldn't be in its own channel now because you have each of the other books.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** I know, but I can't bring myself to delete it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:52]** I guess we need to put like... Benny has his hand raised and then we'll hear that comment and then we'll keep going.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** What's happening?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:56]** I want to say, one, we hear you, audience.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Not a great moment for us.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:05]** Two, I don't think we've ever been slapped on the wrist like we have for the dragon incident.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:05]** Ever.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:08]** The dragon incident is like, god dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:11]** Every GM on our Discord was like, what the heck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:14]** We should explain what happened.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:19]** They were basically like, you guys are being really disrespectful to Jon's moment by talking over the dragon.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:24]** This is a cool dragon moment, and here we are like, what's the word I'm looking for?

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** We were just like, this dragon the entire time.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:29]** Yeah, because we're being irreverent towards it.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:33]** Which we do a lot, but then the dragon is too far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** I've been thinking hard on that, though.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:38]** Honestly, I don't think...

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:44]** I think in the situation, our characters actually did feel that way of like, and we're just trying to get off this planet.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:47]** We're finally making some progress.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** And what the hell?

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** Oh, this dragon doesn't want to fight us?

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:51]** Okay, what do you want then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:52]** Just tell us what you want.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:52]** We'll go.

**[00:14:53 - 00:15:00]** And from an outside perspective, I feel like if a red dragon just dropped in front of the five of us on the street, we would have done exactly the same thing.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:03]** Vinny, Kev, Will, and Kelly and John would have done that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** Keep that in mind.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** That's fine.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** That's good.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:11]** If you wouldn't have insulted the dragon, you would have been wise.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** You would have been like, nah, I'm not going to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** No, I'm saying I would have played it exactly how Colin did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** Exactly, exactly.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:18]** He would have thrown out a Scottish accent.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:22]** Yeah, just randomly gotten a Scottish accent.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** Who the f*** are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** We would have died in real life, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:28]** Yeah, you would have died in real life.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:32]** There are plenty of reasons why you didn't die or why certain things weren't done.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:33]** Because she needs us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** Plot armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** We're useful to her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:37]** We need to go forward in the story.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** She clearly can't do it herself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:41]** That's true.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:45]** She was like, I only fit through the hangar door and it's locked.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:48]** That's literally what she told us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** I'm not going to say anything else.

**[00:15:50 - 00:16:00]** I think it's maybe a bit foolish to think that a red dragon, an evil red dragon, would just come to you and be like, hey, what's up?

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** Yep, I'm just going to ask for some help.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** And it's cool.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:05]** And it's fine.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:08]** And the thing is, you all weren't really, like, you all were talking over it.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:13]** But, like, I couldn't tell if your characters were, which is why I was like, well, I don't, you know.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** I probably should have asked.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** So are your characters cheesing or are y'all just cheesing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** We were definitely cheesing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:21]** Well, yeah, the players were.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** I don't know if the characters were.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** But that being said, we do hear you.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:33]** And I think it's important that we, as much as we love humor, I think it was important that we treat moments with respect and depart from humor and then come back.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:37]** That's the thing is that I think it's possible to strike a balance between the two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:56]** we appreciate the candor of our community yes yeah and we do we do respect your love positive and negative feedback yeah who was it crow t that said um when you when you said uh yes rick do you have a question or something yeah yeah yeah dragon's voice we break that like that was a great moment


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** We also break that.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** Like, that's totally fine.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:01]** I just think you want to respect everybody having fun and the work that people put in.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:08]** Because I think, like I mentioned, maybe privately, it's like, if you all were having a moment, you wouldn't want me to step on your moment, right?

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:13]** Like, if you were trying to have a serious moment, you wouldn't want me to be, like, clown over the whole thing, you know?

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** I think it was fun for us.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:18]** I'm sorry if it broke the reality for anybody listening.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:24]** And we'll try to put a little more weight into those scenarios next time.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:25]** Yeah.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:34]** With that said... I was half expecting Donkey... Here's our Colin to go Donkey on it and try to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:42]** I also want to say as a quick, hey, I prepped for literally everything except for the one thing that I showed them, which is how to raise the stakes.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:57]** So one thing is I do want to shout out Syrinscape, our partner who helped bring the dragon to life with the dragon effects and brings out literally most of our music to life and the whole sonic landscape that you are hearing.

**[00:17:59 - 00:17:59]** Let's play.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** Let's get into it.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:30]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Or punishment.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:32]** Or punishment.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:37]** You know, it used to be a Reptoid, and now no longer was one.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:39]** If it was Thaddeus, he'd try to cook them up.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** It's like a familiar.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:41]** I would.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** Yeah, it's weird.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:44]** I don't think Thaddeus has ever cooked a Reptoid before.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** Well, no, he doesn't know they exist.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:49]** Not yet.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:49]** Just wait.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** You make your way inside.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** The Brutalist.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:56]** Base in the middle of Varos.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:58]** The desolate landscape.

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:01]** You make your way inside where the air is...

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:09]** Sticky, hot, humid, immediately just leaves condensation on the inside.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:18]** If you're wearing like a helmet or glasses, you feel like you are just walking and there's a slight wet sound that's not Dr. Okay, just moving.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** It's the floor.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:25]** It's like the puddle of condensation that sits everywhere.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:33]** And inside this L-shaped hallway, you begin exploring a room of empty beds and some storage.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:43]** You find several medical paraphernalia, including some different things, some items that you can keep.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:50]** This room is pretty sparse, pretty utilitarian, including these accessories for a device that, Dr.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** O.K., you're like, this is...

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:59]** This is a device that can penetrate someone's mind.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:08]** Can scour their mind like a looking glass for information, memories.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:15]** And then you discover a chest with these names on them.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:20]** One of the names is Taj Loner.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:23]** One of the names is

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:36]** effecta and then another name is Cora Eden brand.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:47]** And I want you all to close your eyes and then begin to picture

**[00:20:48 - 00:21:05]** an open scene on the inside of an empty, plain wooden box, partially lit by one piercing ray of afternoon sun coming from a window.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:10]** Dust, little motes float through that light.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:15]** This box has been untouched for many, many years.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:24]** We pull back and see that the box is tucked away deep in the corner of a big drawer.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:36]** And we keep moving the camera back and see a large, well-appointed room start to come in on the edges as you zoom out slowly.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:42]** And you realize that this room feels stagnant, unused.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:53]** In front of you next to that dresser is a bed, still made with nice light purple and yellow sheets.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:58]** You pull back further and see a table on the far side of the room.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:06]** But the side of the bed, the side of the room with the bed, untouched, holding on to many years of its previous owner.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:10]** But there are more years empty now.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:15]** And even still water just rests in a cup on the end table.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:23]** You pan to see the other side of the room, the large table, ornate, not used often.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:26]** Dust has settled on its dark wood surface.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:31]** There are many boxes on it, clearly just for side storage.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** And in the middle,

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:46]** are photos and frames that stacked, somewhat tossed, not neatly stacked, into a small pile.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:56]** Brought here, these pictures, when the picture needed to be replaced, for whatever reason, with something else.

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:12]** We pan over and look down at the photos, and we see that these are photos of an adult Colin Edenbrand, his family, his friends, smiling, laughing, arms over his mom.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:39]** time starts to move backwards and the photos on top begin to disappear and we see Colin progressively getting younger until we see him in residency and that photo disappears and then graduating med school disappears then dating and fun times with family and friends maybe he's friends with him now maybe he's not the photo disappears prom

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:51]** We're starting to move back as the photo stack is getting smaller and smaller, going through pictures of Colin's life until eventually we settle on the very first photo that was placed here.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:57]** A photo of Colin and a young girl.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:04]** And we cut back to that ray of sunshine in the preserved corner.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:29]** And we see inside that, that box, an open locket, the photo of that same girl on one side and on the other side are the words inscribed in the metal, shed light, act true, embody good.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:45]** And then we come back out and Colin, you are looking at that same name, Cora Eden brand written on the chest in front of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** What do you think about Colin?

**[00:24:53 - 00:25:00]** Um, I, I think Colin having that vignette forced through his mind, um,

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:12]** So the first inkling of the possibility that his sister was still alive came when they left the asteroid and he received that message, she's alive.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:17]** And I think he might not have necessarily believed it then, but he believes it now.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:25]** And so he would probably visibly shudder and start to sweat at the possibility of...

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:28]** Not just his sister.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:47]** I think he's conflicted internally between the shock of his sister, who's believed to be dead for a decade and a half now, probably two decades, and also the joy of potentially seeing her again.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:52]** I don't know if he has it in him to hold on to that hope or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:53 - 00:26:11]** i think he's still deciding how he feels about it this is a lot to take in yeah dr okay and here's and colin i brought you guys back to the map you all are in this room i'll i'll unpause the game rick 19 is keeping watch outside

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:16]** I'm not ready to move on.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** Also, shout out to Vinny for that great whole scene.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:21]** Oh, you wrote that?

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Nice, Vinny.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** I thought it was all John's work.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:26]** I gave John the credit, but I'll take it back and give it to you, Vinny.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:33]** This really gets me my brain ticking again, this whole three-fold conspiracy.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:41]** The three of us, with Nico, Ryan, stepped onto the chimera.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:49]** But we all just, we started at that station for each of our own individual reasons.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:52]** And when we got on the Chimera, that's when things went haywire.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** And we met Colin at Omicron.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:11]** But now if Cora's here, if Cora's involved, then Colin was chosen as a child for this experimentation.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:19]** So how far back does the rest of us or were the rest of us targeted?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** That sounds like another fold into the conspiracy.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** I think that's the biggest fault.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** The fault given the take.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** Okay.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** We can keep playing though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:34]** It's a good question.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:35]** Yeah.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** Does Vinny open the box?

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** Oh, definitely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** Immediately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:43]** What's in the box?

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:45]** What's in the box?

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:56]** You open the box and much like the empty box in that room, there is not much in here.

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:03]** It's been unused except for a pair of

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:22]** Clothing seems pretty, let's say uniformish gray, some blue, and then you see a very familiar symbol of ring works in yellow on the chest patch.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:28]** And there are boots, black boots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Do you recognize the boot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** And it is not, in fact, a dick in the box.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:33]** Right.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:38]** What what kind of black like like dressy, like fashionable boots or like work boots?

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** Like what?

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** What's the vibe of these boots?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** It is work boots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** OK.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:51]** Yep.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:55]** And this is like I'm in a medical center, like a hospital bay, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:23]** yeah maybe dr okay or or now colin give me maybe an engineering or medicine check pro the two of you medicine's probably more yeah because colin doesn't have engineering yeah so i'm rolling for engineering or medicine whichever one you want oh they're the same that's a 19 on the die for a 31 31 from yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:25]** Uh, 33.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** Negative 19.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:27]** 33.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:32]** Both of you come to this conclusion independently.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:38]** You think about the way that there are names on his chest.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:41]** There's clothing inside.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:41]** That's it.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Then Dr. Okay.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:46]** You think about the paraphernalia that you saw.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:56]** And you think this is some sort of interrogation room.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:02]** And then you're like, well, there are no shackles.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:07]** There's nothing keeping people here.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:17]** You think, well, maybe this device or whatever they're doing to get information...

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:25]** it renders people sometimes incredibly helpless.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:39]** And there's just enough here in terms of, I need to look back to see what you all took, what you found, but you think there's probably just enough here to sustain people, maybe until they're no longer needed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:43]** That's a chilling thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:58]** I'm going to break out my melee apprehension pole and clear out the... These are bathrooms we've determined, right?

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:00]** Just from the exterior look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:01]** Yeah.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:04]** Yeah, those two are... The two...

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:30]** five doors here the one you came in on the south three in the north and one on the east um and you're gonna go up and open up the bathrooms yeah okay as you walk up it is locked but as you walk up you don't need a perception check to hear just this this i don't even know how to say it it's like it's like a

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:38]** Like a snake hissing?

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:40]** Or water flowing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** Yeah, mechanical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** You think like water.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:46]** In Sirenscape, I've tried to pull up some running water.

**[00:31:48 - 00:32:07]** like a river brook but but actually not like just yeah more like constant more yeah more like plumbing yeah who has the uh comms device or the the handheld device from the reptoid steward outside

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:34]** oh it's feedback no one remember it would have been here's or dr okay because they're the ones that hacked it yeah i think it was maybe here's yeah yeah i think here's no surely not no because you have to turn off the turret yeah i think unless you you you then used it and you're like i'm done with this and you just throw it behind you like you do with everything you're just like that's fine uh

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:37]** I have to carry swords and other shit.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:38]** Swords.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:39]** Yeah, I guess I'll have it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:43]** Hit you once, I'm going to throw it behind me.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:45]** Rick, do you still have your signal jammer on?

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** No.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:47]** No?

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** Turn it off.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** Yeah, I turned it off.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:56]** Kelly, you feel like there is an incoming notification to that console.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** As Dr. O.K.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** is walking up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:03]** He takes it out of his bandolier and takes a look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Okay.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Just a moment.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** Got something incoming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:12]** Yeah, there is a call to notification from Tinder.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:15]** Yeah.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** New matches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:21]** I made a profile for you after What's Her Name Regrettably Passed.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** Sexy dragons in your area.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:26]** Sexy lava striders in your area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:29]** Yeah, lava striders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:31]** Man, my DMs are blown up.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** They're blown up.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:34]** With these lava striders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:38]** It's an all call from the station.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:41]** Someone else inside Terrapin is calling this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:42]** It's unknown.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** What do you do?

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:45]** Check it.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:50]** Well, it's an all call, meaning it goes out to everyone concurrently that has one of these devices at this base.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:51]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** That would be how I would interpret that.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:54]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** Yeah.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:58]** Well, I wouldn't pick it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Okay.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:02]** Wait, is it a text or is it like a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:08]** Sorry, it's not an all call like a party line.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** No, it's not a party line.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:13]** But it's a call that's going out that you can tell is coming to this device.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** Someone is trying to call this device.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:21]** And it's apparent that based on the device and everything, it's coming from somewhere inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:26]** The phone call was from inside the house?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** Inside the house.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:29]** It's like an official line.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:34]** Imagine that you have an intercom, except it's trying to move through into this device.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:38]** It's like a specific... Is this like a one-way communication, you think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:54]** It seems like it's it's a general call like if you wanted to say something Well, I can't I'm so sorry I need to understand what you mean by a general call like you are asking a lot of questions Someone is trying to get in contact with you on that comms device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:54]** Are you specifically?

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:55]** Like they're like, all right.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:57]** They are this particular call.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** They are trying to get to us.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:58]** They know it's us.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:03]** There's something coming through Do you pick up or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:08]** Well, I wouldn't pick up, but I guess, you know, for the story, here's will pick up.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:12]** I wouldn't pick up because I don't pick up random calls.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** No, who does that these days?

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:14]** I do.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:18]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:22]** Yeah, he just hits the red phone button.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** Guys, I have a call coming in.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:26]** I'm going to say anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** Don't say anything.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:32]** We're just going to listen to it.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:57]** all right for the sake of the story you've already left a new can you broadcast it over our comms yeah sure here's we'll do that he picks it up and says nothing all right he just wants to listen you pick it up and you hear just the sound of static for a second and then a voice comes on


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:02]** You're too late, Colin.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:07]** Oh, s***.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Too late to put it together.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:11]** To act.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** And you couldn't stop it.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** Any of it.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:22]** And the thing is, that you'll always be too late.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:28]** Your parents, they'd be ashamed.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:33]** And I'll let you in on a secret.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** I won't be so late.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:40]** I won't be so lazy.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:52]** But I'm you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** The call drops.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** Dude, he's trying to put you on tilt.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** He just looks at Colin.

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** Concerned.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** Do I recognize this voice?

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** It is the voice of Orfear Biden.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:09]** What the f***?

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** I should have kept his armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** I should have kept his armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** I swear to God.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** Yeah.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:21]** If Orgot's somehow alive, then I'm gonna double-click this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:25]** Dr. Ricky's gonna try and pick this lock and open it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** Give me an engineering or computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:37]** Does a 18 do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** For engineering?

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** An 18 does do it.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** You think this is

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:49]** You can tell this door is not as high profile as a door into.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** I mean, it's a bathroom door.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:51]** Exactly.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:53]** It unlocks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:55]** All right.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** I got the melee out.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** I'm going to clear this bathroom.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** I hear some water running.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:06]** Maybe there's something nefarious back there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** You hear over the comms.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** Be careful.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** You're all clear in the hallway.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** I'll keep an eye out here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:20]** You open and walk in, and immediately... It's like a sauna.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:23]** Just this wave of steam hits you.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Yeah, it feels good, actually.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:36]** If... It is the same temperature as whatever is outside, and is part of the reason why this place has been so humid and steamy.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:41]** Both sinks, they've just left the water running full tap, and...

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:44]** You think, I mean, where are they getting their water?

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:48]** You're not sure, but they certainly have a geothermal energy source.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** This thing can stay hot for millennia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:54]** They don't live in California, that's for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:57]** And they don't live in California.

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:00]** It's the first moisture your pores have felt since we left your catalyst.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:27]** yeah yeah you're like oh god i think dr okay would be like doctor okay yeah and maybe just like slip into you know like oh this feels nice it feels like home yeah yeah yeah this is more direct moisture for sure compared to just like humid air outside this is like the the actual steam hitting you yeah yeah i think sorry will or vinnie while that's happening you see colin turn about eight different shades of red

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:38]** like after all of everything that's happened over the last three days and this revelation like you better come correct or here dr okay stepping into the room and then um seeing colin kind of turned red he'll say to colin we'll take care of him


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** I'll take care of him.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:48]** He has compound eyes, so you can't really tell, but he's kind of like side-eye looking at you.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:51]** And he does say, like, are you okay, buddy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:55]** You look a little flushed there.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** I'm guessing that.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** I'm not okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** I need to find this.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Okay.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** We'll make sure we get him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:06]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:12]** is going to step through the bathroom and there's a door on the far side.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:21]** Can I tell anything about that door from this side of the door?

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:28]** You think that... Is it like a Jack and Jill bathroom situation here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** A Jack and Jill bathroom?

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:38]** You think that the door... Colin steps up to cover your six, by the way.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:38]** You can't tell too much.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** It's the same make as the other door.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:42]** As the door behind you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** That's about it.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Sorry, I need to derail just a little bit.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** More conspiracy stuff.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:56]** What if the Reptoids... They had their own plan for Colin...

**[00:41:57 - 00:42:20]** and then the grays took colin and so the whole stewards attacking the grays was them just trying to get colin back from the grays and so colin actually has nothing to do with the other three of us that's a theory i don't know about bush docus and

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:23]** Nodens.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:28]** Conspiracy theory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:32]** And I don't even know yet because I haven't talked to the Grazer Reptoids about this yet.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** No, I know.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** Look, it's not my secret.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:37]** They haven't told me, right?

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:40]** That's the thing.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** They being Paizo?

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:44]** No, the Grey's Anatomy.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:46]** It's not me.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** I don't even know yet.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** So I'm finding it out with you.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:49]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:53]** It takes so many light years to contact them here on Earth.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:53]** It does.

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** That John doesn't know.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:57]** Yeah.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** So many.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** Their response.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:03]** It'll be at least like 100 more episodes before we get an answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:09]** This is why we keep, you know, spacing out each book is because I have to wait for the next answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:19]** I mean, we have a quantum willow chip that's allowed to, that we can entangle messages across vast distance, but still there's a lot of lag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Yeah.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:21]** Yeah.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:24]** Sort of like deep sea submarine communication.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:24]** I don't know.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:33]** I don't know if you didn't know anything about that, but like sort of the like long wavelengths they have to use to send energy that I don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** I think we should stop talking about that.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:37]** No one on our podcast knows anything about submarines.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:39]** So let's not waste time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** No one here has ever been on a submarine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** Yeah, no, none of us have.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** I rode one at Disneyland.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** Who would do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:46 - 00:44:03]** It's like a glass bottom boat


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:06]** So Dr. K's at the door, Colin's behind him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:12]** Well, Rick, back in the hallway, is going to step back and shut the door behind him, because I realize we left that open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** It's just a various landscape, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:21]** And he's going to put some tape across it, just in case somebody opens it.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:28]** Just to avoid it broken, you know that?


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:32]** Yeah, it's more just an indication.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** He's not going to try to stop anybody from coming in because he also doesn't want to lock.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:38]** He was thinking about he doesn't want to lock themselves into the building and trapped.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** But he wants to know if that door is open or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Yeah, fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:46]** And then he's going to ask over the comms, like, what is your status?

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** Are you moving in further?

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:47]** Should I move up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** Should I join you?

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:49]** Yeah.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:53]** Well, we can move further.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:58]** I haven't moved yet, but there's another room here through the bathroom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:08]** I mean, I don't know how big that room is in there, but in the hallway, I have four doors and a turn corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:17]** Yeah, we're like in the middle section of this large block of rooms.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** And Dr. O.K.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** is going to check if the door is locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:25]** Dr.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:27]** O.K., the door is locked.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:30]** So what do y'all decide to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** Got another locked door here.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:34]** I think I'm going to try and jimmy it open.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:44]** And rolls 17 on the die for 31 engineering.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** The door.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** To unlock it.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Unlocks.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:53]** Get my leak sheet pick out.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:54]** Yeah.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:58]** So Dr. K is moving forward.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** Hears his chilling over by another door.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** Rick, what do you do?

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:04]** You haven't heard back yet about what to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** I think he's just on standby.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:12]** He assumes that if something goes wrong over there, he'd hear it and would run in.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:15]** But he's worried something's going to happen in this hallway.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:18]** And he doesn't want to get pinched.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** Rick19, give me a perception check.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:21]** Oh, f***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:29]** 15 on the die for a total of plus 7 or plus 9.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:31]** It's plus 9, so 24.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:31]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:38]** You hear something on the other side of the door.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** I'll turn off the water now.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:47]** You hear something on the other side of the door immediately to your right, about 10 feet ahead of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:49 - 00:47:16]** this the door the first door the first door on your right he'll say to the comms like i have movement it is the the first door to my right there's some sounds coming from there and he's gonna step back um away from that door and but he still has an eyesight of it and he points his gun at it uh i think cullen and he turns on his shield standard action


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:29]** that door in the corner yeah in the south southeast corner of this interrogation bedroom area i think leads to the hallway


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:32]** Hi, I'll see you over there.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:35]** And Colin posts up right behind that door.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:41]** And Keys is like, Rick, I'm right behind the door across the hall.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:44]** If they breach and it's subtle, let me know.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:49]** I'll pop the store open and fill them full of needles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:54 - 00:48:00]** I'm going to help check out these other rooms, these other doors, but if you need help, I'm here.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:04]** So Dr. O'Kay's posted up at the door to the north.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** Colin's posted up at the door to the east.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** The north.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:21]** Here's... Give me... Give me a... Well, what are you trying to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:27]** You're going to open... At the sound of an oncoming, I'm going to be like, hold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:36]** It's like you last time when you were trying to sneak up and Kev was like, will is trying to give commands on the video call.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:40]** You were like over here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:40]** Okay.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:41]** Yeah.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:43]** Okay.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** Wait.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:44]** So, so.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** So Dr. Okay.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:53]** Saying that to us, like hold because of whatever Kevin heard or no, I'm personally holding at the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:57]** I'm not going to go further now that we've heard movement elsewhere.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:10]** Um, I'm going to maybe step back into behind Colin still at the door for the, um, the bathroom, the bathroom.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:14]** And I'm going to take out my, uh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:17]** I don't love that we don't have shared vision.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:22]** You guys are saying what your movements are, but I can't see where you're standing in relation to myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:28]** That is the right thing to do, as much as I love tactics or whatever.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** I miss steps right now.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:33]** I should be helping out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:36]** I'm going to ask Colin, too, if that door is open or if it's locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** I'm going to check the door, see if it's open or locked.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** It is...

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** Unlocked.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:45]** Oh, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:50]** Rick19, give me a engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:54]** Uh-huh.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:56]** Uh-huh.

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:02]** While you roll that, Colin very much hopes there's a bogey there, because he would love to get into a fight right now.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:04]** It's Orvi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** The big O. Oh, no, I got 20, though.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** You got 20.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** Yeah.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:16]** You know that it's the sound of a door being locked or unlocked.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** That's what you heard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:20]** The door in the hallway?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:45]** is the one that i heard i heard yeah yeah yeah yeah and you you like thought you heard like a little bit of like yeah yeah just like a little bit of some movement you know it's like there's there's a there's a combination of several sounds when when your brain identifies that there was movement behind that door it it sounds like somebody just locked or unlocked that door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:50]** What do you want to do?

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Should we breach it?

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** Well, I'm not going to breach it alone.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** Colin opens his door.

**[00:50:59 - 00:50:59]** You're not alone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** I don't know what door you're at.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Oh, okay.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** Colin steps out, too.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Rick shoots at him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:18]** So there's two doors, right?

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:24]** Like the hallway, Rick stepped back and the, the two doors is one on like right around the corner of the, on the left side.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:27]** And then, cause it's a kind of a left-hand turn.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:30]** And then there's a door right across from it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** Shaped hallway.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:34]** And so Rick kind of stepped back.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:36]** So he has just a view of the door straight across.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** Cause that's where he heard the sound come from.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:42]** And Colin comes popping out of the other one, right into his line of sight.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:45]** I'm taking that boogie out.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:54]** Honestly, Rick, for a second, draws on you, but he doesn't pull the trigger.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:57]** He's like, oh, you scared me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** Let's clear this, sucker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** You scare us, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:04]** It's you.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:06]** Colin steps up to see if the door's locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** John pauses the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:14]** John pauses the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** A little spinning wheel save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:20]** You hear the sound of the god pausing the game.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** Guys, I can't move.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** And is here still checking out the storage in the corner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:27]** Well, he changed his mind.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** He's like, I should probably help out.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:32]** But he's now in the corner still because he can't move.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:34]** But he will move now that it's unpaused.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** He's going to get right behind.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:39]** Actually, he's going to go out this bottom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:41]** Bernice is going to follow here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Bernice follows here.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:48]** Bernice and me make a good team.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** Bernice and I.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:53]** We're good at grammar as well.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** We're good at grammar as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** Rick steps up to the corner.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** You guys are acting like a team.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:06]** Again, you guys have slowly been doing that over this, like you've really started to funnel.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:10]** And even though the four of you don't trust each other, you do trust each other to have each other's backs.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:14]** Yeah, we haven't had any distrust.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:45]** sorry i was thinking how you guys didn't get matching friend tattoos and i was like oh even though you all secretly hate each other you've worked together yeah sorry i did that was so loaded i was thinking that in my head uh that was not meant to be that at all um no you do trust each other in combat and in a lot of other ways so what do you want to do shared experience i guess i want to find out if the door's locked yeah you want to find out if the door is locked


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:47]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:50]** You go.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Schrodinger's lock.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** It's locked or unlocked until you check it.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:56]** Until you check it.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** You will never know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** You go to unlock it.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:08]** And Colin, I need everybody to roll me a perception check before you open the door.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** Colin included?

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** Colin included.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:14]** Rick got an 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:16]** Dr. K got a 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:19]** That's a 20 on the die for a 29.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:19]** 17.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:22]** 25 for Dr. Okay.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** 29, right?

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:25]** Yep.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** 29 for Colin.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** Here's, you got a what?

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:30]** 17.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** 17.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** Rick, 19?

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:34]** 11.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** 11.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:36]** Okay.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** It's a bum.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** It's a bum.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** It's not a bum.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** Sweet.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:43]** It's a bum?

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:45]** It's a bum.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:46]** There's a bum.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:54]** Now, Colin, you go to open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** No, you checked if it was locked, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** Sorry, check if it's locked.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Thank you.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:03]** And you see it is not locked.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:08]** I will remind the audience and the players that they're

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** Colin, step back.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:23]** What are you reminding us of later?

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:24]** Sorry.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:28]** Go ahead.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:34]** I think that there might be more than one access to this room.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:38]** Step back and open that door, but cover the other door down the hall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:44]** I'm pretty sure I need to be right next to the door to open it.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** I think you could be Kitty Corner for that, right?

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:47]** Aye.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:48]** Aye.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:49]** Aye.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:49]** I see what you mean.

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:50]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:53]** So Colin would move Northwood Square over.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:55]** Yeah, yeah, that's all I do.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:58]** And in Munchkin terms, kick the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:00]** Wait!

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** Oh.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:07]** I'm going to ready an action to shoot if there's something hostile on the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** If there's something hostile on the other side.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:12]** Okay.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:14]** So Dr. K and Rick can call that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:16]** Trained forward.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** Sights are up.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:25]** He does the same with magic missiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:27]** Okay.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** You ready magic missiles?

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:29]** I do.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:32]** If you see that f***er over here, he's mine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** I'll take out non-lethal action on him.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** You'll take out non-lethal action?

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** That's fair.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:44]** And with that, Colin opens the door.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** Boop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:50]** You open the door and you can see

**[00:56:52 - 00:57:00]** Inside, another stagnant room, but still use that same sense of humidity waffles out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:09]** These reptoids like it moist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:15]** You also see several cans of larval kafak just strewn about the floor.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:25]** Rick 19, Dr. O.K.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:29]** Actually, all four of you, I need you to give me another perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:33]** Uh-oh.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:35]** Ooh, natural 20 for a total of 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:38]** I got 27.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** That's a one for 10.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:44]** Which makes sense because I can only see like half a square into the room.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:46]** Rolled a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:48]** 14 to Dr. O.K.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:50]** No, I got a 27.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** 27.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** My, my perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:55]** He can see 17.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** So what does he see?

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:57]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** Slug's got to be perceptive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:02]** Very pretty, pretty perceptive.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** So here's got a 17.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** You got a 27.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:09]** Yeah.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:14]** Colin, you got a 10, 10.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:15]** Excellent.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:16]** Rick 19.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:19]** You got a 29, 29.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:22]** Okay.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:44]** Rick19, you are the only person to see a gun from around the couch on the corner starting to charge up.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:48]** And that's our game.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** Suck.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Yep.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** Who knows?

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:55]** Who knows?

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** That's fine.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** We're rich.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** Yowzers.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:01]** Yowzers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** Yikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:10]** Welcome back to We'll Save and the Interstellar Tales from the Extragalactic Adventure Anthology.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:25]** Why don't you try sorting out your own shit for a change?

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:32]** I'm staying out of this one, guys.
