## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:25]** Yeah.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** Don't walk forward, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Smash you over the head.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:31]** Take 1d6 non-lethal damage.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:33]** Kelly, I didn't hear a welcome to Will say from you.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Just want to check in.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** It's so quiet this time.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** Yeah, it's quiet.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Did you say it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:40]** I mean, it's really early for a welcome to Will say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** That's true.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** What time is it?

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** I have a thing.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:45]** It says it's 9.52 in the morning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** Yeah, it's 10 a.m.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** over here.

**[00:02:47 - 00:03:05]** but it is uh i did say that i was like what's that i said it like that i'm gonna go back in the tape i'll find that and i'll put it right there what's up right after you said it i won't say we'll say it's like a cult now like all i want to do is

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:24]** yeah that's it yeah we almost we almost we almost called our we almost wanted to call our followers the same right back when that's true which i still am torn on but like uh but uh but yeah that would have worked out yeah cold it's a shade too close to jim jones right now


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** It really is.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** Yeah.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:26]** Wow.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** Wow, Benny.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** All right.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** That's cool.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** That's good.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:31]** Well, speaking of that, we do have a banter.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** We do.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** I think.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** I know it's going to be, but it depends on this role.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:39]** If you could start a cult.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:39]** Yeah.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:43]** In as much detail as possible, how would you start it?

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:43]** No, no, no.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Nope.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:44]** That was right.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** I thought you were going to do the villain one.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:48]** Well, that's what I was going to say.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** Well, I realized that I had to roll for it.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** I just didn't know if we had done that.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** And that's what I rolled.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:54]** So, perfect.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:58]** From Taco Monk Kyle, who is your favorite bad guy in any fiction?

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** Oh, fictional bad guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** I have a few.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Yeah?

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** You want to kick us off?

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** I mean, okay.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:14]** I just want to get... I think Anakin Skywalker, Darth Vader should be top tier.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** But...

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:24]** As a software engineer, I've actually thought about Hal in 2001 A Space Odyssey a lot.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** Is Hal the villain?

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** He kind of is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:35]** He's the villain, but also is his programming the villain or the person who gave him the instruction the villain?

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** And so it gets into this murky area.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:45]** And I find that villains are often people you would sympathize, good villains are ones that you would sympathize with.

**[00:04:46 - 00:05:15]** and sure yeah like they're not truly a villain in their own eyes right um which is interesting for anakin because like he kind of does this sort of arc where he's starts off well-intentioned becomes truly evil and then at the end he's like reconciling with that evil and because that's one of those yeah that's that's one of those arcs that we're talking about those tropes of yeah

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:38]** going evil and the redemption arc right back to being good and then it's interesting to go back to this oh sorry I'm just gonna my like probably my favorite movie of all time would be Lawrence of Arabia and it'd be easy to say that just the Turks are the sort of evil but really it's

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:41]** It's the Turks as well as the British.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:47]** And then you get to like, oh, what is the evil really?

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** And it's war.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:51]** It's government.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:51]** Yes.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:52]** Yes.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** Is the villain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** I was going to revisit the Star Wars stuff a little bit.

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:03]** And granted, I'm definitely not on the developed and evolved scale that you've taken it.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:13]** But just from a cool factor, I think the Stranger was one of the greatest Star Wars Sith Lords.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** I thought he was really cool in the Acolyte.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** Oh, yes.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** Yes.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:25]** He was the scariest Sith Lord, I think, up to Darth Maul.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:34]** And then on top of that, I'm really, rest in peace, but Ray Stevenson, is that his name?

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:37]** The one that played the gray giant.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:40]** But he wasn't really a villain, per se.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:40]** Ahsoka?

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:41]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** I don't know.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:42]** I don't know.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** We're getting there.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:43]** He was great.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** Thrawn's also cool.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** He was a great Jedi.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** Star Wars has a lot of great villains.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:47]** Yeah.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:48]** They really do.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:57]** Another classic villain that just kind of sticks in my head was back in the golden days, especially playing video games, was Boris, the Russian actor.

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:57]** Nice.

**[00:06:57 - 00:07:02]** Who wore Hawaiian t-shirts and had a very comedic death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** I'm a genie, Thrawn.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:05]** Thrawn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:09]** Thrawn is cool when not in Ahsoka, though.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:11]** In Ahsoka, he's f***ing awful.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:18]** But in the books and in actually the Rebels television show, he's not like a giant moron.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** But Ahsoka is a very poorly written show, so that makes perfect sense.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:25]** Although I do think that that Grey Jedi is kind of cool.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** He's a cool dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** Ray Stevenson's orangey red lights.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:28]** Great.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:57]** yeah all the star wars shows now are pretty terrible except for andor which you guys need to uh yeah yeah that is actually one of my picks uh is and granted i haven't seen season two but i do love the villain uh what's his name the guy who first starts off investigating cassian andor on that planet you know i'm talking about the guy who's just like the guy who up who like ranks up

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:21]** yeah yeah yeah like pencil pusher yes i hate him yes but i think you're supposed to yeah yeah yeah he's so good and the fact that he meets that one other military commander who shares the same mentality of like no no no no this is a binary if something bad happens i need to take care of it and he's like yes this is what we need to do like god that's so and then like he's a great character

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:46]** yeah like i just re-watched that with ariel and uh we finished on episode three because i wanted to see it and at and at the end she was like yes i definitely want to continue but we were talking about it like that scene where he's just in shock he's in shock because he's never seen anything like this happen i mean no spoilers but like what happens at the end of episode three he's like how did this all like how did we get here it's yeah it's awesome i also really like um oh yeah go ahead


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** I'm just saying he's a brilliant character.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** I don't even know if I think of him as a villain.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** I think he is in a way.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** Don't spoil it.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** He believes he's doing the right thing, right?

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** He does.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** Some villains can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:03]** Every well-written villain believes they're doing the right thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** I don't know if everyone does.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** Unless...

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:09]** Yeah, there's some debate that could be had about that.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** All the well-written.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** But I agree.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:12]** I think generally I agree with Vinny's assessment on that.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:14]** Most of the time that is the case.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** I don't want to spoil season two for Don.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:17]** I'm going to hold my tongue and save this for another time, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:18]** Yeah, I don't want to spoil it either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:19]** It's hard to.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:21]** So I can't go into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:24]** I kind of want to debate about how well Ahsoka's written.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** I mean, Ahsoka's a great series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:30]** I want to make sure that we get to everyone's villains.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** Alright, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** Is it Rebels?

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:33]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:36]** Have you seen Clone Wars?

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** Have you seen Clone Wars, though?

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** Yes, I've seen it all.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** You still think that Ahsoka is a well-written show?

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:44]** It's such garbage.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:47]** They overly explain everything like you're seven years old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:49]** They're explaining it to a new audience.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:54]** It has to be written that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:57]** It's basically the Starship Troopers cuts.

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:01]** I'm going to change fan names for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** We can save this for another show.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:06]** I have to answer my answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** Okay, cool.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** Hold on.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:11]** Q is awesome.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** John Delancey, top tier.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** I'm unfamiliar with this.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:15]** Who's this?

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** TNG, baby.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** TNG.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** TNG.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** Also, Will, I started watching Voyager.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** Also really good.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:22]** Voyager's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** Yeah.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** Kelly, go.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** Orson Krennic.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** I like Orson Krennic from Andor.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** Oh, he's just such like a diva.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:37]** And like, you know, like without it, it's not like a it's this is not a spoiler.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:41]** But in season two, he's like cow kite, cow kite alternatives, cow kite substitutes.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:44]** And just the way that he just talks and is just so over the top.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:45]** I know.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:45]** I love him.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** He's just very enjoyable.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** He's a very enjoyable villain.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:48]** Yes.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:51]** So I think Cyril's another.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:54]** Oh my God.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:54]** I need to know.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** Don't spoil it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:55]** I need to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:58]** She's so good.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** She's the worst.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:10]** I saw on Facebook one of those nine square images that was like, all the women in Star Wars are, not you, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:10]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:14]** Benny, who's your pick?

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** I've got two that I can't decide between.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:19]** I loved The Good Place.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:37]** And Ted Danson's character as the villain in seasons one through N, as long as he is the villain, was such a great... Michael was such a great slapstick, built this place to be... If you haven't seen The Good Place by now... Stop listening.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:40]** Fast forward to the next 30 seconds.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:46]** Like they're in hell and he's made it so believable that it's a spectacular reveal.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:56]** And also like his transition from I'm going to run hell to like, okay, maybe these humans aren't so bad and I'm going to explain the time knife and it's spectacular.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** It's just great character development all around.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:06]** Between that and Cave Johnson from Portal.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** I agree with that.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** Wow, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Loved him.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:14]** He was the villain that you couldn't help but love.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:20]** Okay, I have another contender for that, which thank you for reminding me about this.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** Handsome Jack.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** Borderlands 2?

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** Handsome Jack.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** What's that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:25]** Dude.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** So good.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** Handsome Jack.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:31]** Like, you like him and you also want to f***ing take him out.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** I don't know.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:35]** He always came off as entirely too frat bro for me.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:55]** i could i just he's got he sounds like he has a punchable face that's the point that's that's why like that voice actor nailed that right absolutely nailed it and for me it's like i can't i can't like him because i know he sucks right if we're going video games um from vagrant story


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:58]** If anybody's never played Vagrant Story, it's a fantastic game.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** It's PlayStation 1.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:03]** It deserves a reboot and a remake and a sequel and everything else, and it's never gotten any of it.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:10]** But Sidney is such a deep character that evolves throughout the storyline.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** It's so good.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** But he's just... Look him up.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** He's pretty cool.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** He's a cult leader.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:22]** He's got this giant tattoo on his back, and he has these metal arms with giant sharp fingers.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** That's cool.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:28]** Yeah, he's a f***ing villain.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:30]** I want to play his game now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:30]** It's so good.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:32]** I also like... I have two more.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:36]** Stand out to cure Hans Lander from... Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:38]** Hans Lander from Inglourious Basterds.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** Oh, yes.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:42]** I will co-sign that all day, every day.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:42]** Absolutely.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:44]** Hans Lander's a spectacular villain.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:45]** Yeah.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** He's so good.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** He's so f***ing cool.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:49]** I love these scene-chewy villains.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** Him and his f***ing calabash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** Oh, my God.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:58]** I don't know if you all watch this, but The Wheel of Time.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** I haven't watched it.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** You got canceled, right?

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** Yeah, I did.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** I haven't seen it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:06]** I just bought all the books, and I'm planning to read it.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:09]** I'm trying to get through Dune before I start Wheel of Time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:09]** Right, right, right.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:13]** I mean, the show was good enough, but there's one actress.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** The show was, I think, a mixed bag.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** Mostly good.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:20]** Some moments that were a little CW, but then a lot of moments that were really deep.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:25]** But the one person who stole every scene as a villain was Natasha O'Keefe playing Selene.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** And if you've seen it, you know what I mean.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:34]** She just plays the field and is likable and detestable at the same time.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:39]** And that show, I think, is worth watching for several arcs.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:41]** Even though it got canceled, then hopefully it'll get picked back up.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:46]** But even for all the things that weren't good about it, I think there are some really good things about it.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:56]** Her acting and her character portrayal and her conflict is really, really good and really came to a good head in season three.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** Kelly, you had your hand raised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:00]** I was just going to say, the book series looks like it's really cool.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:07]** I've only seen scenes from the show, and I guess it's a mixed bag, but there probably are good moments of it, but it looks like... It's more good than bad.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:19]** The outfits are... I feel like there's world building, but then when I look at those outfits, and not having read the books, maybe this is why I think this, but it looks like cosplay done too much or something, and I'm just like... The outfits were one thing.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:21]** It's unpractical.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** Their face masks and everything, I'm like, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:31]** Some of it is like a little, like that's one of the not good things, but it doesn't really pull you out as much as you would think.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:57]** once you that's good like so the writing is good in the show and stuff like in the characters the writing is also like it's it's both good and bad again more good than bad okay but it lends itself to like it's like it's like really like sometimes really good sometimes decent and then the acting again a lot of times really good it uh it also has uh who's the main actress who plays um moraine i said i you would know her rosamund pike she's like killer hike

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** Yeah.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:00]** You'll recognize her as soon as you look her up.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** She's the one from Gone Girl, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** Oh yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:03]** Yeah.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:13]** Her and the guy who plays Daniel Henry, who plays her, like, I forget what the name is, but like, you know, the Aes Sedai are basically the, like the wizards.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:19]** And then you have men and like pretty much only women can be Aes Sedai.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:23]** And then they have men who are like battle trained, like protectors.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:26]** And they're like linked to each Aes Sedai or more than one sometimes.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:27]** Yeah.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:29]** You'll enjoy it, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** Back to the villains thing.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** Gone Girl.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:34]** That woman is the greatest villain of all time.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:34]** That was crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:35]** Yes.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:36]** I haven't seen it.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** So good!

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** No spoilers.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** Alright, we've been talking for a while.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:45]** Does anybody else want to throw in, cast in a villain on the lot before we...

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** play?

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** There's so many out there.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:55]** I feel like we're very limited to just our recent thoughts and got stuck on Star Wars and how Kelly doesn't appreciate good art.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:56]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:58]** That's so bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:06]** As a big fan of that character, as a big fan of that character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:10]** They casted the voice actor from the animated series.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** She's fine.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:11]** It's the writing.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** It's the writing.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:15]** It's the writing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:22]** Um, Kelly, do you have any, uh, any shout outs that you want to give here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:22]** Any?

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:22]** I don't know.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:23]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:26]** Um, shout out to everyone on our discord.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** Everyone on discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:30]** Bob said something about a can of tuna and half a Snickers.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:33]** Cause that we was talking about sandwiches today.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:37]** Sadly, I guess I'll just say that she's really busy these days.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** There's a lot going on.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** I just wish you luck.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** Give yourself some self-care.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:45]** Now she doesn't have a lot of time to have good food that she likes.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** That looks good.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Hope you get some good food.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:49]** Yeah, give yourself some self-care, as John said.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:52]** And you and your family are safe and good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:52 - 00:18:00]** We talk about a lot of things on the Discord, including sometimes just food and how you're doing and sharing video games and whether you like the soaker or not.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:03]** So if that's of interest to you, then come on by.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** Let us know who you are.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:14]** Well, last time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:16]** Have you guys been watching the rehearsal?

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:16]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:17]** No, but I do want to.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** That is on my list.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** It looks wild.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:22]** What's the rehearsal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** Season two, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** Yeah.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:27]** The rehearsal is one of the wildest shows I've ever seen.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** It's a fantastic show.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:29]** I don't want to say anything.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** You should just start it.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:31]** Truly.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** Just start it.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:35]** It's on Max.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:35]** It's on HBO.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:36]** Now HBO.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** They're calling themselves now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** Just don't read anything about it, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** Just start episode one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:40]** Trust me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** It's like The Matrix.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:43]** Just dive in without any... Just dive in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** Don't even look at... Same for you, listener.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** Just watch it.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:56]** Last time, much like The Matrix, you all just dove in as we started right at the top of nearly combat.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:58]** As you had just opened the door.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:00]** You had just left the listener's office.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:04]** You had found the power core.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** You set up a kind of a...

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** a switch to shut it off remotely.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:15]** You would open the door into the hangar bay where you knew that you were going to have to fight for your life.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:26]** And who was standing there but Orvir holding Kaniko hostage and Officer Astara at the Vlaka and the Wetzelt just watching.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:27]** Voyeurs.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** You all start talking.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** They make their demands clear.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:37]** Put down your weapons and this can all be over.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:41]** Or else we will take out Kaniko.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** And you all start to comply.

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** Rick does.

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** Colin's pretty pissed.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:47]** And Dr. Okay, you notice that there's a trap set up.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:51]** That starts to, I don't know if you were initially going to ever actually put down your weapons.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:59]** You did throw away some of them in an effort to, but you noticed that trap and said, Hey guys, I was really just trying to sell the bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:03]** I feel like I should have gotten a plus on my sleight of hand, but I didn't need it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** So you didn't need it anyway.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** So it was all good.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:09]** We move into this place where you are like, you know what?

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** I'm going to force what's going to happen.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:14]** and you throw a sticky bomb grenade.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:19]** The only person who sees that side of hand is Kaniko.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:24]** And Kaniko is entangled, kicking off combat.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:30]** And Kaniko says, essentially, you need to get the f*** out of here.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:40]** As the facade drops, and we realize that Kaniko breathes, here is Dr. Relnodens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:42]** As Colin cranks up his middle finger.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** Yeah, exactly, exactly.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:45]** The c***.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:48]** But did you notice the way John said that?

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** Koneko here.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:55]** So that means that the other Koneko was not a Reptoid, at least that we're aware of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:58]** So there's a Koneko in the other hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:58]** Perhaps.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** The other hangar bay.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:02]** The other cargo bay, yeah.

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:05]** Let's move you guys back in because then combat kicked off immediately.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:07]** Dr. Okay unfortunately failed.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:12]** His will save starts running out and Orvier steps back, takes a shot at Colin.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:15]** Colin, you cast Wisp Ally.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:40]** and then dr keniko nodens finishes her transformation back into dr raul nodens and even entangled she casts a spell at you okay i'm just yeah she gave up the facade that she's not keniko but then she's putting on another mask of it's just weird to me


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:40 - 00:25:08]** have y'all seen reptoids are weird um american horror story yeah depends on what season not first yeah first murder house yeah yeah yeah dr nodens is the the the the caricature of a southern woman that lives next door yeah oh hey y'all how we doing this morning that's that's all i can see when i see dr nodens yeah well you bring up a good point why would she not just go into her reptoid form yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:12]** I mean, it begs the question, how long has she been Dr. Nodens?

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:15]** How ingrained into Dr. Nodens is she?

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:42]** what she's like less reptoid and more dr noden well like it starts to like not that there's a gradation of reptoids but it starts to paint the picture of like are the reptoids that pretty much only stay in their reptoid form and they only change into something else when they go out um is it that there are some who are undercover for a while and they start to take on that life and they don't they never change and they've been that way for a while is it like an anamorph where there's a time limit and then they get stuck

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** Yeah.

**[00:25:43 - 00:26:11]** I mean, you would definitely know, Dr. K, that from like you're thinking about the the machine that like starts to pull memories that you found in that kind of interrogation space, you start to think like, all right, well, if they're pulling memories and there are definitely individuals who are like deep undercover and maybe stay in their form for a long time so as to live in it, to, you know, to memorize it, to be them, that person fully.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:17]** But anybody who has a squiggly circle is a reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:18]** Yes.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:22]** If you just look at them and they have a squiggly circle, they are a reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:27]** So if you're walking through the streets and you see someone with a squiggly circle, get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** Unmask.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** You're a reptoid.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** Yeah, you're a reptoid.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:30]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:33]** Kev, is that a filter on the video chat?

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** The squiggly circle around you?

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:37]** Or is that... Are you a reptoid?

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** I see it.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** Does anyone else see it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:42]** Okay, so with that, let's get back into combat.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** We are in the middle of round one.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:49]** Colin and Rick19 are standing right behind this trap.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** Here's is in the hallway.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:53]** Effect and Dr. Okay are further back in the hallway.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:58]** Colin, I believe you need to roll a will save, as Dr. Nodens has said earlier.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:03]** Why don't you come here, step forward for me, and cast command on you?

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** Let me know what you get with that.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** We'll save.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:09]** I would definitely fail it if you could.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:11]** If you have control over that, I recommend you failing it.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:15]** It's like the other one where if you fail it, you get something good.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Thanks, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:22]** Will dropped a gif of Sting taking off his mask from WC.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** Is it WCW at the time?

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** I have no idea.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** Yeah, that's WCW.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** It's WCW.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** That's WCW.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** WCW.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:32]** But it's Sting taking off his mask, and he's got his painted face under it.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** Nice.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:35]** Yeah.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** It's so good.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:38]** Sting was my favorite wrestler back in the day.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** That should be another banter.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:40]** Sting was great.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** Who was your favorite wrestler?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:43]** I thought we were talking about the singer Sting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:44]** Yeah, same.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** Yeah.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** Benny, what?

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** Was he the master?

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:49]** No, I was talking about the wrestler Sting.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** Vinny, what did you get on your will say, buddy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:56]** On my dispel super technologically advanced dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:58]** What they're known for.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:02]** Dispel dice.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:04]** It literally allows you a free dispel when you buy it.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Right.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** You actually have to sign off as a GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** They're super dope.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:11]** I don't know if you can see it on the camera, but they've got circuits on the inside.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:14]** The sharp edge is really nice.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:16]** It feels great in the hand.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:19]** And when you throw it, you get 21s on will saves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** You get 21 on your will save?

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** The dice doesn't even go to 21.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** How'd you do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** You're cheating.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** Cheating.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** That's Dispel Dice.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** Get a Dispel Die.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** You get a 21.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** You get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:32]** I don't think we should say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** You have a D20.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** It's just an all 20 plus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:37]** Yeah, 20 plus that.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** It's 20 plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** 20 plus two.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** 40.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:46]** 50, 40.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:46]** Okay, cool.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** I got a natural 40 on this.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:58]** You feel the compulsion to walk forward and just the anger seething inside you is hotter than the f***ing landscape of Veros and you push it down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:04]** He takes a half step forward and then a wry smile appears on his face.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** Nice try, shapeshifter.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** She's like, you'll get yours soon enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** You almost got me.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** She's like, you almost got me.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** What?

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:15]** She will get hers.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** She will get hers when she needs to.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** She actually needs to roll a reflex save.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Will, what's the DC for that reflex save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:22]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** That is acrobatics.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:25]** Thank you.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** And acrobatics.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:34]** But if you're untrained and act about it, then it's, I think the break DC is 18.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** Wait, that's what I read.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:37]** Wait, what?

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:43]** So it says here, I'll just send you a screenshot break DC, 18 acrobatics DC.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:45]** So if she uses acrobatics,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:45 - 00:30:10]** if she uses acrobatics in order to do that and that's probably that's the strength versus um acrobatics distinguisher so if they use a strength check it's a plus another an additional five because the base goes from 10 to 15 yeah so acrobatics is a 10 plus your bonuses so until it escapes with an acrobatics check or a strength check yeah so she can either do an acrobatics or a strength


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:14]** And so you're saying the acrobatics is 13, the strength check is 18.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:14]** 18.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** Got it.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:16]** Okay.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:17]** Sounds good.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** She tries to get out and cannot.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:25]** So that is one round that she is entangled currently.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** All right.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** It is Officer Astara's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:32]** And what do they do?

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** Are you going to do her turn?

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:38]** Because entangled just means you have to move half speed and something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:39]** Yeah, you minus two to AC.

**[00:30:40 - 00:31:09]** uh and attack rolls and reflex and initiative and dexterity based skill and ability checks oh yeah did you put that minus two on her yeah she is initiative oh no no no i didn't do that because technically it was surprise round first and then the initiative and then the initiative but i mean she casts yeah like uh yeah it's fine she she went this way that's fine what does she do does she move does she move


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:38]** I think I think she does actually I think she doesn't she doesn't you know who moves next turn officer Astara takes a 10 foot step forward towards you Rick 19 and ooh I know exactly what she's gonna do she pulls up her gun and

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:44]** And she's going to fire this decoupler at you, Rick19, trying to demoralize you.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:51]** Rick19, that is a 22 against EAC.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** Yep.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:53]** Yep.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** That hits.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:54]** Knew it.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** Knew it.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:57]** Officer, sorry.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:58]** Let's see.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:01]** Eight points of damage to you, Rick19.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Things are not looking good.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** I'm three for three.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:06]** Well, no, I'm three for four right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** Let's see.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:07]** Can I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** How does this work?

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** She takes a step forward.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** She's now ten feet away from you.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:15]** Starting to move in a little bit.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** Why is she doing that?

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** Why is she doing that?

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:20]** She actually takes a step forward.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:25]** Towards the wall.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:27]** I'm just saying that she moved 10 feet towards you and also towards the wall.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** Rick 19, what are you doing?

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:31]** You were just hit.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** Colin's been hit.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** Dr. K's out of the room.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:35]** Things are getting a little tense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:40]** I think Rick's a little irritated that Colin's not pulling back.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** You trying to run?

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:50]** He wants to retreat back into the hallway so they get kind of a tactical advantage and not be involved in this trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:53]** Unspoken expectations are premeditated resentments, Rick 19.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** I know.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** That is not effective relational communication.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:57]** I did say fall back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** I said fall back.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** I shouted, did you?

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** And then John told me not.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** I did.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:01]** I don't remember that.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:05]** You did it right as the round started when it wasn't your turn.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** That's why I called it on my turn.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** But it's a free action, so I can do it at any time.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:09]** Speaking is not.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:13]** I'm going to do an engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:16]** I mean, this is supposed to be all the same six seconds, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** Yeah, it's fine, dude.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:17]** It's okay.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:47]** to it what do you do what do you do or do you just risk it do you do you just risk the biscuit and see what happens i mean we have we have four combatants in this room and dr okay ran away i fled so it's like top speed and that was all i could do i know and and i don't have any weapons out so like i need to move to get a weapon out or stand still and just waste my movement oh you can move back shoot anybody uh-huh

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:50]** Just double move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** What's it going to be?

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** What's it going to be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** I've been debating this in my head this entire time.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:57]** I feel like this is a bad setup.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:01]** Rick is going to step to a guard.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** No, he doesn't need to guard step.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** Whatever.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** He steps back.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:07]** He steps back and pulls out his artillery laser and he's going to shoot at Orvier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** Shoot at Orvier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** What do you mean?

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** I don't think you can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:14]** How much?

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** I think your range is fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** Because you moved and pulled out your weapon, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** Yeah, which is fine.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** He can do that.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** He has a base tech.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** That's a base tech bonus plus one.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** You can all do that now.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** You're all hired.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** No, no, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:29]** I was just trying to... Seven on the... That's not going to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** Flies wildly.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:31]** No, no.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** Hold on.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** Let me finish my sentence, John.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** Seven on the die.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** Seven on the die.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** For a total of 17.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** Yeah.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** For a total of 17.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:38]** That still misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** 17.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:42]** The question is, does it beat his bad-ass armor AC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:43]** No, it doesn't.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** No, it doesn't.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:45]** I think his armor's a plus 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** Does it beat his bad-ass armor AC minus two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:49]** It is EAC, not KAC.

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** Oh, this is the first.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** It's KAC?

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** No, it's EAC.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** It's EAC.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:57]** It's an azimuth laser, so it's EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** And it's his EAC minus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:01]** Just do it.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** Why is it minus two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Because of the wisp ally.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** It's the first attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:11]** And that is a hit.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:11]** Yes!

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** Let's go!

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:16]** And it burns Rick just a little bit.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:21]** Just a little bit because this has actually got that psychotite on there.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** So I'm going to take one point of damage.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:27]** It burns a little bit.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:35]** Uh, and then that is going to be a D10 plus seven points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** That's too much damage.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:39]** Um, so I don't think that really, that's, that's not how that works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** That's a 10 on my flip die.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** Gross.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** That's the spider lady flip die.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** Uh,

**[00:35:45 - 00:36:09]** bam it's an eight on the die for a total of 18 damage 15 15 damage wow okay right eight plus seven is 15 yes it is you see that not all that goes through in fact a significant portion of it does not go through it's fire damage and a significant portion does not go through


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:38]** he's got dr on him rick rick will relay that to the others i shot him with my laser and it seemed to not penetrate he might be resistance to fire i mean you do recall that the others that the other uh reptile sewers you were fighting in the hallway also and remember afterwards they had taken a sick of titanic but it seems like it's even a bit more than that that doesn't go through

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** But good turn.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:41]** You still got some damage off.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:41]** Is it a good turn?

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:45]** Still got some damage off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:46]** Okay.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:49]** Can I ask you a behind-the-curtain question?

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** Yes.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** Would that have hit without Wisp Alley?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:56]** I see you trying to get a beat on his AC.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** Maybe you just got to attack more and find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** Yep.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** I see you trying to be Trixie there.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** I'm assuming it's a no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:04]** I'm seeing you being Trixie there.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:04]** Trixie Hobbitses.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Trixie Hobbitses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** All right.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:12]** Well, speaking of little creatures who talk about... Here's... It's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:13]** This is tall.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** What are you talking about?

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** He's just thin and way thin.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** My precious.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:22]** All of his... All of his, like, f***ing attacks, like, deal fire damage.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:28]** You know, I was going to get out of, like, doing Magic Missile because I have all these other cool, big...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:55]** awesome spells that i was going to do including supercharging rick's weapon but why don't you just do that including all of my other spells are fire based because it's a well he still did damage and you have a sick of titanic so you know that it's only three points of resistance and the question is what oh is it just general resistance across the board uh a sick of titanic gives you three fire or cold um fire and that's what he's got

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:59]** Well, you would know that last time, and you can see some of that same fire damage.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** But the question is, there was also a little bit more than that.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:04]** So the question is, what did the extra save?

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** What did the extra save?

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:08]** So I'm not trying to tell you how to take a turn, Kelly.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:11]** I'm just trying to give you a little knowledge, as here's probably how.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Naled.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:15]** The extra say has nothing to do with fire.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:17]** It's just a general like, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** I did not say that.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** I just said there is an extra thing.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** Maybe it's fire.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:21]** I know.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:24]** A little extra zhoosh.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** A little zhoosh.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** You spell zhoosh for me?

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:31]** Yeah, it's not spelled like you think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:56]** by the way well we'll discuss this while kelly is thinking it's spelled with a z-h-u-z-h i think or z-h-u-s-h which i thought it was j so yeah that makes sense all right kelly so we have like uh uh plus three to fire resistant base for fire resistance we negate three damage correct with three fire damage for sure we don't you don't worry about that in terms of calculating it i do worry about it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:59]** Right, but that will happen on him.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:02]** But don't worry about, just give me your full damage and I'll worry about what that's going to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:05]** Well, no, I mean, it depends what, that changes what I'm going to do.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** So that's why I'm asking.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:09]** So it's like three and then like, it's three, correct?

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:11]** Like that's like the static, like, you know.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** That's the secret titanic.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** That's correct.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:13]** All right, cool.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:16]** And then the other thing we do not know whether it's fire or not fire.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:18]** So then at minimum, we're dealing with three.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:21]** It's a bit of a gamble, but here's going to buff three.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:49]** this is how I'm reasoning through it I'm talking out loud just be my rubber ducky for like one second here which I don't know if you'll anyway that wasn't a euphemism for anything so supercharged weapon so he's going to supercharge Rick's weapon he's right here so he's going to reach through the door I don't want to keep shooting with the laser though I want to get in the hallway and pull out a melee weapon alright cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:53]** Is that what you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** I thought it was Yiddish.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** It's not.

**[00:39:56 - 00:40:01]** It's Polari, which is a British slang from sailors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:06]** But I think it's just been accepted by everybody.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:09]** I think so.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:11]** Called artificial geyser.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:21]** He's gonna cast it and it's within a range for he's gonna cast it right here between these two guys Sorry, right where's right here and between which you just guys dropped old faith.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** Can you go right?

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** I'm I'm pinging it right?

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** I see Listeners can't see the pings.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:29]** Yeah

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:30]** Jesus Christ.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:31]** All right.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** Sorry.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** I'm kind of in a bad mood right now.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:34]** I'm kind of annoyed by this.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:35]** All right.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:42]** So basically, I'm going to like, he's going to cast it between Dr. Nodens and Orvier.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:42]** Yes.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** All right.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:43]** Sounds good.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** So that's what he's going to do.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Yeah.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:48]** Uh, so here we go.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:49]** All right.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:51]** Gonna cast it.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** Artificial geyser?

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:53]** No.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** Artificial geyser.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:55]** Okay.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:58]** Talk to me about what happens with artificial geyser.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:01]** I'm, I will do that as I'm casting it.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:05]** So then, uh, he's gonna, right.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:07]** It's been so long since I've not done magic missile.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** I'm trying to like actually roll like an attack.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:11]** So let me figure out how to do that real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** Roll.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** Like.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** You don't need to roll to attack for a spell.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** unless it says that you need to.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** Right, that's how it works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:21]** All right, so he's going to cast Artificial Geyser.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:25]** And so what it is, is he creates, it creates a burst of pressurized boiling water.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:31]** It deals 3d8 slashing damage and fire damage and applies the burn condition for 1d6 to each creature in the area.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:37]** Now you have to pass a, if you, a successful reflex save has this damage and negates the burn condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** Okay, and it's a 20 foot line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:41]** No, it's a DC 17.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:41]** Okay.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** It's a 20 foot line.

**[00:41:43 - 00:42:12]** line so but that line can kind of go yeah well where does that lie yeah i see what you're saying yeah yeah i get it i get it well in that case jesus christ all right so like what does this laser do again you don't know what's like you don't know you don't know it's a trigger for a trap right i know okay all right so he's gonna he's just gonna like cast it on orbeer okay it so and the and like i guess it has to be a straight line from where he's casting


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:14]** No, I don't think so.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:18]** I think it's just a 20-foot line, but you have 60 feet, so you can cast it within.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** So I'm just going to draw a 20-foot line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:22]** Yeah, he's going to draw.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:27]** In that case, I would love to draw a line from Dr. Rel Nodens to Oravir.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** He, him.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:28]** Okay.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** Which is what they're called here.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** If a vertical line would be brilliant.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** Yeah, I'm just rotating it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:39]** I think a line spell has to be from, is it from the point where he casts it, or is it from him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:42]** Well, that's what I thought for a second, but it may not be that way.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** That's a good question.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** Which I would be happy if it weren't that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:47]** Rules, paralegals.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:49]** All right.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:52]** Gotta look up and see what the line spell does.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** What does a line spell do in Starfinder?

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:01]** Shoots away from you in a line in the direction you does it.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:01]** Target?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:02]** Yeah.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:07]** That's for a line weapon, not a line spell.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** I do see line shape burst.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:11]** You have a range of 60 feet.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:11]** Yeah.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:15]** So you can cast a 20-foot line from anywhere in 60 feet is the way I'm reading it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** Yeah, I think that's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** That's how I'm reading it, too.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:20]** As long as the line can... Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** Can the line rotate?

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:26]** Or does it have to be anywhere within that 60-foot line from here to the target?

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** I feel like you could just make it go anywhere.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:32]** I don't, I don't see why it needs to be in a straight line from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** I appreciate that ruling.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:35]** Thank you.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:43]** So he would like to do it on a straight down through these two through Dr. Real Nodens and over Pike.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** Okay.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** Uh, what is the DC of that reflexive?

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:47]** 17.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:49]** 17.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** Quite high.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** Quite high reflexive.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Yeah.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** Wow.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** Impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:54]** Impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:56 - 00:43:57]** Rick, are you seeing anything otherwise?

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:00]** I'm still, I was going to ask the paralegals.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** Okay.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:02]** Yeah, that's cool.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** Not unreasonable requests.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Let's see the other one.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:05]** Yeah.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:06]** Where's the rules?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** They both fail.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:12]** They were not considering that at all.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:17]** So they get 3d8 fire and the burn condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:41]** oh that's right you all are gonna be it's 18 damage for each 18 damage and then yeah and then uh and then the burn condition for 1d6 rounds so i'll do that now okay and i think when they for the burn condition they take burn immediately on their first turn oh cool right they take burn immediately so then they do it at the top of their next turn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Right, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** That's a little ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:46]** In just a moment, isn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** Sorry, I'm missing two rounds.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:56]** You made sure that only the half of that, if they say either way, the damage is halved from fire and slashing.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:59]** If they, yeah.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** So, like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** Oh, is not all the damage fire?

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** No, it's half fire and half slashing.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** Oh, okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:05]** Is that right?

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** Is that what I said?

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** Okay, so they are burning.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** D2D8 slashing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:12]** Yep.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** And then how much burn damage?

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Kelly, I think it's a D4.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** You want to roll it?

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** Tell me how much burn they take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:21]** So they're taking burn for two rounds, and it's six damage this round.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** Do I have to roll it each round?

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** Finder says from the caster.

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** Oh, from the caster.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:28]** Well, then we'll just apply this to... Yeah, who?

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** Just to Rick.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** You're just going to burn Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** Do you want to apply it to Dr. Nodens or to Orvier?

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** Or a veer.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:36]** Or a veer.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** Or a veer it is.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** Oh, veer.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:43]** And he takes six burn damage this round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:46]** So six burn damage and... Okay.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Yikes.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** That is horrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:50]** And he'll take it for next round as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:57]** Well, but I guess... Next round, just roll another... What's the... Is burn a d6 or d4?

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** You said d6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** That's what I meant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:05]** No, it was... I think it's just a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:20]** burning burning burning burning burning burning yeah it's a d6 of fire damage yep cool okay six so he takes six plus 18 total damage i think this round yes yes uh cool wow see that was a great spell


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:24]** That was a dope spell.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** I am impressed by that spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:27]** I did something else this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:33]** I'm going to make this rotation a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:37]** Here's going to talk to... What's her name again?

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:39]** This android who does absolutely nothing to help.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** Literally false.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** She is totally trying to help you this whole time.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:44]** But that's fine.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** It's cool.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:47]** She has been attacking.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:49]** She has been this whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Her turn is literally after yours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:51 - 00:47:16]** all right i know before she wasn't in the lineup so that's why he's just gonna like get in on this so yeah but i know you i know you solved it so all right got it yeah no she did help you out a lot in the in the fight she didn't shy away she took armor and was right you're right i was just messing around i know you were messing i was just trying to make sure she has a good image in her mind her name is effective after all yes effective effective cool

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** Rad spell.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** It's Geyser spell.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** I was not expecting that at all.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** I didn't even know that you took it.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:22]** Okay.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** Well, Zellout commented.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** She doesn't normally comment on here.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:25]** Thanks.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:28]** Thanks for the thing on the rules pair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:45]** Effecta is going to run forward and stand next to Rick and Colin and is just immediately going to see that Orvier is suffering and is going to focus fire on Orvier.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:47]** Um, she has the needler pistol.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:51]** So she is going to take a shot at Orvier.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:56]** Question is, is she in range to do that?

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:00]** Uh, I don't think the needler pistol has enough range for that.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:04]** So she's instead going to attack the wet cells.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:08]** That is to the South.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:11]** And let's see if she can.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:31]** hit the wet salt she cannot flies past she is rushing dr k's run back she is in a frenzy and cannot steady her weapon runs forward tries to shoot she says as the shot flies wide it's the bottom of round one what's else turn what does the wet cell do

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:34]** What does the Wetzelt do?

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:37]** I hear a lot of things going off in chat.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:40]** So I'm guessing that we have this rules.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:41]** No?

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** Ignore it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:43]** Okay.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** Yeah.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** Maybe for our next banter.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:47]** Cool.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** Our end of game banter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** End of our post banter banter?

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:53]** Post banter banter.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:55]** Post BB?

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:55]** Just for fun.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** As they say.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** Ah, I know what happens.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:00]** I know what happens.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** The what's out steps forward.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:08]** And as it steps forward... Question, who passed the last time that you guys were fighting what's out?

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:16]** Who passed the save, that field, the electromagnetic field that you guys have?

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** I think it was Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** The first time?

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:21]** The first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** Like...

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:44]** because i think i saved the first time bernice i thought here's did and yeah i believe so so if you recall the wet cell has that electromagnetic field that prevents certain weapons from being fired because of their crazy ability bernice saved that thing yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:44]** Yeah.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:46]** Rick put his weapon away because he realized that.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:46]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** So I think it was just Bernice.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:51]** And I thought she was going to log weapons.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** Yeah.

**[00:49:54 - 00:50:01]** So the Wetzel steps forward, but does not cross the line, but is trying to make their way.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:09]** And I think, Colin, you suddenly maybe feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up as this electromagnetic field.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:13]** Should you choose to use some sort of... How big is the field?

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:18]** It is a 15... I think it's 15 feet.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:20]** No, it's a 30-foot radius.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** Holy cow.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** Yeah, it's a big one.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:28]** I was trying to make it clear here on the chat, but do you guys see it?

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** No, probably not.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** No.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:30]** Why?

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** Why?

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:34]** It's so weird that you don't see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** I can use my imagination.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** We know what 15 feet looks like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:42]** I mean, yes, but it would just be good because I literally made a template for it.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:45]** And I don't know why you can't see it.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** I saw it for a second.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:46]** Yeah.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Here.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:48]** Do you see it now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:51]** Negative.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** See what?

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:51]** Where?

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** I don't see anything.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:54]** There was a green circle for just a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:54]** Yeah.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:56]** How do you make that green circle stay?

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:56]** Whatever.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** It's all good.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** Colin, you are in it.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** That's the point.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** Cool.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:02]** And so is Bernice, but Bernice is fine because Bernice said prior.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:04]** So that is the what's else turn.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** It's the top of round two.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** What is Orvira going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:10]** Well, Rick shouted fall back again.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:13]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:18]** Kelly, do you want to roll into the D6 for the burn damage that Orvira would take?

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:45]** oh yes happily happily there is a steady debate on whether or not you can cast it from from a point or from yourself so like i think it's safe to say okay well we've hands off the chess piece on that one if you cast it again we can we can figure it out uh i can read and see what what it was but let's keep moving kelly so what's that six damage six damage again okay all right i like it i like it i like it

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** Except I don't.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** I frigging hate it.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** It is the top of round two.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** Orvi or Pyke's turn.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:54]** How long does this geyser last, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:56]** Like, was it?

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:59]** Yes, that's an excellent question.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** Let me see.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:04]** Give me a moment here.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** Duration instantaneous.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** No, that's the casting.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** A successful reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** No, I think that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:09]** It doesn't say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** Okay.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Duration.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** So it's just gone quickly.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:13]** Yeah.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** Like the damage.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:15]** Right.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** The burn damage stays.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** It's like a splash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Yeah.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:20]** This crazy splash happens.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:21]** Oh, that's good.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:22]** That's good.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:24]** Okay.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:29]** Orvier is going to step over and the Wisp ally will follow him.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:34]** Orvier is going to step over to behind this box, giving him some cover.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:55]** at least half cover as he steps between this box and the uh the void crier behind him and he is going to take another shot with his railgun at colin let's see if colin can stand it colin that's a 31 to hit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** Does that hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:02]** I think it does.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** It's 15 points of damage, dude.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** 15 points of damage.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** Colin's mama didn't raise no ****.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:10]** How are you feeling there, Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** He feels great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** He feels great?

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:13]** That's awesome.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** I love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:20]** He staggers back for a half a step and then stands a little taller than he did just a second ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** Okay.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** Okay.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:24]** Okay.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:24]** Amazing.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** Dr. Okay, what do you do?

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** You're in the hallway.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:32]** And the feeling that you need to get the fuck out is gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** Yeah.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:38]** Dr. K is going to be like, what came over me just there?

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:42]** I better get back in this.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:48]** But before he does, he's going to ask Bernice, like, what's going on?

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:50]** Okay.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:56]** And tell her to do an analysis on the laser and the trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** Okay.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:01]** Yeah, if you want to do that, you can... Do you want to do an analysis?

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** I mean, you've already seen it, so do you want to try and disable it?

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:06]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** Give me an engineering check.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Bernice is standing right next to it.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:11]** Yeah.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:15]** The briefcase goes in again to disable the trap.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:19]** That was a 20.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** Dirty.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** A dirty 20.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:24]** 16 on engineering.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:32]** I imagine her going in, trying to get through it, and you are... R2-D2 style.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:41]** I think there's some sort of jolt, and she was on the right track, and she doesn't pass.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** She's very close, but she doesn't pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:57]** all right yeah um and i think for this i've probably taken uh i forget the term but like where she can do two actions so she's actually gonna move back it's the full okay

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:01]** And her movement, what is her movement?

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:03]** 25, okay.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:05]** So she's going to go back into the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:05]** Okay.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:11]** She starts walking back past Effecta, rolling it back, rolling it back, trying to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:14]** I'm trying to select the right thing, so I don't.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** Yeah, no worries.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:22]** And Dr. Okay is going to move up because he has just one action that he can do.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:24]** So he's going to move up to the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:24]** Okay.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:25]** Sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:26]** And that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:29]** Dr. K moves up to the hallway.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:31]** Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:31]** Sounds good.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:32]** I like it.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:33]** I like it.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:36]** Okay, Colin, it is your turn.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** You have been hit.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:41]** You've been hit twice now.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** There's a lot going on.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** What are you thinking?

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:46]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:48]** Colin's all back.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** What does Colin do?

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:52]** Rick is just staring at you now.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:55]** And whispering, fall back.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** Fall back.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:59]** What does Colin do?

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:09]** Every follicle of his being wants to run up on Orvier Pike and f***ing end him.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:10]** Yes.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** Cooler heads will prevail.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:14]** Do you want to roll a d100 for that?

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:14]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Sure.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:19]** Feels like it might be a good time to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** You're pretty incensed.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** I don't know, man.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** Fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:26]** Oh, he took it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:26]** Oh, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** I'm so angry.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:34]** Try you.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:34]** Try you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** 50 plus.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** He falls back.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:40]** Anything less than 50 and he springs the trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** Goes for it.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:41]** Here we go.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:45]** Springs the trap and kills us all.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** Lose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:46]** 49.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:46]** 2.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:47]** 12.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:50]** 12.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:50]** Right?

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:51]** That's 12.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:53]** Oh, yeah, you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:54]** It's 12.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:57]** Either way, it's less than 50.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:59]** It's less than 50 either way.

**[00:56:59 - 00:56:59]** It might be two.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:01]** It's two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:01]** It's just two.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:04]** It's a confident two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:24]** it's a there must have been something about dr nodens like one last thing that you saw that reminded you like maybe her hair just stopped changing from keniko's hair back to the white of dr nodens and whatever reason you had what why did i do this reasons out the door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:30]** When Reptoids change, do their scents, like the smell of them, also change?

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:32]** They can change everything about them.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** Is the last waft of her perfume?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:35]** Sure.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** It finally just hit you.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:39]** You're going to move up to Orvir?

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:44]** You are going to run through, and you... God, you're going to kill everybody in the room.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:44]** I love this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** Oh, my God.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** Let me tell you what happens.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:53]** I hate my personal restriction to letting the dice tell the story.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** Yeah.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** I'm so sorry to the rest of the cast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:00]** Okay, but let's just set up the room for the listener.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:04]** The hallway now is jam-packed full of everyone.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:09]** It's literally from the top to the bottom is...

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:21]** Yeah, it's Bernice, then Dr. Okay, and then one block over is Here's, and then there's Effecta and Rick all within the doorway into the hallway.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:25]** And then there's this laser line that cuts diagonally across.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:28]** And the Wetzel has moved up to be close to that laser line.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** It hasn't crossed it.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:31]** And that's what Colin just sprinted through.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:34]** Colin lost his s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:40]** Onto the seemingly innocuous floor space that is grid-shaped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:46]** Presumably the landing area for the next ship in the hangar bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:50]** Colin, let me tell you what happens.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Colin, let me tell you what happens.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:58]** I like the idea that you caught a scent of Koneko for a second and it just incensed you.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:03]** Colin, I need you to give me a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:05]** Will save!

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:07]** Will save!

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** How do I put this in the notes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:19]** This is so accurate because his, his like sense of will is probably quite diminished right now.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** He's got a 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:22]** I mean, yes.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:26]** Oh, this is good.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:28]** This is good.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:31]** Colin, you run.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:39]** And as soon as you cross that laser line, you were running there and the scent of Keniko was going out of your nose.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:47]** And as soon as you crossed it out of your nose, like you were losing it.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:52]** And as soon as you cross that line, something, oh, it got stronger again.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:56]** And you're like, yeah, I'm going to keep going.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:58]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** I can smell her perfume.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:00]** I know it.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** It's right there.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** And you look up.

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:07]** And it's no longer Dr. Nodens there.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:08]** You see Kaniko.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** And she is entangled there.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** And she's like, help!

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:14]** Colin, please help!

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Oh no.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:25]** As you are under the effect of a time loop spell in which you see and react to events that no longer coincide with the current timeline.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:33]** You are now confused for one round and entangled for

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:44]** Two rounds as the spell goes off because Rick 19 and effecta and here's and Dr. Okay.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** You see that those lasers stop.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:54]** The spell has been or the trap has been triggered and Colin runs forward and is just like starts to slow down for a second and is like you just see his eyes.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:57]** I mean glaze over his body clearly slows down.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:07]** Colin, I need you to, per the spell confusion, roll another D100.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:18]** And before you roll it, I need to know what's going to happen next week, because that is our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:23]** Man, I got all these tactics in my head, and I'm going to forget them by next time.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:24]** Well, then write them down.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:25]** Write them down.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:26]** Throw them in the notes.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:28]** Because he's trying to find them.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:29]** Hmm.
