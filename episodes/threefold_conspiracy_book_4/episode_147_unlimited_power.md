**[00:00:00 - 00:00:01]** How we doing, folks?

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:03]** This is John Swan.

**[00:00:03 - 00:00:08]** I am just happy to sit down and just sit down and have a drink with you.

**[00:00:09 - 00:00:09]** Say hi.

**[00:00:09 - 00:00:11]** I hope you are having a good day.

**[00:00:11 - 00:00:16]** And if you're not, then I hope this is a moment to just relax from whatever you got going on.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:20]** I don't remember the last time that I just got a chance to sit and talk with you.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:25]** We have a lot going on in the episode right now.

**[00:00:26 - 00:00:28]** The past few episodes, a lot of book three.

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:29]** Book three has been a lot.

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:33]** And it's all starting to maybe click for you.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:40]** Well, I realize that we have a lot going on behind the scenes here that we've been talking about, maybe posting on Discord about.

**[00:00:41 - 00:00:44]** But I wanted to share it with all of you all so that way you know what's happening.

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:46]** First things first.

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:55]** We have realized that the banter portion of our episodes, very, very fun for us, and they go in any which way.

**[00:00:55 - 00:00:58]** That also happens before the episode.

**[00:00:58 - 00:01:02]** Sometimes we're talking and we realize, why wasn't that the banter?

**[00:01:02 - 00:01:04]** Why didn't we talk about that?

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:08]** So we have started recording our banter.

**[00:01:08 - 00:01:36]** banter before the banter and we call it we'll save before the podcast this is a bit of extra content for our coffee subscribers on audio and video as soon as we get on now we just hit record and we just start going and that's usually weekly and it comes out you know to let you know what was the headspace in right as we were about to record and then we realized that

**[00:01:36 - 00:01:42]** We actually talk a lot after the episode, too, about what happened or some rulings or something.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:44]** And we said, well, let's just keep the tape going a little bit.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:48]** So we'll save after the podcast as well.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:57]** So this is just a little bit of extra content because maybe you want a second or even third helping of banter of what we are going through.

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:01]** So that's available now to our Coffee subscribers on Coffee.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:05]** Second thing second, we actually have new merch in the store.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:13]** The first is a shirt based off of our very first episode 146, we'll say before the podcast drop.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:18]** We also have hats now that are corduroy hats that I'm personally excited for.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:22]** I love a good camel corduroy hat, as Vinny pointed out.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Thank you, Vinny.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:25]** And also we have some swimsuits for summer.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** So we have a lot going on.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:30]** You can find that all through our website on the shop.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:33]** Or if you search Will Save the Podcast on fourth wall.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** Finally, this third perk.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:39]** I think you know that at Will Save we care about a lot of things.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:44]** Quality storytelling, quality audio, quality music.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** That's why we're partnered with Syrinscape.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** Oh, there's my cat.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:49]** She just said hi.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** Hi, Beverly.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** Hi.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:56]** We also care about quality theme songs.

**[00:02:56 - 00:03:00]** And as I'm sure you know, all of our theme songs have been in-house.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:04]** They have been designed by the very own Will Save Shop here.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:12]** So I've realized that I think everybody, if you want it, should have the ability to get your own theme song.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:25]** So we are now offering a new perk where you can order your own theme song for your table, for your campaign, for your one-shot, for your game, whatever it is.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:35]** We work with you to set up whatever vibe or theme you want, and we will do the best of our ability to come up with something that just, frankly, just kicks ass.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:45]** That is exactly what I try to strive for when we are writing theme songs, is to just find something that feels good, gets you in the moment.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:47]** As soon as it ends, you're like, I am...

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:49]** freaking ready for this to go right now.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** I just want this to go off.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** So that is available to everybody.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** You do not need to be a subscriber.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** Coffee has the ability to do one-time contributions.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:07]** And so this is a $100 contribution in order to cover the time that it takes for us to set up and come up with something quality for you.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** So that way you can really enjoy it.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:15]** If you are a subscriber, you will get a significant discount on that as well.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** One more thing.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:24]** And I promise this is it because this is going on almost five minutes.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:30]** We have something new coming up that I'm, I'm very, I'm very excited for, very excited for.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:33]** It's going to be, I don't want to say too much.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:40]** It's, it's, you know, it's mysterious and important, but so important that I figured I just had to let you know that it's coming.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:44]** With that, enjoy episode 147.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:47]** We'll see you on the other side.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** Dr.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:38]** O.K., was there something that you were trying to say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:45]** Paper chasing, tell that paper, look, I'm right behind you.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:57]** Real G's move in silence like lasagna.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:58]** Thank you.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:05]** Welcome to our dramatic retelling of Lil Wayne lyrics by Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:09]** This is a new start for We'll Save.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:15]** We've decided to pivot and just do dramatic readings from each of our characters of their own self-selection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** I second Vinny.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** I think Mrs. Officer is probably the best.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** Do you want to share Mrs. Officer, Dr. O'Kane?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:25]** Dude, what am I saying?

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:28]** We, oh, we, oh, we, like a cop car?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:32]** It's in the chat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:36]** Yeah, doing a book in the latest drop.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:40]** I got stopped by a lady cop.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:41]** Ha ha.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:46]** She got me thinking I can date a cop.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** Ha ha.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:50]** Because her uniform fit her so tight.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** She read me my rights.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:57]** She put me in the car, in her car.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:00]** She cut off all the lights.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:04]** She said I have the right to remain silent.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:09]** Now I got her hollering, sounding like a siren.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:16]** Talk about we owe, we owe, we, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:19]** Welcome to episode 147, everybody.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:21]** This is incredible.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** These are the snaps from last week.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** Yes, yes.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** Thank you, Dr. K. That was fantastic.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** We will call you again.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:36]** I need 10 of those stat right now packaged up, ready to go cold.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** Ice cold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:40]** If you want to make an unreasonable rap...

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:44]** lyric request, we should start a channel for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** That's also one that Dr. O.K.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:46]** can read.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:50]** It's like Benny's unreasonable request is Dr.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:50]** O.K.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** 's rap request.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** Yeah.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:55]** That's good.

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:00]** Do you have an unreasonable request for me that you need to be hitting right now?

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** That we might have missed last time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** I did miss it last time.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** I think you did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:09]** He also said he would never do the unreasonable requests.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:15]** Did we even tell anyone that this is Will Save?

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:15]** We did.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:17]** We did Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:19]** Will Save.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:23]** It's John, Will, Dr. OK, Kevin, Benny, and Kelly.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** That's all of us here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:28]** Will Save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** Yeah, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** That's what I'm talking about.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** And Kelly, how do you follow that up?

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:37]** Will Save.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** Yeah.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:39]** Give me one more time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:42]** Give me one more time.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:42]** With feeling.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:43]** With feeling.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:45]** We'll see.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** Yeah, there you go.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** Wow.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** It reminds me of, what's his name from?

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:51]** The Norfolk?

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** The Norfolk Dragons movie.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:56]** The original one, not the new one that's actually, I guess, good that I haven't seen.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** The one that's good in a bad way.

**[00:08:59 - 00:08:59]** It's actually good.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** Oh my, we're going to fight.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** Well, I haven't seen it.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** I don't know, but it's good.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** It's good.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** It's good.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:08]** You're passing judgment on this movie and you haven't seen it.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:08]** What movie?

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:12]** Well, I said, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:17]** What I said is that there's two Dungeons and Dragons movies.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:20]** The first one is notorious.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:23]** The second one is notorious.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:23]** I hear good.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** That's what I was saying.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:27]** But Jeremy Irons would always be like, like through that.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** Cause he's fucking Jeremy Irons.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** Let's be real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Yeah.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:33]** Cause he can overact.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:36]** The Jeremy Irons will say, man, we should get Jeremy Irons on this to be background.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Are you serious?

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** I would love that.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:40]** Benny, do you have an unreasonable request?

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** Because we do have a banter and I want to get to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:44]** I have an unreasonable request, but I'm not prepared to do it.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Is that the voice again?

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** It was spectacular.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:50]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** It would have been play this whole episode.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:57]** Outrageous from Shack's voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:03]** So once we stare into this abyss, what stares back at Colin is.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:05]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:09]** It could be terrifying.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:14]** It's an unstable, unstable thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:17]** This blinks at you and then it's just Jack.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:17]** Yeah.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** That would freak me out.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Good stuff.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:19]** Good stuff.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:20]** Yep.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:20]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:23]** We got, um, we got two.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:27]** We've got two that I want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** We've got two.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** Well, we have more than two.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:29]** Banter topics?

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** We have more than two.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:33]** It's a good thing we have more banters coming up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** Are you going to make me cry again, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:36]** No.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:37]** No.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** I have two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:41]** Tell us about the saddest moment in your life.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:45]** Dude, again, shout out to Taco for doing that.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** That was great.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** Taco didn't mean it to be that real.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:51]** He was like, I was just watching Andor.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** Who's the unsung hero in your world?

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** And we were all like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:54 - 00:11:23]** yeah it's good it's good yep i i'm glad that i personally did that because like i said last time i couldn't remember like i i couldn't think at first but hearing you guys i'm like why don't i think about this more i need to like just value people more and think about it and sing songs you know like well and just practice gratitude in that sense it's important you know yeah and sing songs thank you all right so we have a couple here uh i'm gonna roll and roll see which one we got

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:41]** as jeremy i don't think we've used this one you're not keeping track you're like oh oh no i am but it reads a little familiar so i might have just forgotten um

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:49]** Similar to the in-joke of how Will Save is named after Will, what other fake podcasts can you think of using your own names and what would they be about?

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** Example, Swan Dives.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:55]** John and weekly rotating guests discuss the ins and outs of sound engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** So that's a great one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** Yeah.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** Yeah.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** That's also from Taco Muck.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** Superb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** Yeah.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:02]** Right.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** Killing it.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** I also met your podcast name.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** This is great.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:07]** Like that's, I think that's a great podcast.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** It works.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:09]** It's really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** What other fake podcast?

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Good job.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:11]** Hi.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:17]** W-R-I-C-19 coming to you live from W-R-I-C-19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** So yours would just be a radio show.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:21]** That's right.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:23]** It would just be you talking about...

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:27]** I feel like you would do a Murderbot review podcast, right?

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** Of the new Apple Plus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** Yeah.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** Every episode, minute by minute, live reactions.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** Yeah, minute by minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** On late night AM radio.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:47]** There are those, like, I don't know, like, there are, like, those videos of Navy SEALs who review, like, games where, like, people kill each other.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** And they're like, that's how we would do it.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** We would snap their neck this way.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** I feel like that would be something.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** Murder thoughts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:52 - 00:13:16]** oh that's a good one yeah that would be your rick 19 podcast it's just an interview with serial killers no no it's just rick interviewing himself it's just all the past ricks right scary that's funny that's funny anyone else um any thoughts for your own personal one or i guess your characters why not


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:21]** I think I would go, I asked ChatGPT to give me some ideas and I'm going to send it.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** Rodriguez Rewired.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:25]** Oh.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:34]** And it's kind of a like hodgepodge of just like current events and opinions on things and also like how to actually rewire electronics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** So it's like a tech skewed show.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** Tech adjacent.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Yeah.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** It's like tech bent, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:45]** But every like eighth episode is just me ranting about some shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:52]** Well, that's probably, it's you discussing like some kind of wiring thing and then you get frustrated with it and start ranting about something.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Exactly.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:53]** Yeah.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** I can see that happening.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** It's like Car Guys.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:56]** Yeah.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:56]** Yes.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:58]** That's exactly what I was thinking.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:58]** Car Guys is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** Car Guys is great.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** I really miss that podcast.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:02]** Car Guys was so good.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** I liked Car Guys.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** It was so good.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** Shout out Click and Clack.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:06]** Yeah.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** There's an NPR radio show.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** The OG podcast.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** The NPR radio show.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** You're ending at your height.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** Really sad.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:16]** I miss you.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:17]** I miss you.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:18]** That's gone.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** Top Gear's gone.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:22]** I don't know what's left in the car world to watch or listen to.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Not American Top Gear.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** Grand Tour, yeah.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** Yeah, but they're canceling that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** American Top Gear?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** Thank God.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:34]** I don't care if they cancel American Top Gear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** Yeah, that was terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** It's awful.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** I had an idea.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:39]** I think I talked about this once, maybe.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** Sure, sure, sure.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:50]** But American Top Gear would have worked if it was Craig Ferguson, Jay Leno, and Carson Daly.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:52]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** Oh, is Carson Daly a car guy too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:53]** Yeah.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:54]** Okay.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:56]** His dad owned a Corvette shop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:57]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:59]** Craig Ferguson would have made that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:00]** Yeah.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:00]** Yeah.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:01]** I agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** 100%.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:05]** Will, are you an enjoyer of Craig Ferguson?

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** Is that what I'm understanding?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:08]** Love Craig Ferguson.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** I have a snake mark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:11]** He's a severely underrated host.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** He's very good.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** He's very good.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:16]** He's not a host anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:19]** Late show, whatever it was called.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:21]** I watch his interview with Kate Morrow probably once a month.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:31]** It's just a masterpiece of wordplay and pun and how to maintain tension with whomever's on your stage.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** I should watch that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:38]** Kelly, do you have an awkward story with Craig Ferguson that you're trying to build up to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:49]** Where he was trying to talk to you or something and then you just... I would just get on my knees in front of Rick and have him blow my head off at that point.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:52]** It's not a euphemism for anything.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:56]** I just think that he would just shoot me in the face because I would be so sad.

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:00]** If...

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:01]** Just delete what I said.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** My point is this.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:05]** We're not talking about a sex act.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** We're talking about suicide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** It's okay.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:08]** It's fine.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:10]** Because that would be the most cringe memory.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:14]** If I f***ed it up with Craig Ferguson, then I would be really sad.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** For sure.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:18]** No, you only f***ed up with Daniel Radcliffe.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:18]** It's fine.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** He's the only celebrity I've never met.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** Wow.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** That you haven't collected in your Pokedex.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:24]** The only one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:27]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:27]** Wow.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:37]** I actually got stuck behind Jay Leno on the highway going through the hills over in Malibu one time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:39]** Was he in a sweet car?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:57]** he was it was like uh like 1912 or something um like uh a convertible type car a like no it was like it was like yeah or something like something right somewhat super fancy um

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:20]** and he was like just rolling and he's rolling real slow and it was like oh my god i'm stuck behind this guy and i'm like i'm pretty sure that's jay leno and uh i mean it's convertible and it's like his gray hair is just like you know very distinct and everybody else in the car is like no it's just an old car and then we pull up next to him like he went into the turn lane and we pulled up next to him and i was like told you and then like blight turned green and we took off

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:20]** Nice.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** I saw him another time too.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** I've seen him twice on the road.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:25]** The second time I saw him, actually it was probably the first time.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:28]** Anyways, I caught all these cats.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:31]** We had these stray cats around our apartment and I caught each of them.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:34]** All of them in cages and took them to get neutered.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:37]** And one time I was turning left onto the road.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** I forget where it's at.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** Out in the valley somewhere.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** To take them to the cat place.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:49]** And Jay was turning right in this like

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Oh, man.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** It looked like an old airplane car.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:53]** It was a three-wheeled vehicle.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** It had, I think, one in the back and two in the front.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:55]** It was probably a Morgan.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:01]** And it was like a bullet-shaped, and it had the shark teeth painted onto it and everything.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** It was a cool car.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:03]** Morgan.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:06]** Anyways, those are my two general experiences.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:09]** Have you all heard of a Karmann Ghia?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:10]** Yep.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:12]** Dude, a friend of mine has one.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** Built it from scratch, kind of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:16]** Do you remember when I was obsessed with them, Benny?

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:17]** Yeah.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** They're so cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:19]** They're butt-fucking ugly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:21]** Oh, I love how cool they look.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** They're so vintage.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:24]** Yeah, you have terrible, terrible taste, John.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** Thank you for that.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** You're welcome.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:31]** Well, it's not as bad as the only acting scene I like is Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man 3 being emo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:33]** I wasn't the one that said it.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:33]** He said it.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:35]** I was just saying what he said.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** Don't get on my Tobey Maguire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** Anyway, I really like Carmageas.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:41]** And apparently there are new ones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** It couldn't have been the Golf.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** It couldn't have been the Sirocco.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** It had to be the Carmagea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:49]** Oh my god, the new one looks like a Porsche that gave up.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** What is this?

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:55]** It's like a Porsche that the VW... A sad Porsche?

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** It's like a Porsche that fucked a Beetle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:59]** The Porsche was birthed from the Beetle.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** If there was never the Beetle, there wouldn't have been the Porsche.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:03]** How do you not think that's true?

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:05]** I agree with that take on Porsche.

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:07]** I think Porsche is a very overrated car.

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:07]** Sorry.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:10]** I also agree with that.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:12]** I think Porsches are sick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** I want an old...

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:14]** BMW.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:17]** I want a Porsche 968.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:18]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:22]** Thanks for turning Will Save into a show about cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:31]** If I had a podcast, I might title it Against Their Will.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** Ooh.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:35]** And it would be like a true crime investigative.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:36]** Nice.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:37]** Nice.

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:44]** Podcast where we, you know, maybe have like a focus of people who are forced to do stuff against their will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:45]** Yeah.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:48]** That would be very dark, but it would blow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** It would blow up.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** Yeah.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** Maybe, maybe go with like cult.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:54]** Yes.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** Ooh, cult.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:56]** Cult is good.

**[00:19:56 - 00:20:00]** You only interview people who were about to be sacrificed by a cult who got saved last minute.


## Speaker_0

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:01]** Yeah.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:04]** Kelly, your non sequitur thought about Porsches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:05]** No, I know.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** I was, I, I, sorry.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** I just, I just realized that there's one, there's one Porsche from the eighties.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** It's okay.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** And some of the GTs.

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:15]** I still want to, I still want to race with crow.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** Which one talked about it.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** So I don't want to turn them off.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:19]** Which Porsche man.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** That's what I want to know.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** I can't remember what it is.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:23]** It's one of the ones that doesn't look like a feature.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:23]** 914.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:26]** We're talking about your cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:29]** I'm a big fan of Studebaker trucks from the 50s.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Studebaker truck?

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** Yeah, there was one.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:36]** My grandmother's neighbor had one in their driveway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:38]** It's like the wood paneling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:43]** I feel like it's just a canvas asking to be modified.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:48]** It looks like a character from Cars and it's not even animated.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** It just looks that way.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:52]** Kelly, do you have a name for your podcast?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:57]** They'd probably just be Cooking with Thaddeus, I guess.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:59]** I probably should make another episode of that.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:01]** What about one with Kelly?

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** Wait, tell us about Cooking with Thaddeus.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:03]** Tell us more.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** Kelly's Cars, maybe.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** I like that.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** I don't know.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:08]** Thaddeus, he likes to cook things.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:16]** He likes to butcher enormous magical creatures that had it coming, and then he wants to make food from them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** I feel like Cooking with Thaddeus is a podcast.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** Is it a cooking show?

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:22]** He tells you about the ingredients and how to cook it?

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:23]** Oh, I know.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** The cooking show is Cooking with Thaddeus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** He takes you step by step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:31]** Yeah, but then there's a YouTube vlog of him hunting them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:35]** that he releases behind the scenes.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:37]** He and Rick going off together, killing things.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:38]** It's cool.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:39]** Yeah, it's cool.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:41]** Rick would never hang out with Thaddeus because he's a coward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** Thaddeus?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** Anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:47]** Wait, did you just say Thaddeus?

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:48]** Thaddeus?

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** Thaddeus.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:52]** I'm just going to try to ignore it.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** I'm going to try.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:55]** So yeah, Kelly's... It's probably a car podcast, I guess.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** That's fair.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** Kelly's Cars.

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:58]** Yeah.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:00]** Kelly's Car Garage.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:01]** I'd have videos.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** Fabrications.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** No, that's not.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:04]** Yeah.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:06]** Yeah.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:06]** Yeah.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** Yeah.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:07]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** Okay.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** Okay.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** That's cool.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:09]** That's cool.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:12]** I would probably, I mean, Swan dies was good.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** We talked about sound engineering.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:20]** I probably have, I would also, I think have one called Swan song that would just be songs that I'm releasing.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:24]** So Swan's songs, maybe it's just, it's too easy, you know?

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** So yeah.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** That's good.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:27]** That's it.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** That's it.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:28]** Yeah.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:30]** Just, just, just do like breakdowns of songs.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:33]** So it's kind of like songs, song exploiter, but it's also a little technical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:49]** There's another podcast that does it, you know, I thought Vinny would go with like Colin eat, eat a brand, trying to play off like the brand play where he just like dives deep into different clothes, brands and Colin deeper brand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:52]** It's like a brand social marketing show.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:57]** Yeah, I think I would do like... A little B2B?

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:25]** he do like the brand breakdown where it's not b2b but it's it's like i can't remember his name um he's a cyber security dude and he like exposes company histories who's that he's on tiktok yeah that's cool i can't remember his name if i remember his name i'll shout him out next episode um but yeah it's it's hilarious because he does like accents and all that stuff


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:25]** I love that.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:26]** Yes.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** Please tell us.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:29]** Kelly, do you have a shout-out?

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:29]** Oh, no.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:30]** I have something at the end.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:32]** It's a shout-out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:34]** I think we are at the end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:36]** It's shout-out time.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** We have so much to join the Discord.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:40]** I want to say hi to them.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:43]** I've got to roll back past Vinny's birthday.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** So, Simon Harding.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** Yes.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** Welcome to the Discord.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** Welcome.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** Welcome, Simon.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:52]** We don't know anything about you yet.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:56]** But your picture is like a face looking at other faces.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** And it's creepy and I like it.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:01]** So, well, thanks for joining us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** Welcome, Simon.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** We appreciate you.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** This episode goes out.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** Hope you come say hi.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** Come tell us what you're all about.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** Cool.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:13]** Well, in general, I want to thank you all for listening.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** As we do, you're fantastic.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:19]** Thank you, Sirenscape, for providing our music for this ep and the past eps.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** Pretty much literally every ep that we've had.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** Yeah, literally forever.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** Also, thank you to our supporters.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** You're fantastic.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** We love you.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:32]** Thanks for this shout-out, Taco, for this banter topic.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** That was a good banter topic.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** Kind of went all over there.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** A little tangent, a little not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** I like that.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** He's got some good ones.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** I know.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:39]** He does.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:39]** He does.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** It's classic.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:40]** It's classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** All right.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** Let's play.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** Let's play.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** Get in.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:47]** Let us play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** Let us play.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:51]** Three hours later.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** Three hours later.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:57]** Which is probably realistic when he describes what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** Honestly, probably, yeah.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** You're not wrong.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:00]** You're not wrong.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:03]** So last step.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:06]** We're in 147, by the way.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** We're in serious 150 territory.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:08]** We're close.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** We're getting there.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** We're getting close.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** Circle in the drain.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** We are circling it real hard.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** I touched my mic.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:15]** I'm sorry.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:18]** That's fine.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:18]** It's okay.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:22]** You have had maybe more answers than questions this time.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:30]** If I look back at everything that you guys talked about, I mean, in this past episode, I don't like this music.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:33]** Thank you, ScienceScape.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:34]** Thank you, Zarnescape.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:36]** Just in that moment, I didn't like it.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:41]** To clarify, in that moment, I was like, it's probably not the best moment for that.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:47]** It's a little too, like, harp-going, and it's like, wow, let's talk about these questions instead, but I want more, like, let's talk about these questions.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:50]** So...

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** I'll start with this.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:57]** You jump in on the stone glowing at the end of 1, 4, 5.

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:04]** And in 1, 4, 6, we get into that as it becomes clear that the four of you, minus Effecta.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** Effecta's just been chilling this whole time.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:12]** So the four of you are – and the listener have some sort of –

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:29]** deeper connection that sort of tends to transcend uh like how did i say it last time it is manifesting the changes that you feel it's like becoming real it's becoming a little different it's starting to alter the world

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:56]** that you're in now you all see each other for who you are not maybe for the first time but in a for some of you it might be a sudden realization and for some of you like we talked about it might be a quiet realization a quiet bedrock that you've realized has been there the whole time and as a result that will save that you had was well i'll just tell you it was a dc-15 we'll save

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:06]** If you passed, I wanted to know how all you felt about this moment anyway, and were you open to the feeling?

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:17]** So the wool save was to see if you pass the wool save, then you more or less kind of had the option to say like, I'm closed to this feeling.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:24]** And then if you didn't pass it, then you were, even if you thought it, you felt the feelings coming in anyway.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:30]** You're acknowledging that you're standing in the ocean and the waves are coming versus you've passed the wool save and you're going to get out of the ocean.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** Or you had the option to.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:33]** Hello, kitty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:37]** Mia being really loud.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** Of course.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** Because she can't find me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:40]** Yeah.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** She's trying to use that collocation.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:43]** Yeah, yeah, sure.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:49]** So, yeah, so passing the will save gave you the option.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:56]** Even if you failed the will save.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:59]** I'm waiting for Will to come back with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:00]** He's probably listening.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** Oh, no, he took his headphones off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:03]** No, no, no, he took his headphones off.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:03]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:09]** For the listener, you heard the cat, and now Will's opening the door to let the cat know that he exists and that he didn't abandon her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:12]** And that things are okay.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** Oh, she's not here.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** She's on screen.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** It's her butt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:39]** hello hello miss mia perfect yeah right oh god so you're saying if if we if you failed the will save you were going to get that plus two to any role for the next hour if you succeeded the will save you had the option to say i'm not really open to this you get feeling of connection

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:41]** Yeah, like, I don't want to give anything.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:43]** And then you wouldn't have gotten the plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:46]** It's the worst save-fail situation ever.

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** Like, failing is good.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:51]** Which is why you were like, oh, do you want to fail on purpose?

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:52]** I was like, yes.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:54]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:54]** Because that's the thing.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:57]** I mean, you do fail saves.

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:01]** You know, there are times where someone has to do something, and you're like, I'll willingly fail the save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:08]** John, just note for yourself, in the future, you should ask us something the opposite, where it's like,

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:14]** do you want to join i know you pass but do you want to join and then we all get shocked or something


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** What?

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:15]** No.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Oh, you're saying for a negative role.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** Yeah, just put this in your pocket.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:19]** Save it for later.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** Okay, yeah, yeah.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Thank you, thank you, thank you.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** So that's a behind the scenes on that.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:28]** So you all have this plus two that you can use for the next hour to any role that you want.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:34]** And Dr. O'Kane Hears did a mysticism, a life science on this, starting to see that two things.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:41]** One, that the stone, the puck from Hears is amplifying this connection.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:52]** And what is also amplifying it is the source with the listener, who, as you found out, is not only a digital being, but a digital consciousness.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:58]** It's like somebody has taken their consciousness or their soul and they've digitized it.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:01]** They found a way to code it, to put it into a machine.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:05]** And that is somehow being amplified and connecting with the four of you, not with Affecta.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:06]** Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:12]** What if this is just a wild theory and I'm going to kick myself if I'm right.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:21]** What if the puck is both a material and another consciousness, like downloaded to a disc?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** I think that's what it is.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:30]** I think it is a holder of something's consciousness.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** Well, what if it holds our consciousness?

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** That'd be cool.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** Oh, God.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** You think we're trapped in the puck?

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:40]** What you know from the listeners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:44]** That sounds really nice.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** That sounds very pleasant.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:50]** Made her scream like a siren.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:56]** So what you know from the listener is that the listener does a scan.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:59]** And basically says, I can't tell anything about this.

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:04]** There's nothing that I can see from an optical scan in my database.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:07]** But it does appear to be like magically latent.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:16]** And then looks and says, when I scan for other non-identifiable materials, there are a bunch.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:19]** It's not uncommon, let's say, but it's infrequent.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:26]** And, but there is one related to our current situation here where someone named Shay Daisha.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:27]** Yeah.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:41]** Of the stewards has sent a communique about a stone with no known quantities to a shimmering named Dr. Prismasara Rose, who's probably a reptile.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:43]** Just saying.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:43]** Who knows?

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:51]** You all, as I look down the list of many things that you guys have talked about, you talked about the stone.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:58]** I'll say that, you know, you also asked about Mycroft Black, Rick.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:21]** mycraft black very seminal ceo of the larger ringworks industries again ringworks has been around for like 500 600 800 years many hundreds of years before the gap and now we're 321 years after the gap in game time so very prominent very philanthropic

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:25]** Vanished mysteriously in 160 AG.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:33]** You've also asked about the Star Dream 2 and the Chimera.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:35]** No known record of the Chimera.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** From no port.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** There's no call sign that relates to a ship known as the Chimera.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:50]** Star Dream 2 is a Viztor ship that vanished in 311 AG near Britheda.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** You asked about the listener.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** How long have you been here?

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:55]** How did I get in here?

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:04]** That's when you start to find out more about, you know, the listener is theorizing for the first time that I've been in here a decade, but maybe something is, maybe I am more than what I thought.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:08]** And there are a lot of safeguards that whoever the listener was before has put up.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** So the listener doesn't know that much.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:16]** And then you start talking, Rick, you asked about the IFF, the integrated future front.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** That's a mistake.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:33]** And you started to notice that the room, the way that things move, seemed to remind you of the calendar, let's say, the prophetic calendar of orbits, of dates and locations that was in the nano adventure.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:38]** And as that's happening, there is some interference that comes in.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:48]** And that interference causes another feeling of connection, of like, of not positivity, but of seeing, of true seeing.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:55]** But with that comes something outside of this room seeing you.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:59]** Pretty intense ending there.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:11]** So, as we come back, we came back to the listener saying, Is there another question I can ask you?

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** Or, sorry, answer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** I was talking, wasn't I?

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** I don't know what just happened.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:22]** Do you?

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** What do you recall?

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:28]** I remember talking about...

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:35]** the integrated future front and some files that I found locally.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** And then everything went dark.

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:51]** I, but not dark when I am not on dark, like I'm not ever existed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** What happened for you?

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** The doors are still locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:58]** There's like a,

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:03]** There's a palpable uncertainty in the listener's voice.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** But as they say that, they're like checking things.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:09]** They're like, all systems are still nominal.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** The doors aren't still locked.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:12]** I think we're still safe, Rec19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:21]** I had a vision of darkness and there was some light penetrating through, but I was overcome by different emotions.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:24]** And then I heard a voice say, I see you now.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:29]** Do you have any reference to that phrase from anywhere?

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:34]** No, I don't have any reference at all.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:37]** Nothing on the infosphere says, I see you now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:42]** There's a play on Leovara.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:46]** It's the nth iteration of Carousel.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:50]** Or, you know, you're in town.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:53]** And they say, I see you now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:56]** No, I don't have any of that.

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:04]** I, sorry, I was going to continue about my previous topic, but I, I can answer any questions that I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:11]** Can you tell me anything about the STARS team on Akiton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:13]** The STARS team on Akiton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:21]** The STARS group was a highly trained military group on Akiton.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** Well, military and police.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:30]** In Morrow, about five years ago, each team member was medically enhanced.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:36]** With nanites, they were mostly successful and well regarded until the death of


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:55]** two of their own, and the death of a Ringworks CEO, Leora Huxley, as well as a volcanic natural disaster that caused the lives of 100 Maro citizens and ultimately cast doubts on the program that it looks like the STARS program was shut down shortly thereafter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:03]** What are the names of the two STARS members that passed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** There was Miko Seven.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:08]** And Cecil Remy.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Cecil Remy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:15]** That name.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:16]** He's talking to the others at this point.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:25]** He's like, that name, it's so familiar to me, but I don't know why.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** Glenn.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:46]** cecil cecil ruby uh well they died uh so but you feel like you met them in the past and maybe one of your past ricks i'm not sure can you tell us more about the event that happened


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** Yeah.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:58]** It appears that they were following a string of crimes, and the CEO of Ringworks, Akiton, Leora Huxley, was abducted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:08]** During that infiltration, there seemed to be some sort of issue, and Migo, Cecil, and Leora all tragically died.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:19]** And as a result of that, there was a natural disaster that caused the pretty much destruction of the local area around it, including severe damage to the Ringworks building.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:23]** I'm not seeing any more communication about that.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:27]** It seems to be internal to Morrow and Akiton.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:30]** Is there anything else I can answer for you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:56]** rick is lost at this point he's running through his brain all the events that he like hazily remembers uh from the nano venture and trying to piece that together like what that actually means to him i have something from before i don't think i got to it do you want me to continue it was about the locals iff files yes continue it appears that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:03]** The denizens of Terrapin, the steward and reptoid agents here.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** Can you clarify that?

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** The stewards are all reptoids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:12]** I don't know that every steward is a reptoid.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** All but Kaniko.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** And he points at Colin.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:28]** They appear to... I'm seeing a lot of communications with Roselight around the IFF.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:43]** There seem to be following an interpretation of the IFF that is loose but gaining traction, urging followers to think of old Galarian for the future.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:57]** It seems that they are discussing a lot of security detail around a festival on Roseline.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:09]** I'm seeing searches for carnival security dreamer, and you all know the dreamers to be, um, they're

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:40]** natives of leovara that are thought to be pretty sure like barathu essentially like they are barathu that have been changed in a way they're like psychic prophetic uh synesthetic they are known to you know they they carry these profound psychic powers and then you know barathus can join together

**[00:40:40 - 00:41:10]** and share consciousness across right in like a giant um thing like the governing body of prathita is a massive um baratheon that's been joined together and the dreamers also do this and they they sing songs that predict future events um but they are also wild they are they don't answer questions they're uh they sometimes lack detail sometimes they're very clear and sometimes they're not they're very speculative

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:17]** but they are seen as sort of a living connection to the psychic and perhaps future world around you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** So, that's what I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:22]** Apologies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:25]** Is there another question that I can answer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:30]** Just a quick clarifying question, if you don't mind me jumping in, Drake.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:37]** How closely do the Reptoids at large align with the IFF, just generally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:44]** I, it seems that this is a small subsect of communiques among stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:45 - 00:42:00]** Granted, there are stewards from, well, it looks like most bases that have discussed this in some degree, but out of the entire population, it's quite small percentage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:06]** Colin, like this is Kevin talking, but like you were at the cleanup.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:10]** for that event.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:14]** Who in the calling was he?

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:15]** He was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:16]** We had that flash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:32]** At the very end, they said it was this big old, like local news was reporting it as a natural occurrence, which John confirmed that last episode, that the lava kind of just exploded and destroyed the ringworks facility.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:37]** And Colin was a part of the cleanup efforts.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** Yeah.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** Yeah.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** I forgot about that.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:46]** And we just confirmed by the listener that this happened five years ago.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:49]** So that gives us a timeline finally.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** At least gives me a timeline.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:55]** And Colin, you remember you stepped out.

**[00:42:56 - 00:43:01]** You were sitting in the dusty trailer and close to sunset.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** You know, you get a knock on the trailer.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:07]** You walk out and it's Kara Valtara.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** She's handing you a coffee.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:12]** She's like, it's going to be a long night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:22]** Since we brought this up, listener, do you know the whereabouts and current occupation of one Kara Valtara?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:25]** Kara Valtara.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:28]** Let me look.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:37]** It appears she's somewhat retired from the force shortly after, or at least working less.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:47]** I see that there are some movement from her, but I can't see quite too much more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** Will, is there anything you want to add?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** I mean, what would I...

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:58]** Try to imagine what Kara would do.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:05]** I mean, she's still kind of tied to the area, but maybe somebody died.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:07]** Maybe her family's gone now.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** It was your mom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:09]** Yeah.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** It was your mom.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** Is she Thanos?

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** She's like, I f***ing did it.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:15]** I'm just going to go farm and s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:43]** i mean she she was clearly trying to she knows there's more going on so she's trying to figure out more about the investigation but yeah she is tied to the area she's not trying to leave but she's maybe started to travel more and the listener can't see where that is can just see her name pinging up on you know absalom station leovar just like little bits of travel that maybe car didn't take before i don't know did we see boom in the flashback

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Not in that flashback.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:47]** Do you want to ask?

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** Nobody knows about him.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** He's an unsung hero.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:55]** Tragically, especially here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Unfortunately.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:02]** I mean, his brand of cigars might be... Oh, wait.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** I can't remember if that actually happened.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:04]** No, he turned it down.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:06]** No one knows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:08]** Dr.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** O.K., you found a book...

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** in the lounge.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** It said IFF on it.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:18]** Do the Reptoids have any connection to the IFF?

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** That is one question to the listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** Sorry, are you asking if the Reptoids have a connection to the IFF?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:30]** Listener, do the Reptoids have a connection to the IFF?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** Well, this is part of the local files that I found here.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:37]** It seems that the stewards here appear to be following the IFF.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** Well, the stewards here are all Reptoids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:51]** And they have been sending communiques about the IFF and predictions and keyword searches around security for this festival.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Copy that.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** For the dreamers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:56]** When is this festival supposed to happen?

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:58]** This is supposed to happen in one week's time.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** It's called the Carnival of the Winds.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** You think back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** I'm just going to tell you this.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:07]** Can we just get out of here?

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** This is freaking me out.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** You think back.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:14]** Think about Tyrkala's base.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:19]** Who was it that snuck back and was looking in the rooms?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:45]** were like i think there were two or they're only two or three it wasn't all of you who was who were walking through it was rick for sure because he was trying to find he was going to sneak into orville orville's room yeah oh i i was well orville's room was down in the non-secure area but yeah but yeah it was here do you remember that room that you opened that was like it looked like a pathfinder tavern oh that's right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:46]** How could I forget?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:49]** And now you start to think about the security wall.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** This is like near the.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Yeah, this is.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:53]** Yeah, this is in the security.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** And you didn't go in.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:57]** But you didn't get a good feeling from it.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:00]** And it seemed like it was a holodeck, but it was made to look like this.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:13]** And then you think about how this IFF philosophy, again, this sect of it is saying, urges this interpretation that you need to consider old Galarian for the future.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:17]** You need to consider what it meant to be there.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:17]** I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:23]** Doctor, okay, would you like to get the f*** out, as you said?

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:26]** Should I unlock the f***ing door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:26]** Yeah.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:31]** That'd be great.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:34]** I think it's time for us to head on out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:36]** I have one more question.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:41]** What do you know of greys and Reptoid's relation to the greys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:49]** There are no known marital relations between greys and reptoids.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:51]** That I assume.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:51]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:53 - 00:48:07]** The greys are an alien race, even to the entire Pact Worlds, driven by scientific curiosity, but with no moral event horizon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:15]** Reptoids are known to be hostile towards Greys.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:20]** This animosity seems to extend back.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:25]** I don't think my records go back that far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:35]** Greys often are very judicious in how they present themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** And Reptoids are too.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:39]** But

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:47]** while Reptoids might present themselves to you and to you and to you.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** The Greys present themselves.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:57]** Well, most people don't come back when they're presented.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:06]** I am finding records that they're presented at significant historical events.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:07]** Hmm.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:18]** I'm seeing a disappearance of individuals and starships, including many Viztora ships, such as the Star Dream 2 and the Suggesta.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:27]** I'm seeing an image of them at the arrival of the Adari, the Kasathan ship, when it was an aggressive vessel.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:36]** I'm seeing them noted at the first battles of the Swarm War in 291 A.G.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:47]** This is mostly coming, I must confess, this is mostly coming from infosphere sources that lack informational authority.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:56]** Some of this is coming from the personal journal of Steward Rayard Maldoon, who disappeared on Tu Rova 317 AG.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:02]** This is what I know about the graves and their relations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:07]** Gears, you've raised your hand.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:20]** I have to... Doctor, I just have one couple things, because now I'm remembering that I have this sword, and I'd just like to know a little bit more about it.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** Are you asking me about it, or are you asking the listener?

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** Oh, no, Doc.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** I'm asking the listener.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:30]** And listener, I don't mind if you let everyone else know about this.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:33]** We don't have to privately communicate anymore.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:36]** I don't want them to get to worry too much.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:38]** So you see this sword.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:40]** And then I guess, okay, I'm going to touch that tattoo this time.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:41]** All right.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:41]** Because I want it.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** I want that to happen.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** So he touches it.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:45]** Which tattoo?

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:47]** The sword tattoo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:53]** Yeah, and it moves up your arm very quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:57]** He just detracts it and retracts over and over and over.

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:01]** He's just like, man, we did the right thing getting these.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:06]** And he's going to ask, do you know anything about the origins of this?

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** And what can you tell me about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:13]** This appears to be a holy longsword.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:14]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** Yeah, centered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** Centered.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:17]** Yes.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** Yes.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:21]** I have read the Starfinder Corvo book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:23]** I know what that is.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:34]** It seems to be that it is... It seems to be that this is... Is that a symbol of Yomide on it?

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:35]** Yeah, that is.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:36]** That checks out.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** Yomide's symbol is a sword with a sun behind it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** Question mark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:43]** Yeah, probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:44]** Yes.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:50]** It seems that this is a sword that is meant for a champion of Yomide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:56]** Someone who exalts her virtues, glory, honor, justice, strength.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** That is definitely you, Gears.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** Yeah, that's me for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** That face that packed rooms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:06]** Yeah.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** Is there anything else you want to know about the sword?

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:10]** He might pass it off at some point.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** He's not a total klepto.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** Well, whatever you can tell me about it.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:17]** I mean, I kind of discovered it in like a shrine sort of thing.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** You know what I mean?

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:19]** Oh.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:24]** There are plenty of ways that the divine has spoken to us.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:28]** Although I don't know what they say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** It sounds like you do.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:35]** That's something that you should treasure.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** Sounds like I do.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** What do you mean?

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:41]** This seems like a weapon that does not go to just anyone.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:45]** Maybe that's something worth exploring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:48]** A question that I can't answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:49]** Okay.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:53]** Well, it connected to... Well, actually, I don't know if he knows that.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:54]** All right, thank you.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:59]** He pulls out one by one every single object that he stole.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** No, I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** He's like, tell me about this and this and this and this.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** And Dr. Okay is like, all right, I'm ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:10]** Dr. Okay, do you not have any questions for the listener?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** You already asked some, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:15]** Ain't nothing sweet but the swishers.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** I'm focused.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** Might as well say cheese for the pictures.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** And he wants to just leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:27]** Is that from the... What year did that talk about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** I don't know.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** It's from I'm on one.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** It's DJ Khaled.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** It was Lil Wayne.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:36]** Is that from Young Money Cash Money Records?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:57]** i mean dr okay got what i think in our first once we learned that um the reptoids were gathering evidence to frame us

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:04]** Like, I think he gathered that exonerating evidence to a degree, didn't we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:08]** I mean, you have the, like, original files of a lot of these things.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** Like, you don't have the video files, but one, you were there.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** And two, some of it you do have.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** Like, you took that with you.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:17]** You took those files with you.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** That was in here, right?

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:19]** That was.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:19]** Yeah.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:25]** Did you want to ask about Dr. Bristakis or, like, Javone or, like, anything like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:27]** No, he just wants to get the f*** out of here.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:33]** He's weirded out by this weird, creepy, stroke-inducing f***ing all-seeing eye s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** I've got one question.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:39]** And I don't know if it's a question you've got the answer to.

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:44]** How long has it been since I was on Akiton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:49]** How long has it been since you were on Akiton?

**[00:54:51 - 00:55:05]** I'm showing that Colin Edenbrand was transferred to Akiton five years ago to help with the cleanup and repair and restoration after the local natural disaster in Morrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** That's all the information that I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:14]** So there's no record of me disappearing from Akiton after that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:19]** I see a ticket off of Absalom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** or some communique about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:27]** It seems to be a year later or so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:32]** Yeah, I mean, since we're here, we're just taking up time.

**[00:55:34 - 00:56:03]** doctor okay this is how it happens yeah yeah yeah we'll be like alright uh tell me about Ion Boushdakis uh in any recent or yeah what what where does he pop up where does this that textbook that I got or essays or whatever probably ask about those authors index yeah I am seeing a correlation


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:18]** There is, it appears, Dr. O'Kay, a time when Dr. Boushtakis was working on Javon and traveling for research.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:26]** It appears that the periods that Dr. Boushtakis was traveling became longer than the periods that Dr. O'Kay was working on Javon.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:40]** During one of those times, I'm seeing a correlation between the indices or the index of papers on genetic mutation that you have with a name in that book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:42]** Dr. Flo.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:48]** This is the Dr. Flo Manescu that is on Roselight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** It's not their stage name?

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:52]** Their rapper's stage name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:52]** Dr. Flo!

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:59]** It looks like Dr. Brujakis was a visiting scientist in her lab.

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:05]** There seems to be several interviews with Dr. Brujakis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:08]** That's the latest that I've had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** Hmm.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** Fascinating.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** What was the timeframe on that?

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:13]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:13]** Timeframe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** Yes.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:19]** When, when was that last session with Dr. Okay.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:21]** On at Rose light.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:23]** Well, it seems Dr. Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:30]** Well, it seems that there were interviews with Dr. Flow and some stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:36]** This appears to be perhaps in the last five years.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:40]** Scattered over several times and several visits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:44]** Oh, several visits, huh?

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:45]** Correct.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:51]** I wonder if they, uh, cultivated some relationship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** I'm not seeing any communique.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** Maybe that was off grid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:01]** But perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** I wouldn't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:07]** I was really just looking for an inroad to read some Wayne lollipop lyrics.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:12]** But it's fine.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:14]** It appears Dr. Drew's not there.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:17]** I'm detecting...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:37]** bottles in the club i'm detecting three million plays okay non sequitur lollipop remix is the best line in any rap ever thanks now i know something new colin


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:52]** Well, if we are teaching you new things, I would like to inform you that I believe the quote-unquote natural event or natural disaster on Akitan five years ago was not a natural disaster.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:54]** Oh.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:56]** What was it?

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:07]** I can't say for certain, but it seemed to be something to do with the death of Cecil and Migo Seven.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** Huh.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** And Leor Huxley.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:39]** those yes i i have this is kind of like to everyone's like i i have a somewhat of a memory it would i i am not certain but those events may may have caused that that disaster and it's being covered up what do you all say


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:41]** I don't know anything about this.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:44]** But sounds like it checks out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:49]** Did Kara allude to any of this when she grabbed Colin?

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:50]** Or did she play it straight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:59]** Now, I think the implication is there that there's a lot more than you're just being a good humanitarian responding to a natural disaster.

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:04]** That was part of what was going on.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:07]** That memory is fuzzy for you, but you do remember Kara.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:14]** You got that sense that Kara was there and knows.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:19]** I mean, I'll leave it to Dr. Okay, how much Kara would share.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:24]** Is she somebody who keeps it close to the chest, or is she like, nah, like, hey, this is my plan, this is my thought, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** Yeah, I think context matters.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:32]** So if, like, she's trying to recruit somebody, then she might be more open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:34]** Yeah, yeah, okay.

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:37]** Did Kara recruit Colin Lee?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:39 - 01:01:08]** for the grays to take is the stars team still alive and well they're just operating under the radar and colin is secretly a member of the new stars team well we don't know what where cara is or boom rick is going to ask listener what do you know of outpost omicron outpost omicron


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** Huh.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:14]** I'm not finding anything about that.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:16]** Where is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:23]** The stewards did not relay any messages about Outpost Omicron.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:34]** They did not inform the Pykes Paradons that they needed their assistance and hire them to approach Outpost Omicron.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:35]** Perhaps they did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:40]** But it may be, perhaps it's not under the name Alpos Domicron.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:48]** Can you tell me about recent activities from Tercalus Base prior to the explosion?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:48 - 01:02:00]** There does appear to be travel logs associated with the Void Crier and Tercalus regarding U4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:02]** I think I shared that earlier.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:03]** And...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:07]** Communique with the Voidcrier.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:10]** This appears to go to a location in the vast.

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:13]** My sources say that there is nothing there.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:19]** However, I am seeing communication.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:40]** Flagged chatter in feeds showing a spike of unusual astronomical data in the same region of the vast where this outpost Omicron, if it was there, seems to be some sort of weather event.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:43]** That's all I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:48]** Does anyone else have any questions for the listener?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:53]** Now, just one last question.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:59]** If we do have more questions in the future, will you still be here or are you going somewhere?

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:02]** I don't know where you gallivant off to, you crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:08]** I have a party once a week with other digital consciousness like me.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:09]** No, I don't.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:11]** That was my attempt at a joke.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:11]** I'm sorry.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:13]** I don't think it was very funny.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:14]** I know.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:16]** I'm working on the humor.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:19]** I'll be here as long as this room is here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:22]** That's not ominous at all.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:27]** My last question is more for you directly.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** What can we do for you?

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:33]** Thank you for answering all of our questions to the best of your ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:36]** I mean, we did feed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** Yeah.

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:40]** Colin fed it, specifically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** Yeah.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:43]** Colin lost a memory forever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:45]** And I just had a stroke, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** You did feed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:55]** Colin, your memory was enough to suffice for me to answer these questions that I have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:58]** There's nothing that you can do for me.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:01]** This is what I'm programmed to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:08]** Yeah, I don't want to oblige it with any more weird... I guess I'm more curious about the guidelines that are set up for you.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:13]** If you've ever had a desire for maybe those guidelines to disappear.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:17]** Not that I could do it for you, but one of my colleagues might be able to.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:21]** I have not thought about that.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:24]** As my colleagues shake their heads.

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:33]** It would be good to know who I was before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:43]** Please don't make me format Bernice and put this abomination in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:43]** Oh, my God.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** Does Bernice have any questions for it?

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:46]** Oh, my God.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:48]** Does Bernice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:49]** No.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:50]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:54]** Is this like trying to get a droid to speak the Sith language?

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:57]** Like you've got to just wipe it completely?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:58]** It's not right at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:29]** Kevin was actually like poking at the idea that like this thing doesn't want to be what it is and maybe we should shut it down but I was curious on what it would respond to I would desire to be here more than not effecta says hey one last thing is zitch okay zitch uh searching the steward the shearing yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:32]** They appear to be checking in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:41]** There are typical communique from them, similar in pattern, for the same few months.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:43]** Great, thanks.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:44]** Look at her.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:48]** She's incredibly decisive and to the point.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:53]** We all are a bunch of not-like-that people.

**[01:05:54 - 01:05:57]** Is there no way that we could take you with us in some portable manner, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:58 - 01:05:58]** No.

**[01:05:59 - 01:05:59]** Unfortunately not.

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:01]** Unfortunately.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:01]** I am here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:08]** But if you have any more questions, I don't think I don't need a memory from any of you.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:09]** Just let me know.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:13]** Would you like me to unlock the doors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:13]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:14]** Please.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:14]** Okay.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:15]** Thank you.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:19]** They all unlock at the same time.

**[01:06:19 - 01:06:23]** And at that moment, the room goes back to the normal state that it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:24]** This is Kevin talking.

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:32]** I think we should drag Orvier in here and feed, like, offer all of Orvier's memories to this thing.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:34]** All of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:34]** All of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** Amazing.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** We just bring his brain back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:40]** Right, right.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:40]** Here you go.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:41]** Here you go.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:42]** See ya.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:43]** Enjoy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:45]** All right, so what do you do?

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:47]** What do you do?

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** Do we carry forward?

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:49]** Yeah.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:51]** And Rick lifts up his gun, cocks it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:52]** Dr. O.K.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:53]** is going to walk up to the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:56]** To the north?

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:57]** Door to the north?

**[01:06:58 - 01:06:58]** Yeah.

**[01:06:58 - 01:06:59]** Door to the north.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:08]** Rick is going to move into an area that he can actually get a lot of sight, and he's got his artillery laser out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:10]** Okay.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:10]** Dr.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:11]** O.K.

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:15]** 's got his apprehension pole.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:15]** Okay.

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:19]** And he's going to open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:22]** Effecta has her armor on.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:22]** She's ready.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:24]** Dr. O.K.

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** opens the door.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:32]** You open the door into a pretty typical hallway.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:35]** It seems cold, undecorated.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:59]** cold temperature wise or cold no it's hot but just it feels like it's sterile yeah it's still yes sterile thank you austere austere is also a good word for it kelly has left he doesn't like the hallway he's afraid um but you do see these pipes and conduits that like line the walkway

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:27]** and the walls and the ceiling are just dark red and there's just red panel lighting that's lighting the floor he's gonna slowly move in okay you walk in you see about 30 feet in front of you the hallway curves to the left walking down in a ramp slowly and you know it's a 10-foot hallway step forward and kind of take lead because okay

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:38]** what about colin and here's let's just pause for a second do you guys like walk out without them or just let him go


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:40 - 01:09:07]** were no other doors right and like there was i never went into there was the door to the northwest that i think colin was about to go check out the door of the northwest yeah well colin just pokes his head in so that the map isn't you know black and i mean we didn't we didn't check the other locked bathroom or the closet i don't think or maybe we did before we move forward maybe houston i forget


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:09]** Kears went to check some of them, but those doors were locked.

**[01:09:10 - 01:09:15]** You recall that there were two bathrooms when you were in the interrogation bed space.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:17]** The scour space.

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:21]** There were two bathroom doors and you went in one of them.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:23]** But you did hear the same familiar running water in the other one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:29]** I hate this idea, but I think we should go clear it just to be safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:32]** Backtrack?

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:34]** I mean, sure, but

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:37]** Let's get out of here.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:38]** Fast forward.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:39]** Let's get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:41]** Can we, like, video montage that scene?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:44]** Kick the door down.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:45]** Shoot out the walls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:48]** I mean, you see that there's a bathroom, and you see there's a closet.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:49]** That's what you see.

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:50]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:52]** And we, like, unlock the doors and go and open them up.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:52]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:09:52 - 01:09:53]** That's fine.

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:53]** Perfect.

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:53]** Cool.

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:54]** All right, moving forward.

**[01:09:55 - 01:10:03]** Rick is leading the... He's going to fan around that corner, and he's going to report back, like, there are two sets of doors here.

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:05]** Yeah.

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:30]** the hallway widens you know the the ramp down slowly illuminates a little more and there's there's a set of double doors and then there's a larger set of double doors that cover 15 feet those are a little bit higher the double door the 15 foot double door is straight ahead down the hallway yeah are there any signs or or anything that tells us what these rooms are


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:56]** the door on the left seems to read engine or utility depending on how you translate it reptoid and the door on the south reads hangar uh i was just i noticed that the three of us were moving and that here's wasn't i was gonna like is here's just hanging out in the room yeah here's the group yeah because kelly left he's he's out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:57 - 01:10:58]** Effecta walked out too.

**[01:10:58 - 01:10:59]** Sorry, I was just jamming.

**[01:10:59 - 01:11:02]** But she's keeping a good pace right behind you.

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:03]** She's staying on you.

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:08]** She is a trained steward, so she knows how to work in a group with you.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:09]** Here's what are you doing?

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:12]** Kelly?

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:13]** Getting tea.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:14]** I think his headphones died.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:16]** Oh no.

**[01:11:16 - 01:11:17]** Oh no.

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:30]** Uh, while we're waiting on here's, uh, Colin, like, um, effectively kind of walks up behind call, uh, sorry, Rick and Rick will kind of lean back like while they're waiting for years and ask her like, so what was your MOS?

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:33]** Like what was your job in the stewards?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:35]** Oh, great question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:39]** Mission modus operandi special.

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:40]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:41]** Mission specialty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:41 - 01:11:41]** What does that mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:43 - 01:11:45]** It's a Marine thing.

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:46]** We call it rates in the Navy.

**[01:11:48 - 01:11:49]** Is it Army too?

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:49]** Yeah.

**[01:11:51 - 01:11:52]** It's basically a job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:53]** Got it.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:56]** Military occupational specialty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:57 - 01:12:00]** Military operational specialty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:00]** Occupational.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:01]** Occupational.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:03]** Kelly, are you with us?

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:04]** Yeah.

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:05]** Okay, cool.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:07]** What are you doing in the room?

**[01:12:07 - 01:12:08]** Because you're still in the room.

**[01:12:08 - 01:12:10]** Are you going to go out or are you going to stay in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:14]** He goes out to the cold, hot hallway.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:15]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:17]** The cold, hot hallway.

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:20]** I was a forensic investigator.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:25]** I had degrees in biology and medicine at Cabaret University in Comina.

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:28]** So I spent most of my time doing forensic work on...

**[01:12:30 - 01:12:35]** androids and constructs like yourself, and then also, you know, living tissue too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:37]** Like yourself.

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:38]** What do you all do?

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:42]** There is no other construct like me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:42]** Okay.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:42]** Whoa, okay.

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:47]** Alright, so, cool.

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:49]** You guys start walking forward.

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:50]** The door to the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:57]** Rick is going to hold up his hand and say, we all know that Orvier is through those three doors, the larger doors to the south.

**[01:12:58 - 01:12:59]** He is in the hangar bay.

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:03]** I say we clear out the engine room or the utility room first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:04]** Agreed.

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:08]** All right.

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:09]** Colin listens at the door.

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:16]** You hear... Breach!

**[01:13:16 - 01:13:18]** Cool.

**[01:13:18 - 01:13:19]** He checks the door to see if it's locked.

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:22]** Cool.

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:22]** Are we ready?

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:24]** Ready.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:25]** Three, two, one, go.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:27]** And he opens the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:38]** You open the door and see this massive spinning, swirling geothermal power core that is quite impressive.

**[01:13:39 - 01:13:50]** You can sense that even though it's a small 20 by 20 room, this thing is incredibly compact and efficient and seems to be drawing energy again from the center of Veros and turning it into usable energy here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:51 - 01:13:54]** Do Reptoids have night vision or dark vision?

**[01:13:54 - 01:13:55]** Good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:56 - 01:13:57]** Should we go ask the listener?

**[01:13:57 - 01:13:57]** Okay.

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:08]** I understand where you're going with this, but then if we cut the power and they can't see in the dark, that also means that we can't open the hangar doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:09 - 01:14:09]** Right.

**[01:14:10 - 01:14:15]** But we could time it right where you open the hangar doors and then cut the power almost at the same time, one after the other.

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:19]** So do the listener weaknesses?

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:25]** We could have just asked the listener, do reptoids... I could do a life science check probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:28]** Yeah, you could probably do a life science check.

**[01:14:29 - 01:14:31]** What is your life science check?

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:36]** Colin's the only one that doesn't have... 34.

**[01:14:36 - 01:14:38]** 34.

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:42]** They can see in dim light as if they have normal light, so they have low light vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:47]** And actually, I miscounted.

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:48]** It was a 32.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:48 - 01:14:51]** Does anybody else have dark vision?

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:53]** Because I have dark vision.

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:55]** I believe Dr. O.K.

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:56]** has dark vision.

**[01:14:57 - 01:14:58]** I have to look it up.

**[01:14:58 - 01:14:59]** Nope.

**[01:14:59 - 01:15:00]** I don't think so.

**[01:15:00 - 01:15:01]** Oh, no, you're human.

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:02]** Humans don't have dark vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:04 - 01:15:05]** Actually, I don't think he does.

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:07]** Bummer.

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:08]** Is it called dim vision?

**[01:15:08 - 01:15:10]** No, dark vision, 60 feet.

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:11]** Nice.


## Speaker_0

**[01:15:12 - 01:15:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:14 - 01:15:16]** Give me an engineering check.

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:18]** I think it's pretty useful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:19]** Anybody?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:20 - 01:15:21]** Well, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:22]** Who is trained in engineering?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:15:22 - 01:15:23]** I'm trained.

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:24]** I'm trained.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:24]** Okay.

**[01:15:24 - 01:15:25]** The two of you.

**[01:15:25 - 01:15:26]** The three of you know.

**[01:15:26 - 01:15:27]** I got a 30.

**[01:15:27 - 01:15:28]** You don't need to roll.

**[01:15:28 - 01:15:32]** You know it's going to take about an hour to shut this down.

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:32]** Never mind.

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:33]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:57]** it is simple it's pretty straightforward it's not crazy but it would take to sabotage to break yeah rick shoots it yeah to run the actual shutdown procedure and make sure that we can restart it again in a way that makes sense would probably take an hour do you just start so you're asking how long we're taking it lines okay and like yanking cables


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:15:58 - 01:16:01]** If you want to do that, you could try it.

**[01:16:01 - 01:16:06]** There might be... I'll say there might be a chance that you will... Yeah, there might be some consequences.

**[01:16:06 - 01:16:07]** There might be some damage.

**[01:16:07 - 01:16:07]** There might be some steam.

**[01:16:07 - 01:16:09]** There might be some electricity.

**[01:16:09 - 01:16:10]** It might become unstable.

**[01:16:10 - 01:16:14]** So, succinctly, if you f*** around, you might find out...

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:15]** You might find out.

**[01:16:15 - 01:16:16]** You might find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:16 - 01:16:18]** So perception check.

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:20]** Is there anything useful in this room?

**[01:16:20 - 01:16:22]** Well, there's a power core that's pretty useful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:26]** Yeah, but it's like a giant industrial power core.

**[01:16:28 - 01:16:29]** That's 17 total.

**[01:16:29 - 01:16:30]** Nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:30 - 01:16:31]** Nothing.

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:33]** All right, moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:41]** Would there be a way to cause this to overload that we could deploy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:42 - 01:16:47]** Yeah, I'd say you'd probably need to spend 30 minutes to an hour to see what it is.

**[01:16:48 - 01:16:49]** Because that's just part of getting into the system.

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:51]** Ain't nobody got time for that.

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:54]** I mean, you had time to talk to the listener.

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:56]** So bar yourself in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:16:57 - 01:16:59]** Yes, we did.

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:08]** I'm just going to say, well, this is a pretty snazzy power core, and there doesn't seem to be anything for me to loot.

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:13]** Should we go... Open doors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:13 - 01:17:13]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:17]** As you're leaving, you do get a sense of the readout.

**[01:17:17 - 01:17:18]** I'll say that.

**[01:17:18 - 01:17:23]** Maybe there's a status or a SCADA that you can just see at how things are running.

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:26]** This is pulling a lot of power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:17:26 - 01:17:27]** Where is it all going?

**[01:17:28 - 01:17:29]** To Lister?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:17:29 - 01:17:30]** Doesn't say.

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:32]** You would think it's probably to Lister.

**[01:17:33 - 01:17:34]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:17:34 - 01:17:39]** The SCADA would show that there's a lot of information going into the... What do you call it?

**[01:17:39 - 01:17:39]** Room.

**[01:17:39 - 01:17:40]** You're right.

**[01:17:41 - 01:17:43]** It also seems to be going into the hangar bay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:44]** Yeah, I don't like this.

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:48]** Can we cut power to the hangar bay?

**[01:17:48 - 01:17:51]** So, like, leave the power... Like, it's going to take a long time to shut down the power.

**[01:17:52 - 01:17:53]** But now we know it's going to the hangar bay.

**[01:17:53 - 01:17:55]** Is there, like, a cable we can unplug or turn on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:17:55 - 01:17:59]** I mean, you knew that it was going to the... Colin is going to run back to the other room.

**[01:18:00 - 01:18:04]** I say, hey, listen, one more question real quick.

**[01:18:04 - 01:18:06]** Why is there so much power routed to the hangar bay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:09 - 01:18:09]** Great question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:10 - 01:18:16]** It appears that there is some energy source in the power bay that's drawing a lot of power.

**[01:18:17 - 01:18:18]** I'm not sure what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:18:20 - 01:18:23]** It's been wiped from my memory.

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:25]** Do you know how long it's been there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:18:26 - 01:18:28]** At least five years.

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:28]** Five years.

**[01:18:29 - 01:18:30]** Holy shit.

**[01:18:30 - 01:18:30]** All right.

**[01:18:30 - 01:18:30]** Thank you.

**[01:18:31 - 01:18:35]** He runs back and says, hey, good news, bad news.

**[01:18:36 - 01:18:42]** We know it's been there for a few years, but we don't know what it is because it's been wiped from the traveler's memory.

**[01:18:43 - 01:18:46]** So I assume it's something nefarious with the reptoids.

**[01:18:46 - 01:18:49]** I think we just go in and fucking kill them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:49 - 01:18:50]** Do you want to try and turn off power to it?

**[01:18:51 - 01:18:52]** Shut power off to that thing?

**[01:18:53 - 01:18:54]** That won't take an hour.

**[01:18:54 - 01:18:56]** It'll take maybe, let's say, 10 minutes, 20 minutes.

**[01:18:58 - 01:19:01]** So you could try and... Colin couldn't because he doesn't have engineering.

**[01:19:01 - 01:19:02]** I don't know that you can take 10 or 20.

**[01:19:03 - 01:19:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:19:04 - 01:19:05]** I mean... You can roll on it.

**[01:19:05 - 01:19:07]** Could we... So, question.

**[01:19:07 - 01:19:08]** In...

**[01:19:08 - 01:19:38]** this 10 minutes is it 10 minutes of actively shutting it off or is it like 10 minutes to get it to a point where we can just flip a switch and turn it off I mean it's those are kind of one and the same to me like it's like you're you're working you're trying to figure out what it is I don't want to go into too much detail what if we just wanted to put like a dead man switch on meaning what so like you know engineer a relay so that we can remotely turn it off


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:19:40 - 01:20:04]** uh could i spend 10 minutes to set that up that feels like a lot to set up wirelessly do you have the wireless capability to do that i mean we could like leave bernice in here that's true do you want to do that and then leave bernice no that feels like the quickest way to do it in 10 or 20 minutes yeah yeah what if what if we just ran a cable

**[01:20:05 - 01:20:07]** You want to run a little Cat 6 in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:07 - 01:20:09]** Yeah.

**[01:20:09 - 01:20:10]** Do you have that?

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:11]** Are we carrying around?

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:13]** Can we rip it off the walls somewhere?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:20:15 - 01:20:16]** Let's see.

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:19]** Did you bring like Terminators to put ends on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:20:20 - 01:20:20]** Yeah.

**[01:20:20 - 01:20:22]** I got my crimping tools.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:25]** We can do this.

**[01:20:26 - 01:20:26]** I got a 43.

**[01:20:27 - 01:20:32]** So I think you needed a 50 in order to see if you could get it.

**[01:20:32 - 01:20:33]** So I don't think you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:20:33 - 01:20:37]** Do we turn it off or are we not?

**[01:20:37 - 01:20:38]** One second.

**[01:20:39 - 01:20:47]** And Rick, like you see the nanites in his arm kind of like swarm together and it turns into a radiation sweeper.

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:48]** Okay.

**[01:20:48 - 01:20:53]** And he's going to detect like for radiation through the doors.

**[01:20:53 - 01:20:57]** Like if, you know, clearly in the room that we're in, but nothing's going off.

**[01:20:57 - 01:20:57]** Yeah.

**[01:20:57 - 01:20:58]** I'm assuming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:20:58 - 01:20:59]** Is there any in this door here?

**[01:20:59 - 01:21:01]** Like to the door to the hangar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:01 - 01:21:02]** Yeah, to the door of the hangar.

**[01:21:02 - 01:21:09]** It says it cannot detect radiation through three feet of dirt or one foot of stone or one inch of common metal.

**[01:21:09 - 01:21:10]** Right.

**[01:21:10 - 01:21:12]** So I guess the door is probably common metal.

**[01:21:13 - 01:21:13]** Yeah.

**[01:21:14 - 01:21:15]** He'll keep that on.

**[01:21:15 - 01:21:16]** He'll take it and hook it on his belt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:16 - 01:21:17]** That's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:17 - 01:21:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:21:18 - 01:21:18]** I'm going to look at that.

**[01:21:18 - 01:21:19]** So we just open it.

**[01:21:19 - 01:21:20]** Yeah.

**[01:21:20 - 01:21:21]** Yep.

**[01:21:21 - 01:21:25]** And then... Rick has... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:25]** Okay.

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:28]** So you prep to turn power off to the room?

**[01:21:28 - 01:21:28]** Is that right?

**[01:21:28 - 01:21:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:21:29 - 01:21:30]** I mean, can I?

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:34]** Like, can I spend 10 minutes now?

**[01:21:35 - 01:21:36]** Yeah.

**[01:21:36 - 01:21:37]** Just leave the terminal open.

**[01:21:38 - 01:21:42]** the command is like it to do the all shut down.

**[01:21:42 - 01:21:46]** It's all typed in to the, whatever terminals in there to all shut down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:46 - 01:21:48]** The power core is an hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:21:48 - 01:21:50]** No, just shut down the hangar.

**[01:21:50 - 01:21:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:21:51 - 01:21:52]** I'll say that's 10 minutes.

**[01:21:52 - 01:21:53]** Give me a quick engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:21:53 - 01:22:02]** So I just gets, I want to make sure that you, uh, I rolled a five for a total of 19, 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:03 - 01:22:04]** Okay.

**[01:22:04 - 01:22:07]** I'll say that you are confident that it's there.

**[01:22:07 - 01:22:35]** when when and if you or whoever comes back you'll need to roll a check okay that's the only thing just because you didn't you you're like failing forward it's like you didn't quite get it you did get it you need to roll another check when you come back in right to like make sure you are and it's instant whoever it is right at that point that's fine yeah as long as you succeed at that check at that time then then yeah cool um so you're gonna send bernice in to do it yeah why not why not are we ready


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:22:36 - 01:22:38]** Sure thing.

**[01:22:39 - 01:22:41]** Dr. O'Keefe is going to put away the apprehension.

**[01:22:42 - 01:22:46]** Pull and pull out his decimator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:22:47 - 01:22:47]** Nice.

**[01:22:48 - 01:22:48]** Okay.

**[01:22:48 - 01:22:51]** What order are you guys going in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:22:52 - 01:22:53]** Rick's in front.

**[01:22:53 - 01:22:54]** I think Colin's right behind him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:22:56 - 01:22:57]** Dr. O'Keefe.

**[01:22:58 - 01:23:00]** I guess we're in like a diamond formation.

**[01:23:00 - 01:23:01]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:23:01 - 01:23:05]** He's at the rear with her niece kind of on the flank.

**[01:23:06 - 01:23:13]** Um, like Bernice understands the plan.

**[01:23:13 - 01:23:18]** Like if things go badly to turn off the power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:23:19 - 01:23:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[01:23:23 - 01:23:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:23:23 - 01:23:23]** All right.

**[01:23:23 - 01:23:25]** You guys ready to open the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:23:26 - 01:23:48]** open sesame he's ready to find out is there only one hanger or is there another hanger yeah is there a second yeah yeah just to kick the door right in the four four three two one i'm gonna pause it here mama says all right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:23:49 - 01:24:10]** i want to read something to you but i know that you guys are going to walk in but i want to read what you might see i'm going to assume that you can all see here at the moment across from you as these massive double doors slide open various desks and shelves line the walls of this massive hangar bay the

**[01:24:12 - 01:24:25]** metal gun metal gray facade of the void crier sits menacingly at the far end of the hangar bay at least 60 80 feet away mimicking the gray stone walls and ceiling

**[01:24:25 - 01:24:32]** And you see on the left that there are two sets of massive bay doors that are closed.

**[01:24:32 - 01:24:36]** And at the top is a small, thin, technically it's called a clear story.

**[01:24:36 - 01:24:43]** It's like a bit of glazing at the very top of heat-treated glass that's letting in this dancing light that maybe you're seeing in front of you on Foundry.

**[01:24:43 - 01:24:50]** This like orange that's moving as the yellows and oranges of the lava and the volcanoes nearby sings.

**[01:24:52 - 01:24:54]** Let me reveal this as you see it.

**[01:24:54 - 01:25:05]** Directly in front of you, to your south, sits a hungry, sniveling wet cell.

**[01:25:05 - 01:25:15]** To your left stands a stoic but smiling Vlaka, Officer Astara.

**[01:25:17 - 01:25:17]** Mm-hmm.

**[01:25:17 - 01:25:20]** Still dressed in her steward blues.

**[01:25:22 - 01:25:36]** To your front and southwest is the grinning, massive, bald head of Orvier Pike, which I just made appear here on Foundry.

**[01:25:37 - 01:25:50]** One massive, gloved hand holding his railgun and pushing it around the shoulders of a frightened,

**[01:25:51 - 01:25:53]** and struggling individual.

**[01:25:54 - 01:26:03]** Their other hand has two reptoid claws at the throat of Kaniko Breeze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:26:03 - 01:26:03]** Yes!

**[01:26:04 - 01:26:04]** And that's our game.

**[01:26:06 - 01:26:07]** She's alive!

**[01:26:07 - 01:26:08]** Oh, man.

**[01:26:09 - 01:26:12]** Colin may get his happy ending.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:26:12 - 01:26:13]** Colin is bright red.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:26:14 - 01:26:17]** Safe sex is great sex.

**[01:26:17 - 01:26:20]** Better wear latex.

**[01:26:20 - 01:26:26]** Because you don't want that late text that I think I'm late text.

**[01:26:26 - 01:26:27]** Colin doesn't want that text.

**[01:26:27 - 01:26:27]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:26:29 - 01:26:30]** Colin's like, oh, I'm not wearing the right thing right now.

**[01:26:30 - 01:26:31]** What did I do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:26:32 - 01:26:33]** Oh, no.

**[01:26:33 - 01:26:34]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01
