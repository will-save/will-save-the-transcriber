## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:21]** Hello friends.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:21]** Welcome to my channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:27]** Ah, welcome to episode 145 of We'll Save the Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:33]** That intro was specifically for Venny, his favorite noise in the whole world.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:35]** Yay.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:36]** What noise is that?

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** The one where you're like... Yeah, that one.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:41]** Yeah.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:41]** Oh, no.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:41]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** It's fine.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:45]** It's fine.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** It's cool.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:46]** It's cool.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** It's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** All right.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** Two things here at the top.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:53]** One is our actual banter, our continuation from last week.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:57]** And the other is just a blanket statement that I think we can all agree on.

**[00:01:58 - 00:02:01]** The blanket statement is that Fritos are better than Bukles.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** I think that's really clear to everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:05]** And then the banter topic.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:07]** Yep, I got a lot of nods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:08]** Thank you, 1,000%.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** There's no discussion to be had about that at all.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:14]** The real banter topic is...

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:20]** What was your first CD that you ever bought?

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** Brought to you by the mind of Will Garrett.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Is that a question to me?

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** No, it's also a question to you.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:30]** I'm just crediting you for coming up with that great banter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** Will should answer first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:35]** Wow, the first CD was sold in 1982.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:38]** Yeah, that drives.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** I didn't realize they were that old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:40]** Get it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** I feel like I remember buying cassette tapes as a kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** Yeah, but it wasn't popular.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** It just existed then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** I'm really trying to rack my brain.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** I'm trying to remember what my first CDs were.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:58]** And I know, honestly, Bad Hair Day was up there and one of my first five.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:03]** I also had the Godzilla soundtrack, which was actually pretty good.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** I mean, soundtracks.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** Ballflowers.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** Soundtracks are a thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** Yeah.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** Yeah, I remember buying them.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** It wasn't my first, but it was one of my first.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** It's like your favorite director's mixtape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** I think that might have been the one I bought.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:17]** I had a Smashing Pumpkins CD.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Melancholy and the Infinite.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:23]** But the one that I can really remember making a choice for

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** And I don't remember what it was.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:28]** I think it was through a magazine or like some online thing or something weird.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:33]** You got to pick two songs and put it on a CD and they would print it for you and send it to you.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** But the song selection, there was only like 10 songs to pick from.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** And I was like, I don't know what these are.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:40]** But one of them was Robbie Williams, Millennium.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:41]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:45]** They mailed it to me and I opened it up and there's a CD with only two songs on it.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:47]** And I don't remember what the other song was, but I remember Robbie Williams.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:48]** I love that song.

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** Go listen to it if you haven't heard it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:52]** It's fun.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:52]** Wow.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:58]** I remember the crazy thing you wrote into a magazine.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** It's like Columbia.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** I don't remember that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** It was something like that.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** It was something weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** Yeah.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** And they would send you stuff.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:11]** I just remember going to Best Buy and walking into the CD selection.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:17]** And I think, like I said last time, the CDs were in this plastic thing that was like three feet long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:23]** And the only like giant anti-theft device.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** So you couldn't put it in your pocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:29]** So yeah, so you can put in your pocket, but you could swing it at somebody because it was heavy.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** It was like a club.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** It was like this plastic thing.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:36]** One of my first CDs, not the first, was the original Matrix soundtrack.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** Same.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:42]** And I remember that's how I was turned on to a lot of those bands.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** I just didn't know.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:45]** And I was like, this is phenomenal.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:56]** Um, and I remember before you would put in music to work out, I remember having either like my Walkman or my Sony or like something and putting it on and then going to work out.

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:00]** And I would like do that to like, cause I was doing a lot of martial arts at the time.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]** So I'd play that and then like practice my katas.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** It was like, Oh, it was like so fun.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:08]** It's like just like a vibe to like put on music and be like, I'm going to like do this.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:29]** um but my actual first cd was a lot less cool but i still like them as a band uh it was hansen's cd it was the orange and yellow cd with the three of them sitting in like the woods and yeah not the one with umbop on it though that that you know no that was that was oh that wasn't it yeah okay wasn't the album just called umbop

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** It might have been called Mbop.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:36]** It also had Weird on it, which was this interesting song that I learned on piano, and then I played it in my music class.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** And I was like, this is a cool song.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:38]** Middle of nowhere?

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:39]** Middle of nowhere.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** I thought it was that.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:40]** Yeah.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** What a time.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:42]** Yeah.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:43]** Yeah.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** They're a good band, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** All bought at Best Buy.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:46]** Yeah.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** I think they're pretty decent.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** I still think they are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:49 - 00:06:13]** they're pretty good i i let my kids listen to bob because it's like a it's there's nothing you know bad in the song so they were a one-hit wonder for no reason at all like they should have been more successful they had a copy or they played that song money on that album and then i later listened to a live version of it and granted i haven't listened in a minute so i don't know if it's still good but at the time i remember being like it's a pretty banging version of like

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:43]** money like that was like for for like a pop trio like they did the song justice i was like it's pretty cool you know they came out with another album in 2024 they did i haven't listened to it yet i remember them pop like showing up on the radio and i was like yeah all right they still got it this is good for them yeah i mean they're good they cut their hair though so it doesn't count yeah that's not as cool they they should keep their hair well it was what zach isaac and uh what was the other brother i don't remember


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** Anybody else?

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:54]** My second album that I purchased was Lifehouse's self-titled album.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** Their first one.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** It was a good listen.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:01]** I had bought it on tape and then I bought it on CD because it was that good.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:06]** I also like that album.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:11]** My first one was sort of an underground indie cut with a ridiculously long name.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:35]** um it was uh bugles are indubitably better than fritos every day all day all the time yes i think that album doesn't exist i remember that oh yeah i don't know i don't remember that it's a good take yeah yeah yeah yeah kev if i'd seen that i would have cleared the whole best buy aisle of it just thrown it on the ground and stepped on it broken all of them


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:43]** wow it's messed up man yeah the rage yeah no i can't definitely make room for bugles it's like they can coexist


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:44]** Can they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** Terrible man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:49]** It's kind of like the bark Mr. Pibb.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** Mr. Pibb's cool.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** What's it called?

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** Revere War?

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:53]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:57]** It's like Mr. Pibb and... No, A&W and Barks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:02]** Yeah, like they're always in the same machine and I don't think they've ever spent a dime on advertising.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:04]** But they can never put them next to each other.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** They have to be on opposite sides of the machine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** Yeah.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** Because they'll fight each other.


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:12]** Because...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:15]** I mean, they are, you know, they're beers, technically, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:18]** And I dislike both of those equally, because I don't like root beer.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** You don't like root beer?

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** As an adult, I agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:23]** It's kind of lost its... Specialty root beer that tastes awesome?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** Yeah.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** What's a specialty root beer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** Like, I don't know, like, crafted?

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:31]** There's, like, a Vermont... Like Moxie?

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** Like a Sarsaparilla?

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** Yeah.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** Or, like... Sarsaparilla?

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:35]** I mean, I...

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:36]** I don't know.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:39]** They just have stronger, better, creamier.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:40]** You can get whatever you want.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** Moxie's really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:42]** It's hella strong.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** That's really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:45]** I would try them.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:45]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:46]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:46]** I like Barks.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:51]** I can't drink Barks because it knocks me out.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:52]** What?

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:57]** I'll drink a root beer, but then I have to go take a nap because it just makes me tired for no reason at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:59]** So that's your kryptonite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:59 - 00:08:59]** I guess.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** So now I know.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Much bigger fan of ginger beer.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:06]** I will drink ginger beer straight up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:27]** oh yeah didn't barks have like really good commercials they were like the red bull before red bull it had like a dog or something in it i don't remember yeah it's like a bulldog i think or something like that with like a barrel in his mouth um my first cd that i purchased with my own money


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:32]** was Counting Crows, August, and Everything After.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:35]** Dude, Counting Crows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** Solid album.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Great choice.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:45]** The one that I bought with my parents' money was, I think, a Mannheim Steamroller Christmas album.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** Mannheim?

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** Wait, I don't know this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** I'm not familiar with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** Wow.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** Steamroller Christmas?

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:55]** They were like, you have to get something for Christmas or whatever.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** I think I had that on vinyl.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** It's a neoclassical new age music ensemble.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:03]** Yeah.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** That's cool.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** I need to listen to this.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** I'll just have some Christmas in April.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** Makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** Just some Christmas vibes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:13]** Yeah.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** Kelly, what was yours?

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:21]** Well, my very first CD, for sure, was Smash Mouth's Astro Lounge.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** Yes!

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** I had that, too!

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** Yes!

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** Astro Lounge.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:29]** Looking at it now, I'm like... At the time, it was cool, okay?

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:33]** Like, I played the shit out of that CD for some reason over and over because it's the only one I had.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:34]** Come on.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:38]** And eventually my Walkman... Yeah, I had a Sony Walkman.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:41]** It was really good, the CD version, and it broke.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:44]** I broke a Sony Walkman of all things just playing Smash Mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:48]** I broke like so many portable CD players.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:53]** I actually got a mini disc player just so I can make my own mixes.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** Nice.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** Yeah, that's cool.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:59]** For a minute before I had a CD burner.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:21]** yeah yeah i remember doing that on my on my tower pc kids these days will never know what it's like to have a cd skip on you oh yeah that's the worst because mp3s don't do that no but mp3s have like weird compressions and yeah especially if you're using spotify which has quality yeah you know yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:27]** Or, well, they also might not know my first book of spells.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** Well, we don't because we're awesome.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:32]** But in general, the format that they sent over is pretty low compared to others.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:37]** But my first book of spells was my CD.

**[00:11:37 - 00:12:02]** you know binder that had like the four row on each side it's like and then when you ran out of space you would put cds double like yeah yeah yeah i remember that and then trying to carry that like in the car and reach for the cd yeah yep god forbid it melted yeah right the entire collection was gone yeah oh that was bad yeah i've never had that happen what florida

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** Yeah.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** Outside the car.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** Outside the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:25]** Well, speaking of things that are hot after going down that memory lane, you all went down some memories last time in the very, very hot Terrapin Station.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:28]** Pretty crazy.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** It's so hot right now.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** It's steaming like crazy, Abs.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** Oh, God.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** Florida Everglades.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:34]** It's so hot right now.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:37]** I'm standing in the Everglades.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** I just can't do it.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** I just can't do it.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:51]** Couple of reveals last time, some, uh, some re reveals and, and understanding some new clarity.

**[00:12:53 - 00:13:05]** got to sit down and chat with effecta crisscross applesauce, learn a bit more about her as a prisoner seemingly here at Terrapin.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:19]** She was traveling to tear callous to study with Dr. Aurelia Nodens and became caught up in whatever machinations they had and then was

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:46]** drugged taken to terrapin didn't even know that she was not in deer cows and started to be tortured have memories recounted pulled from her head said over and over again painfully using this this device that dr okay you had identified to be this like mind scour device to pull memories to extract them to start to like learn how to become someone else

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:54]** And she recounts a lot of this with some severe trauma that she's been through in the past few days.

**[00:13:56 - 00:14:15]** I think Rick 19, was it you who were in, when you went into Dr. Nodin's office or like the medical office, when you were first getting those first questions, those halcyon days of very chill questions from Dr. Nodin's when you first got there.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:19]** And someone saw something that talked about like a prisoner.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:20]** And I feel like it was you, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:21]** I think so.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:25]** I think I like pretend to like walk the wrong way or something.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:26]** Yeah.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** I vaguely remember that.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Yeah.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** It's probably in the notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:32]** Try me in the notes.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** Unfortunately, not recorded.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** No way to know to confirm.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** That's rough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:39 - 00:15:00]** true dr okay you're talking you take some of her blood i i have to ask would you in the moment analyze her blood and compare it with the reptoids that you had done i would just i would be analyzing it probably be stacked in a queue so i would have done the two reptoids first and then


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:01]** Yeah.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:06]** I mean, I think you would have seen pretty quickly that it didn't match any of the DNA markers.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** That was a, that was a pretty clear one.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** It was definitely different.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:19]** It was definitely an Android, but it's a certainly terrifying, uh, terrifying proposition at what they were doing to her.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:25]** And as you got into it and talking with Colin, revealing that Colin, well, you didn't say it was your sister.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:28]** Maybe you were just heavily applying.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:31]** So, but this person of interest to you, uh,

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:52]** might have suffered the same fate and they are not here so we don't yet know what happens to those who the reptoids are done with finished with so there's nothing from like the wetzel that um dr okay can surmise about prior origin they were previously a reptoid

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** Nothing else.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:54]** No.

**[00:15:55 - 00:16:00]** They were a reptoid that was... I mean, just by looking at the... I don't know.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:01]** I don't know the right terms.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** would.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:06]** All the parameters about the cells that came through.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** All the different shapes.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:19]** You think that whatever caused this change was like sudden and probably very painful to feel your body making these changes in a matter of hours.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** Overnight.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:20]** Hours.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:21]** Hours.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:22]** Hours.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** Hours.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:50]** everyone please close your eyes no i'm just kidding um uh we have plenty of time for that coming up um so yeah colin how how did you feel in that moment when she's like i didn't see anybody else here and it's this like realization that not only is cora yeah i don't know tell me i think it's one of those where he's not altogether surprised right the reptoids have not been sloppy about anything


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:56]** And so him asking if there was anybody else around was really just a shot in the dark.

**[00:16:57 - 00:17:02]** Like maybe if there's one hostage, there's more than one and they've allowed them to frat in their eyes.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:06]** But even like as the thought crossed his mind, it didn't make sense.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** Yeah.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:11]** And so it was one of those like, well, I'll find out.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:15]** But I have very little hope that this is going to go anywhere.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** But it's another confirmation.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:20]** Yeah.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:29]** That at some point she was here and I believe you saw a ring works logo on her stuff in the chest.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:35]** You are Dr. K is looking through the lounge.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:40]** You find this book that is the manifesto of the integrated future front.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:48]** Colin, well, Benny, you wisely called out that they were major players in the nano adventure.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:54]** And this book here, very well read.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:00]** And there's some connection happening between the Reptoids and the IFF.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:08]** And then there's another taunt that comes through over the...

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:33]** message from the comm unit from dr nodens saying dr okay i realize where i know you from i know you from dr bruzakis interesting because when was the last time that you were seen with dr bruzakis like like years years well i guess not years uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:37]** but like an out off world, maybe years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:38]** Yeah.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:50]** So she says, I know you and you are in her very cheerful tone as she does says, you know, like you will never amount to be anything that he was.

**[00:18:51 - 00:19:03]** I mean, you remember from reading her books that fell out of the, that was in the Suzer from before, you know, where you found these connections, uh, to, uh,

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:29]** was a there was another doctor written in the in the front of the book it was like a you know rel i would love to see you sometime uh there was a doctor who was on rose light and then in the in the pages as you were thumbing through learning these things there was a there's another doctor a dr flo that also was seemingly connected so there are there's these orbit of contemporaries to dr brujdakis

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:33]** And that in this field, they know each other.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:35]** They know Dr. Bouchdakis.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:44]** And it's like forming this ring of people that at least one has now seen you and knows you, Dr. Nodens.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:48]** Dr. Nodens knows Dr. Bouchdakis and knows other people who know Dr. Bouchdakis.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:53]** Starting to hone in on where is he.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:57]** Another fool to the conspiracy.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:12]** Cryo daemons house and it's yeah lives on forever the gift that keeps on giving how many Folds are left in this conspiracy Supporters how many slew I got left in you.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:45]** i'm channeling my brad pitt in glorious bastards


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:52]** He speaks the third best French.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:53]** I don't speak any French.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:54]** That's what I said.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** Third best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:02]** I was kicking Emmanuel Macron with my coffee.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:09]** So last time you all incensed by this taunt, by just the general sense of need to get the f*** out of here.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:12]** You said, let's keep going.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** It's kind of been the goal for a while now.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** Yeah, it's been a continual goal.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:19]** You didn't realize in book one, but then you needed to get out.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** And then in book two, you're like, we need to get out.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:23]** And then in book three, you're like, well, we're on the ship.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:23]** We need to get out.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** Well, we're on checkouts.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:26]** Our entire thing is getting out of places.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:28]** It's just getting out of places.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** It's tough.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** It's tough to get out.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** It's real tough.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** You found that out with your last fight.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** That was not an easy fight.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:37]** True that.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:40]** This time...

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:47]** You have entered, as we established last time, into a room full of alien tech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:49]** Nobody entered the room, John.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:52]** Semantics here, but it's important.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:52]** Yeah, that's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** We opened the door.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** You opened the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:00]** Into a room full of alien computers.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:01]** After a perception check.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:06]** And comms tech, two workstations on the east wall, three on the west.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** There's another double door across from you.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:16]** There are screens of view screens and data pouring through on different computers and screens around the room.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:24]** And there's a familiar hum of just processing power all around you.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:30]** The air feels cooler because they need to keep the place cool.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** So it doesn't have that same humidity.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:34]** Well, Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:38]** The floor seems to have some sort of indentation around it.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:43]** Is there a, can we like do a perception check on that without stepping on it?

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:44]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** Give me a roll perception.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** I got a 19.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** Okay.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** Rick, Rick and I team, but Dr. Okay.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:54]** Give me like a, either physical science or a maybe engineering.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:57]** I got a 34 on engineering.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:59]** 34 on engineering.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:04]** You are certain that this room has some other layer to it.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** It's like a box in a box.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:09]** There's something going on.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:11]** You don't know what.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:14]** I think I mentioned last time that there's one big light on in the middle.

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:17]** But there are a bunch of other lights in the ceiling and strips around.

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:20]** So this room has some other function.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:25]** And that floor, you think, is probably... Retracts away.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** It might retract away.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:29]** It might be an access hatch.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** It might be a number of things.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:34]** Just provide access into the void beneath the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:36]** It's like a mixed studio.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** It's a room built within a room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:39]** It's like a... Yeah, it's a box in a box.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:46]** Was this room... Was this addition to the room... Or this feature of the room, I should say.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:49]** We don't know necessarily if it was an addition, but...

**[00:24:49 - 00:25:09]** does it look like it was an addition like did the reptoids add this or did the stewards who initially founded the space there is no way to know there's no way to know i mean the reptoids have impeccable craftsmanship is what you're saying there's no way to know okay you you don't know how old terrapin is um okay yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:13]** So Perception didn't see any traps or anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** You don't see any traps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:16]** You got a 19, right?

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** 19, yeah.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** I'm positive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** You step in the room.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:24]** I feel like the doctor, okay, and I need to help out since there are computers in here.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:26]** So maybe we need to hold off on splitting up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:38]** So Rick steps in the room and he kind of, he's got his, um, uh, apprehension capture, pull out, but he 10 feet, 10 feet range.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:43]** And he, he, uh, but he looks back and he says that door down the hall does not lead to this room.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:45]** It leads to the room next to us.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** We should clear that as well.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:46]** We should.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:51]** Yeah, I forgot to mention there's a single leaf door off in the top left corner.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** Should we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** Yeah, there are two more doors down the hall.

**[00:25:55 - 00:26:02]** And it looks like the doors on the left side of that hallway lead down towards the other room.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** So it's probably on the other side of that bathroom.

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:05]** But there's another door that leads up.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:09]** And so I'll ping on the map.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** But in this far corner, there's another door.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:14]** That leads to probably the same room that the hallway door leads to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:17]** Should we set up a pincer motion?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:20]** That's fine.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:24]** I guess here we'll go that way.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** Which way?

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:33]** To the left to set up a pincer movement on this particular room, even though there's no one in there.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:38]** So he's going to do that and line up at that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:59]** okay and rick will move further in towards that other door we'll move into the room here's we'll open the door okay and rick move into the computer room colin and here's walk down to the other door that seems to be on the other side uh i'd like to take a perception on the two doors it is definitely locked


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:26]** okay there's there's a double double doors straight across the doors you just walked in and then there's also the door to the top left corner which is probably into the same room as the one that here's walking towards so i want to perceive for any like noises oh natural 20 for 29 29 you don't hear anything so is that a heartbeat yeah okay god dang it i was like am i playing a heartbeat yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:30]** Thanks.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:32]** I don't know how to set up the tension.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:33]** I appreciate that.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Heartbeat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:38]** Where's the effector?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Oh, my God, I hear it.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** Oh, apologies.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:40]** She didn't.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:43]** She's waiting in the back.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** No, I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** That stayed behind.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** She's letting the reptoids in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:50]** She steps into the hallway and you see her pull the pin on a grenade.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:55]** She's doing chest compressions on the reptoids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:58]** Susie, don't leave me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:01]** No, she walks in behind you into the computer room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** She just shoots her.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:05]** She's singing Sabrina Carpenter's Please, Please, Please.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:15]** So Rick steps up to the, the small door, the single door, not the double doors, um, that we're going to pincer move and he's going to check the door knob.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:16]** It's locked.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** It's locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:24]** Um, I will attempt an engineering to, I can assist or, or just handle it.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** Either one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:32]** Oh, I got a, I assist 18 plus two is 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** Plus two is 20.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** Yep.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** The door unlocks.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:39]** What do you do?

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Sweet.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:43]** Kick it open.

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** Kick it open.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:49]** You open the door and the room looks clean.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** Unused.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:55]** It's about 10 feet by 20.

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:03]** Looks like an office with an expensive wood desk with a high-backed chair, two smaller chairs in front of it.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:10]** There's a sitting area with a couch, and there's a curtain that can be, you know,

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** Portion off a bed.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:27]** That's right in front of you in front of the door Yeah again clean but unused the air here feels the same temperature as in the computer room cooler Rick will step into that room.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:39]** Okay, you step into the room As you step into the room, oh You hear a voice

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:47]** Coming from the computer room.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:47]** Says.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Where are you going?

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:58]** Dr. OK, you hear this coming from the computer room itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** Who said that, Dr. OK?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:04]** I've yet to surmise that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:08]** Do Colin and Hears hear that in the hallway?

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** Yeah, because the door's open.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:18]** Is it from like the speakers in the computer room or is it from one of the computers itself?

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** Sounds like it's just coming from the computer room itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Hearing that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:25]** Does Dr. Okay figure out where it's coming from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:29]** No, it sounds like it's coming from all over the whole room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** So there are speakers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:35]** You can't go all over the whole room.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:39]** Yeah, it just sounds like it's coming from the room.

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:44]** You think that with your 34, there's probably some concealed speaker somewhere.

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** Not sure where.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:55]** Are there other sensors within this room that I can perceive with my 34?

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:58]** Or should I roll again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:01]** I mean, nothing that you can see.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:03]** You have surmised as much as you can so far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:09]** Does the voice sound familiar?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:12]** A voice said, where are you going?

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** When Rick stepped out of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:19]** Does the voice sound familiar or does it sound... Why don't you ask?

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** I'm asking, do we recognize the voice?

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:23]** Does anybody recognize the voice?

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:25]** I don't think anybody would recognize the voice.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:29]** Rick wants to do a perception on the room real quick.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** The office.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** 16 for a total of 25.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Nothing.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** There's nothing in there.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:42]** And then he's going to say into the comms that the other two out in the hallway here, it is all clear.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Moving back into the computer room.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:45]** Ah.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:48]** Everyone's here.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Who are you?

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:57]** I am the listener.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:01]** You're doing a lot of talking for a listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:02]** Oh.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:03]** I've said

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** Maybe 10 words.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:10]** Keep shaming it, Rick.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** Do that.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:17]** It's been quite a long time since I've spoken in common.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:20]** Who are you?

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** How can I help you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** I am Rick 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:30]** Hello, Rick 19.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** Who is everyone else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:38]** Rick nudges Dr. O.K.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:41]** and gives him a look, like shrugs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** Hmm.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:48]** My name is Dr. Kantu Okatis.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:55]** What manner of construct are you, listener?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:00]** Nice to meet you, Dr. Okatis.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:05]** Please, the others may step in, if you'd like.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:13]** I am, well, I am many things now.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:17]** And I have been many things.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:26]** But I made sure that my programming would never allow me to know what I was before.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:28]** What can I help you with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** Well, what are you now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:34]** Well, I am able in my present form.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:41]** to be able to do my best to answer any questions that you have.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** That's my purpose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** Hmm, what's this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:51]** Ah, good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Colin adheres, you don't step in, right?

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** Colin has not stepped in yet, no.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** No, he is not going in, are you serious?

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** He's still undecided.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** Effect is in the room, though.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** Effect is in the room.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** She's not the one talking, right?

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** Just to be clear.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** Yeah.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:13]** Her mouth is wide open and she's the voice coming out of her mouth.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** Eyes rolled all the way back.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** Her head starts turning.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** She's just like levitating and spinning.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** Oh, man.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:19]** No.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** I am the listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:24]** I am the listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:32]** Terrapin is first and foremost this room.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:38]** Anybody else who says it is something else is wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:43]** It has been a staging point.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:46]** Terrapin has been a rendezvous point.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:54]** It has been a prison, a lab, an interrogation space, and much more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:55 - 00:35:01]** But first and foremost, it is this room, and it is me.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** It is the cradle of listening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:18]** Rick is going to step into the middle of the room, uh, kind of do like a cautious spin around, take just a look, like looking around and he's going to say it out loud.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:21]** Just like, can you, I, I'm just going to be blunt here.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:22]** Please.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:25]** Do you know that this space has been overrun by Reptoids?

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:27]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** And what is your affiliation with them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:37]** I was once a Reptoid.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** My programming allows me to know that.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:44]** Is there a question that I can answer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:49]** What is your purpose here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** To answer questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** Oh, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** And to listen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:59]** So you've been listening to everything on this planet, I assume.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** Colin, did you step in or not step in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:04]** I saw you a little, a little ready forward.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:07]** I was going to, but then, then Dr. Okay.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Kept going with his dialogue.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** So I kind of retconned it back out of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** All good.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Can you repeat your question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:19]** Uh, I presume you've been listening to everything on this planet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:25]** Well, on this planet is difficult.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:29]** I listen off planet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** Fascinating.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:38]** What can you tell us about the things you've heard?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:42]** There's a lot that I've heard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:50]** It might help if some of you want to think of more specific questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:59]** At this point, Colin steps in and moves left a few squares into the room and growls to the computer, where the f*** is my sister?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** And what is your name?

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** Colin.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** Colin Eden Brandt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:17]** Well, I can tell you a little more.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** Maybe give you an answer to that question.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:27]** But I need to know something from you as well.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:36]** Colin, tell me about a memory that's important to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:43]** You're not some know-it-all computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:52]** I know a lot of things, but in order to tell you what I know, I do need to know something about what you know.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:54]** A trade.

**[00:37:56 - 00:38:00]** It's not one for one, but... You know.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:03]** There are things that I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** And I would love to know something.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** Learn something new.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Um...

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** What knowledge do you seek, listener?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:28]** Tell me something personal.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** It's okay.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:30]** I can wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:32]** I will volunteer.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:36]** And what was your name?

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:39]** I have, I am Rick 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** Right.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** You left and came back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:42]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** Okay.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** What do you know what to share?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** Oh, oh, that's right.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:55]** I, I have vague memories of a, a wife and two children.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** Oh, I am.

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:04]** I, I am not certain if they are mine, but it feels as if they were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:10]** Rick, give me an intelligence check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:17]** Is that... I have a plus one.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:19]** Ooh, a 19.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** Ooh, a 19.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** Okay, okay, okay, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** Vague memories.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:31]** Is there one that sticks out?

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** Perhaps...

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:45]** Oh, it's been so long since I've had dinner or been on a walk.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:50]** Maybe one of those that you can share.

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:52]** Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:54 - 00:40:01]** I have an ability called Pious Scientist that allows me to use life science to identify creatures normally identified using mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** Oh, that's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:03]** Would that help?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:07]** If you want to try and use mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** Yeah.

**[00:40:11 - 00:40:12]** I got a 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** 29.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:23]** You are certain that this was somebody real in the physical world, and they are now somebody in the digital world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** So if I just blow up these computers, they're gone?

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** But they're probably elsewhere?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:32]** They might be.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** They also might not be.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:38]** Give me one sec while you're thinking about that.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** I need to open the door for my cat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** Meow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:45]** Meow.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:54]** Classic cat wants to go out scratching at the door.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:56]** You have to push her out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** Yeah, she got her claw.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** We knew it from her nails.

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:06]** She got her claw caught on the hat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:09]** Listener, can we rewind just a second?

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** You said you were a Reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** I was so close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:16]** Were you a part of the Reptoids that have taken over this space?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** Yes, at one time.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:24]** I can tell you more.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** I just need a trade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:33]** What is the nature of the memory you seek?

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** Something personal.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Fine.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:50]** Um, and Colin takes a deep breath and you see his shoulders start to relax as Will shakes his head at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** I'm with you, Will.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:57]** This seems like a bad idea.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** That memory's gonna be gone, bud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:03]** You guys remember that time that I killed my character at the end of the Nano Adventure?

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** That was fun.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:29]** yeah this is definitely not gonna happen again yeah uh colin you see his shoulders start to relax as he he thinks um i mean you you sort of see his face uh he gets lost in thought his eyes glaze over a little bit um and a a wry smile comes to his mouth um

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:47]** As a boy, I remember my father, he worked all hours but there was always one time a week he would spend time with me and my wee sister.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:51]** And it didn't matter what we were doing.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:59]** There was a dessert trolley at Absalom that would go around the decks and played a very distinct tune.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:02]** And each time we heard that tune, it didn't matter what we were doing.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** We would drop everything.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:07]** We would run out the door chasing each other.

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:15]** We'd all get some sort of sweet or sweet cream and enjoy the time and the treat together.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** That's so special.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:25]** How did that tune go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** Am I supposed to sing it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:33]** It's up to you.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:42]** Everybody listen to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:44]** I like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** Colin, give me an intelligence check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** I scroll up to my intelligence.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:59]** Okay.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** It's a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** 19.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:04]** That memory feels...

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:14]** but the more that you talk and discuss it, the more it becomes, as you said, your eyes glaze over, you start to remember it.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:19]** And then when you sing it, that really cements it for you.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:22]** It's like the memory of that melody was just out of reach.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:24]** And then your brain catches it.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:34]** And as you're singing it and the listener starts singing it as well,

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** I need you to give me a will save.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:42]** Will save.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:42]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:49]** Copyright 2020.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** Yeah, 2020.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** Two on the die for an 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** As you're singing it,

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:15]** And the listener starts to... That feeling that you couldn't quite remember the melody comes back.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:26]** And then it's like that moment when you just had it and you were remembering it, and then your mind changed to something else.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:30]** And then you're like, wait, what was I doing?

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:37]** As you have now lost that memory, you no longer have that memory.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** I didn't call it Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:57]** I called it the minute that you all calling you start to forget the listener goes and as soon as it ends,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:06]** the light in the room goes dark, and then suddenly all around you,

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:14]** It's replaced with this purple and blue-green grid that appears in the air floating all around you.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:19]** And on the floor is this slowly turning expanded hologram.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:30]** You see these nodes of light starting to float around you, somewhat loosely based in these hexagonal bases that seem to track each node.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** Thank you, Colin.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** I enjoyed that.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:40]** Welcome to the cradle of listening everyone.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:48]** Dr. K with your 34, I'm going to roll it over and say that you immediately see that there are sensors everywhere.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:52]** Everything else in the room is black and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:46:53 - 00:47:21]** the light from the door is shining in here's i don't know if you step in or if you want to stay out or not but come on in here let's go into this terrible trap that we just walked into can he you're aware dr okay that this is yeah go ahead yours i was gonna say can you hear what's going on like on the other side of this web he's gonna yeah this web is is just a projection


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** Always, always cautious.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:31]** The web is a projection and what comes up

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:55]** are these motes of light and each light is rotating and each light is moving in a rotation pattern slowly around the room and Dr. K with your 34 you're well aware now that that the room was built to be able to project this to share information visually

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:58]** And track sensors of where everything is.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:01]** Which is how it was able to track that Rick-19 is leaving and then coming back.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** And see what's going on.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Things are set up in the room.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** So that way things are mostly concealed.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:11]** But you can see that all the other screens in the room have gone black.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:18]** So it's just like in those movies when they pull up something and the whole sphere explodes all around them.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:20]** And you're able to walk through.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:23]** It's a danger room.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:25]** The listener says...

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:28]** You asked earlier what this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** What is the cradle?

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:38]** We are a communications observatory in a way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:47]** Anybody who wants can give me an engineering or, you know, physical science slash mysticism check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:51]** I rolled a computer earlier for 21.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:51]** 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:54]** Is computer valid for this?

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** I might have not heard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:59]** Dr. K rolled a 24 in engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:01]** 24 in engineering.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:02]** Sorry, 26.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:05]** 26 and 21 in engineering computers.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:07]** Did anybody roll physical science or mysticism?

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** That's a 34 mysticism.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** 34 mysticism.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:11]** Okay.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:11]** Yeah.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:14]** I don't know if I can participate because I'm not in there.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** Can I?

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:25]** You are seeing it from the outside, so there are a lot of bright lights that are spilling out into the hallway there, but it's not like you can't see what's going on.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:32]** I think if you want to give a look, you can, but I don't know that you can interact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** Okay.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:36]** Did physical science, nat 20, 29 in total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:40]** Okay.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:44]** You realize that these spinning modes, motes of light...

**[00:49:45 - 00:50:11]** up down all around you are two things it is both at times from your perspective it looks like a map of the packed worlds and sometimes it'll shift to beyond it seems like a star's constellation sometimes it seems like it's larger moats that are maybe planets that come together as it's rotating and moving and then you also realize that it's a file containment system

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:17]** You are visually walking through, looking at data being projected.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** Maybe geolocated?

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Maybe not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:31]** What was your question again, Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:35]** Where the f*** is my sister?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:38]** Eden brand.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:47]** The whole room shifts and moves and then stays still on one single moat.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:50]** And that moat starts to turn purple and spin.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:56]** And it moves up in front of you, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:56 - 00:51:00]** You can touch it if you want, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:05]** It's okay.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:07]** Colin touches it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:14]** It expands and for everyone else, it looks like it moves into this like wave of light.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:19]** But for you, Colin, it coalesces into, um, things that you can read.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:29]** You realize that it's in Reptoid at first and then moves into common as it's translated.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:35]** And the listener speaks.

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:47]** There seems to be a cluster of information on Akiton about a Korra Edenbrand.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:55]** Records of employment at the Ringworks on Akiton and on Roselight.

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:01]** Those are the most concrete data that I have for you.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:09]** There does appear to be some conversations, but again, I can't see fully into what's being said.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:18]** But there are conversations on Absalom Station recently that reference someone named Cora Edenbrand.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** And then the moat goes back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** Does anyone have another question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:30]** Why is her name on one of these cots?

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** Searching.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:33]** Floats again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:45]** I'm seeing there's a... That's part of the connection with her name appearing in Roselight.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:48]** But those files appeal to be encrypted.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** I can't access them.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:55]** Moves out.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** Does anyone else have a question?

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** Or Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** Maybe you have more.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:06]** How do we get off this godforsaken place?

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** That's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:12]** It moves again.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:15]** Several motes coalesce into a starship.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:23]** The Voidcrier is here at Terrapin Station and could be a valuable way for you to get off if you'd like.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:28]** Goes back into the floating motes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:33]** Where is Orvier Redbacher?

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:36]** Pike.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** Pike.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:38]** Pike.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:43]** Orvier Pike is currently in the hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** Oh, this is very useful.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:49]** This is the most useful quote NPC we've had.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** Kiers wants to ask something.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** I mean, I don't know if I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** Are you electric type?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:55 - 00:54:03]** If the individual at the threshold would like to cross the threshold, I can then speak with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:03]** Hi.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:06]** And then you blow up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** Oh, here's a little face.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:11]** The lasers just slice you.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:11]** The door.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** Resident Evil movie.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:17]** The door just slowly closes behind you.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:20]** The listener goes, that's better.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** Yeah, I'm sure it feels better.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** Shut up.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** Mr. I ran in immediately.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** You're all finding out cool stuff.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** I want to find out cool stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:30]** I sacrificed myself for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:33]** Okay, everyone else.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** All right.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** Sounds like a lyric on a Lifehouse song.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** Anyway, go ahead.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:42]** Here's asked, like, is Colin's girlfriend alive?

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:43]** What was her name again?

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:45]** You actually forgot.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:45]** I can't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:50]** I was trying to remember before asking you about Orvier.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:52]** Wow, she made an amazing impact on us.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:53]** She did.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** What was Colin's girlfriend's name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** I guess we'll ask that first.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:59]** What was Colin's girlfriend's name?

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** I don't know Colin's girlfriend.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:03]** No, I don't think that's it.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:06]** Laquan... Kaniko Breeze.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:07]** There it is.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** Kaniko Breeze.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:12]** Is Kaniko Breeze alive?

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:15]** Is Kaniko Breeze alive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:25]** I'm finding several mentions of Kaniko Breeze seemingly on... Oh.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** On Ghaskari?

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** Many, many mentions there.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** Including family.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:35]** Uh... A bar.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:36]** Human.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:38]** Okay.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:40]** Searching for further evidence.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:40]** Is she alive?

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:48]** There is transmission from a ship moving from the vast to Varos.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:51]** I don't see anything more past that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:53]** Currently.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** I'm sorry.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:54]** Here's.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:55]** Is that right?

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:55]** No.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** From before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:57]** When?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** This is maybe a few days.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:03]** Well, that's.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** You seem like you want to ask a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:12]** I was wondering what information you have about us from these Reptoids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:14]** Ah, good question.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:22]** So, Dr. Kontu Okatis, here's Colin Edenbrand, Rick19, and Effecta.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:31]** Effecta, I have many records of you in Roselite, and then also in your past.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** Would you like me to go over them with you?

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:36]** Effecta's

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:40]** I mean, if you want, uh, that's, that's fine.

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:43]** Uh, but it sounds like you're just reciting to me my own history.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** The listener's like, sure.

**[00:56:48 - 00:57:03]** And the listener starts to go into a somewhat overview detail about effecta, just saying that she has done training, uh, in criminology, studied biology and medicine at Cabaret university on Comina.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:10]** It seems like you moved around a lot as a child, and your parents were in the Knights of Galarian.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:15]** I'm seeing many, many records about you from quite all over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:29]** As for the other four of you, I am not seeing much data about you at all.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:41]** There appears to be some data that was sent from Tyrcalis and from the Voidcrier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** That's right.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:44]** There is data being sent to Roselight.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:50]** It looks like it is video and audio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** Let me see if I can get that for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:55 - 00:58:13]** the moats coalesce and you see these videos that look like they are cut videos of you attacking the peritons and attacking the stewards of what the void cryer

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:21]** It's the video from the camera of you all playing a game, but also discussing what to do when you're at Tyrcalis.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:26]** It's the video of you moving around and stealing bikes.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:28]** It looks like it's camera from body armor.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:39]** At Tyrcalis, there are just audio only of what appears to be the...

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:49]** Language of you speaking to Dr. Nodens when Dr. Nodens was first asking you questions and then second asking you questions.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:54]** But you notice that a lot of this is cut and doctored very well.

**[00:58:56 - 00:59:04]** Especially some of the questions and your responses are trimmed, taken out of context, made to appear that you are aggressive, unstable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:07]** To the stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:08]** Correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:12]** Yeah, this is, they're using propaganda.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:15]** That's the information that I have about you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** Hmm.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:19]** Who, who authored this information?

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** Oh, that's anonymous.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:31]** It does seem to come from the void crier and tear callous over the past 48 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:38]** Are there any other questions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:44]** Why would they want myself and Dr. Okay alive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:48]** Oh, I don't know that, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** That's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** Well, this has been fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:54]** I want to do two things.

**[00:59:55 - 01:00:00]** Rick, you mentioned before that there were memories that you were about to share with me.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:08]** And the smile in that share with me is like, so unsettling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:08]** Yeah.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:14]** That you were about to share with me about your family as a courtesy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:24]** I've looked up to see if there's anything about a wife and children for Rick and 18, and I didn't find anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** I'm sorry.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** Is there another question that I can answer for you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:39]** And I want to encourage you guys to start to, like... If you want to ask me a question, too, just as a player, it's fine.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:44]** Obviously, like, we're having a good time role-playing this, but, like, there's...

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:47]** There might be a lot here that you can find out.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:51]** So even if you just want to jump over it and say, I want to know about this topic or this thing.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:58]** Or if you want to say in general, we're going to ask a couple of questions, then I can answer a few other things.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:01]** But I really want to give you guys a chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:02]** Here's.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:19]** I'm concerned that if I, if he was asked certain things that, that they might be able to relay those questions onto someone else that would interact with it, is that a concern or would they kind of like silo this experience and, and it wouldn't be accessed by, by others at a later point?

**[01:01:20 - 01:01:23]** Cause it might be a sensitive question, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:23]** Yeah.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:25]** You think that, um,

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:39]** One, the fact that as Dr. O'Kay surmised, the listener is sequestered to this room and believes this room to be the beating heart of Terrapin and the reason why Terrapin exists as a communications observatory.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:45]** And so you think, well, everything's probably literally airlocked to this room.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:53]** Uh, and while they have communications out, their point is to listen and maybe they don't send things out.

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:59]** And you think based on the memory that Colin had to give that unlocked the

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:21]** this this new setup in the room you you think probably the data that is here usually stays here unless someone with enough credentials or willing to give up a memory would there be like access logs that she would that they would report potentially do you want to ask if they have access yeah

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:25]** I mean, that's something that you would have to go through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:27]** Do you mind if we look around your computer?

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** Oh, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:31]** Yeah, that's not a problem.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:33]** I'll ask them straight up as well while that's happening.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:41]** Listener, if I were to ask you a question, would you keep my question a secret?

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:47]** Or if someone else came into this room and asked what we asked, would you feel bound to tell them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:53]** Ah, no, I would not feel bound to tell them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:53 - 01:03:01]** My stores are pretty vast and my ability to look is looking, observe what is out there is quite large.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:07]** So unless they ask about this specific thing, I typically would not share that.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:12]** Would you like me to put a layer of access on it in order to keep it discreet and secret?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:13]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:14]** Okay.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:14]** Keep it secret.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** Sounds good.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:15]** Keep it safe.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:17]** Do you want to keep it secret from the others in this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:22]** Can I communicate with you telepathically, perhaps?

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:23]** And yes.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** Telepathically?

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:25]** Yeah.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** Oh, sure.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:27]** Of course.

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** Okay.

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:32]** So I'd like to... And then now this f***ing thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:34]** The listener is in the head.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:35]** Yeah.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:40]** Here's... Do you want to... Kelly, do you want to share this in front of Will, Colin, and Will, Kevin, and Vinny?

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** They can hear it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:42]** Yeah, they can hear it.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:45]** I just... Here is... He's not a very trusting person, that's all.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** In spite of... Sure.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:46]** Okay.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:51]** So, but like, do you want... You're trying to keep it from the rest of us as players?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** Just the characters.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** You guys are fine.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:54]** I don't mind.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:59]** So you hear in your head, the listener says, hi, I'm here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:03:59 - 01:03:59]** Hey.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** What can I answer for you?

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** That's very intimate.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:02]** You don't call it.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:03]** You can't call it.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:06]** Anyway, it's not necessary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:08]** Then he took off his headphones anyway.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:08]** You know what?

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** He's just opting out.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:12]** Go ahead.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:20]** Could you tell me everything you know about Shira Dawnbreaker?


## Speaker_0

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:44]** form of yeah of the ship and he inserts the ship name that for some reason i can't remember right now here's the ship no not the no not the caduceus uh oh uh yeah yeah the nays revenge the nays revenge ah sure don't break her especially regarding her current whereabouts and current whereabouts search one second


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:52]** Everything does seem to move and it comes up to you.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:53]** But again, it's like holding a clipboard.

**[01:04:54 - 01:05:02]** The back of what they're seeing is, uh, um, you know, kind of opaque and you can't, they can't see what's, what's coming up in front of your face years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:06]** Don't worry what I'm showing you.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:08]** They can't see only you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:15]** there's very limited information that I'm able to find about, about sheer Dawnbreaker.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:23]** There does appear to be several warrants out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:34]** There also, most recently, appears to be a ping between Roselight and Absalom Station.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:35]** Uh,

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:46]** There's someone at Fairwinds, with a Fairwinds email address, who is asking.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:51]** That's the best that I have about Shira Dawnbreaker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:56]** You would remember that Fairwinds is one of the major corporations of Rose Light.

**[01:05:56 - 01:06:04]** They are one of the first big gas biotech companies in the space, and they almost own the industry there.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:07]** They are very prominent in that field.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:11]** So the Fairwinds, well-known name across the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:37]** pack wins it's like saying oh yeah no there's like somebody at you know like genentech or things like that like like okay cool yeah thank you for that um yeah of course i just have one more question um please my friend i believe is dead i wanted to see if his body was picked up and if he was given his last rights um his name is a formerly of the same ship


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:41]** Also the name's revenge.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:42]** Yes.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:49]** Let me look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:53]** I'm not seeing any death certificate.

**[01:06:55 - 01:07:00]** Nor am I seeing any sort of... Acknowledgement of medical records.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:04]** I am, however, seeing...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:19]** His name mentioned at an art gallery on Roselight called Gallery Ethereal at the Old Hark Palace.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:24]** It seems like there was something sent to that art gallery.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:26]** There's no receiver.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:31]** Wait, wait, what was the name of the gallery again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:34]** Gallery Ethereal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:35]** And at the palace name was...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:38]** The old Harkonnen Palace.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:39]** Sorry, the old Hark Palace.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:41]** Hark Palace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:43]** Hark Palace.

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:47]** Is it the Palace Obscura?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:47]** I'm just kidding.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:49]** You mentioned an art gallery, naturally.

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:51]** All right, yeah.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:52]** That sounds like it.

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:53]** Was there another question?

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:57]** What's the last activity or record you have of him?

**[01:07:57 - 01:07:59]** Is it that or is it something else?

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:00]** A movement or something of some kind?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:04]** The last record that I have of him is from long ago.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:06]** It appears to be related to the Knave's Revenge.

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:12]** It's seemingly moving from the Knave's Revenge onto another ship.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:23]** And then the last records I see are of checking in at a hotel in what appears to be some city on Akiton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:52]** okay got it thank you that's all the question I had appreciate it wait there's something else here there's something else here with you and here's I'm ready you look down and the listener says


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:54]** Ah.

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:55]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:59]** Oh, that is, that is curious.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:02]** I don't know why I didn't notice it before.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:14]** And here's you look down and the puck is glowing in your pocket.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:15]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:16]** Colin, you can be here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:18]** Hey, Vinny, you're back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:20]** Oh, it sounds like the episode's over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:23]** Yeah, and it's over literally as Kelly freezes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:27]** Well, Colin would have known that, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:28]** Yeah, I think so.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:44]** So you didn't hear any of the things that the listener was asking, but you did notice at the end of the episode, or at the end of the episode, you did notice that at one point, the Puck and Colin Puckett began to blow blue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:46]** I'm curious this is.
