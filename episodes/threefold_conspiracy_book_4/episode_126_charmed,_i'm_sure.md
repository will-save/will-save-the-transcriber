**[00:01:41 - 00:02:10]** i'm just going to put a bunch of explosions like die hard like super intense i don't have a explosion drop that's sad i think that should be a goal for our 2025 just for you to get an explosion drop that is that's our new year's resolution is get an explosion drop yeah i mean that's like kids laughing and people that's low-hanging fruit that's basically also dealing i got i got some explosions for you we have not done a starfighter story time in a while i was thinking about that like we should start for a story time like the lobster or something

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:13]** How did you know, Kev?

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:17]** I have that on my agenda for today, and you literally called it.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:17]** Wow.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:25]** If we had something like inspirations or something that allowed you to re-roll, that's been something that's on my mind.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** Let's talk about that in the business meeting next week.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:29]** Wait, really?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:29]** Till then.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** Okay.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** That's been on my mind.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** I don't know.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** We'll see.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:38]** If you have any ideas out there, dear listener willing, please let us know.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:45]** Question for you all, we were talking about a lot of different stuff in the pre-roll list.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** One question.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** What popped into your mind?

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:51]** What popped into my mind actually was not that.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:56]** It was, is anybody watching any good TV or movie lately?

**[00:02:56 - 00:03:00]** I feel like we haven't done a check-in on what we're all reading or stuff.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:06]** So I was like, hey, what are you watching, movie, TV, consuming that you're really enjoying right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:24]** or maybe not really enjoying maybe you're like y'all don't listen to this it's not worth your time yeah so uh i guess i'll go one positive one negative and we'll start with a negative because why not um started the new season of squid games and watched the first 15 minutes passed out fell asleep

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:46]** uh picked it back up and the rest of the first episode was so lackluster like slow no real direction not not really loving where it's going so i'm not sold on on squid games 2 just yet um and uh and the positive alissa had not seen star wars so we just finished the original trilogy

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:50]** going to go back and watch the prequel trilogy in the next few days.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:54]** So, you know, always good to watch Star Wars, right?

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:54]** Always.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:54 - 00:04:00]** And then all of Clone Wars and Rebels and Ahsoka and the whole gambit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:03]** Make her watch absolutely everything.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:06]** It's always like a rite of passage to show your girlfriend every single bit of Star Wars.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:09]** Has she watched The Blind Door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:35]** no i was just gonna say that well so good no star wars properties season two coming out soon uh uh skeleton uh crew is actually one of my top shows recently uh i love it i i absolutely love it it's definitely like it's a goonies pirates of the caribbean all this stuff with a star wars like overview and i just it's a very fun friendly show um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:55]** squid games i haven't gotten into yet it's like a very old-school spielberg kind of um like take it feels like yeah it it feels that way it feels like and therefore old lucas too you know so like um yeah yeah that luke squid game i actually i don't oh i'm sorry go ahead


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** I don't want to say Squid Game is on my short list.

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:00]** And the other thing I was going to say is the What If series.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:04]** I think they hit that out of the park every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** That's on my list to check out.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** It's very good.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:10]** I actually I don't like Squid Game at all.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:16]** I've seen the original, but I think that in the West,

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** I'm just going to be that guy or whatever.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:21]** But like, that's kind of the first time that concept has really been shown.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:26]** But like in terms of like, there's been all kinds of Asian shows and movies that have had that take before.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:29]** So by the time I saw it, I was like, this is really f***ing lame.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:32]** It's actually the least well executed of that theme I've ever seen.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:33]** I hated it.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** The original as well.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** I wouldn't even bother watching the second one.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** But like,

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:48]** But the actor who shows up for just a moment in there, who like does the little game with him, the beanbag game, that guy's a dope actor and he's in a lot of really good like Korean shows and stuff.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:52]** And anyway, yeah, but I totally agree with the Star Wars stuff.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:55]** It's always cool to watch the new trilogy, old trilogy.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:55]** Not new.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:02]** The lead actor from Squid Games was one of the Jedi in... Yes.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:04]** That guy's a great actor, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:05]** Yeah.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:08]** He was like, I really want to be in Star Wars.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:15]** So he learned English so he could work on his lines in like three or four months.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:15]** In like six weeks.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:16]** Yeah.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:20]** Some really short time was like, yo, I want to do Star Wars.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:20]** Let me do Star Wars.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:21]** And then he killed it.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** That's great.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:47]** i we have some respect to that guy we are going to be watching uh lord of the rings because aria was like hey i would love to see that and i was like well let me okay okay let's boot up you're ready let's go you gotta get the extended see should i yeah watch yes do it because she okay like just just way better okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:47 - 00:07:15]** i think so yeah you honestly you should you you should make her suffer through every single moment of like anya over the top and yeah and then like uh and then okay lord of the rings is great but the one main criticism that i hear from it and um especially from girlfriends that i've shown it to is like it just seems like all they do is is run everywhere the entire movie that's like the one thing that i take and that is kind of true the eagles to mordor yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** The one time they're not walking.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** It's when they call an Uber to get home.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** You know, come on now.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** That's like 60%.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** However, it's still good.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** And then some of them do get it.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:28]** And I'm like, you got it.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:29]** You know it's good.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** Yeah, it's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:35]** I mentioned it before the ep, but I have been really...

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:39]** Again, I don't want to give anything away, but Dune Prophecy, I enjoyed it.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** That's all I'll say about it.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** Definitely enjoyed it.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:44]** I think it's worth starting and watching.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** And then you let me know what you think because none of you have seen it.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** So it's a cool premise.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** I enjoyed it.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** Check it out.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** Also, what we do in the shadows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** Yeah, I finished that recently.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:55]** Same.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:58]** I'm sad to see it go, though.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** It never gets old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:03]** The bits never go to the final season that just came out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:07]** It's literally the exact ending that that show needed.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** Great.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** Yep.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:13]** Treated it with the same tone and perspective the whole series.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:16]** The show that I am looking forward to watching that I haven't started yet.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:19]** I think it's out.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:22]** Severance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:25]** Severance 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** Season 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** Phenomenal.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** I dare say... I think it's coming out now.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** It's coming out the 17th.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:35]** January.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:37]** I haven't seen it.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** Benny, you should watch it.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:42]** I would say stop recording, but we need to get this episode out.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:44]** So I would say... Turn this off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:48]** If you're listening, maybe go watch this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:50]** If you're listening and not driving.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** Yeah, or cutting steak.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:56]** Or doing anything that's important where you need to watch your handout coordination and everything.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** Yeah, that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:04]** If you're manning a nuclear launch key, you should not be watching.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:06]** Just pause what you're doing, go watch Severance, and then come back.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** The key will still be there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** Right.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:10]** Yeah, it will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:14]** So, quick content question, because this came up.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:20]** I'm curious, show of hands, who's seen The Last of Us, the Prime show?

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** Okay, three hands.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:22]** Awesome.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:24]** Show of hands, who's played the game?

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** Yeah.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:25]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:25]** Awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** Yeah, not all the way, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** Two hands.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:29]** Okay.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** If you had to pick one, like, are they comparable?

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** Would you do one?

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** Would you do the other?

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:35]** Would you recommend either or both?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** The Venn diagram is a circle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:45]** Depending on how you play in games, but like playing The Last of Us, it just feels so visceral.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:59]** It's one of the first games that I felt like my heart would beat as I walked into a room because it's such cinematic, immersive gameplay, especially at that time.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:04]** The movie or the show did a great job of making a show out of it.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:12]** And it gives the same feel, but playing the game puts you in that role where the show, you're just an observer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:41]** okay cool thanks for that yeah the game's better for sure but the show's decent it's pretty good it's a very faithful adaptation usually adaptations suck yeah this one is not bad that's that's where i expected this conversation to go i'm glad it was faithful um i got one of those like handheld gaming pcs for christmas and so i'm like okay do i get the last of us do i not get the last of us is it worth it do i just watch the show play it sounds like it's worth it oh the game yeah the game's so good


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:49]** John got me hooked on Inscription, and I played that three hours a night for a week and a half, two weeks straight.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:51]** Yeah.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:51]** It's fun.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** I'm not going to spoil anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:54]** I am deep into Dave the Diver.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:57]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:59]** Have you opened your own?

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:03]** You started franchising to other Blue Lugans now?

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** Because how deep does the game go?

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:08]** Last time we checked, you had a farm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:14]** Yeah, I have a farm and a branch on the other, like, further shore.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** Nice.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:19]** And I have a fish farm, like at, like, pools.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:19]** That's right.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** And I'm doing...

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** underwater dredging.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:33]** When it's foggy, there's like a necromancer type fish stuff going on.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** And you can also like dredge for treasure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:38]** Wait, this one fish comes along and raises on a dead fish?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:43]** And there's like ghouls that come into your sushi restaurant.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:46]** And yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:46]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** That's all they eat.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:50]** They only eat the like ghost fish.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** This is awesome.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:53]** Like the zombie fish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:55]** Diet of strictly ectoplasm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:55]** Yeah.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:56]** This is awesome.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:57]** And Godzilla showed up.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** So that's cool.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** There's a Godzilla.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** No, I helped him.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:10]** I helped Godzilla fight another... Kaiju?

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:10]** Yeah.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Kaiju.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** Nice.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:18]** Wow, this game... And then I served Marlin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:21]** And then I served Marlin.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** You know what?

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** This is so Dave the Diver.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:28]** You just help Godzilla and then you're like, hey, we got some fresh Marlin in the back.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** You want to try it?

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** It's all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:33]** We'll play that game, Dave the Diver.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** Dave the Diver?

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** How's it going over there, Kelly?

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** It looks good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Cool.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:43]** Pretty sure my first time playing that game was at your bachelor party, John.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:46]** It was just like, nobody else is doing anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:48]** Will, I thought that you tried it at Gen Con.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** I tried it at Gen Con, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** Maybe it was at Gen Con.

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** It was at Gen Con, yeah.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:55]** Bringing the Switch is never a bad idea.

**[00:12:56 - 00:13:01]** Hey, I want to give a couple shout-outs to some awesome people.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:12]** Recently, in December, we acknowledged that we had three individuals who had been subbed to our coffee for one year.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:18]** And so, just wanted to shout-out those people here on the pod for Adam and Finder and Taco Mark.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:21]** We love y'all and appreciate y'all so much.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** Thank you so much.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:26]** Also, shout out to the new subscriber that we had, Connie.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** Connie.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** Come say hi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:52]** Ask us weird and intrusive questions that aren't bank details.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:53]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** That aren't bank details.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:58]** Or tell Benny to do something unreasonable.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:00]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:02]** We're sending out something for the anniversary folks.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:05]** So what could they choose from again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** We sent it out.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:15]** They can choose from a t-shirt, supported t-shirt, or from a sweet rocks glass with the, we'll say, logo on it.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** It's for whatever you want.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:26]** I wouldn't do hot beverages, but you know, it could be like any iced beverage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** Or non-iced, just not hot, you know?

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:31]** For those people who just like a lukewarm beverage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** Flat, warm Coke.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** You could put hot in it.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:39]** I just wouldn't put hot and then put cold instantly because then that would make it crack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:42]** I think it would be hard to hold rock glass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:44]** It's not as hard as rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Or do, and then buy another one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:51]** And then, yeah, or just, yeah, and then just let us know and send us the sweet image.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:53]** Actually, I kind of... I just had a merch idea.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:59]** It'd be kind of cool to just have a solid shirt and then just in the pocket, it's just... It's the We'll Save logo, but it's the glass.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:03]** So it's just like the cartoon of just the glass with the logo.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** Just a pocket full of broken glass?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:07]** Yeah.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** Hey, man, you want to buy this shirt with a pocket full of broken glass?

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:20]** With that said, I did give Kevin a fake inspiration, fake future inspiration for a little bit of a Starfinder story time about...

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:25]** Lava Striders, because I realized I didn't give y'all nearly enough information about Lava Striders last time.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:27]** I just think they're super cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:30]** So I was just going to do a little... We just wanted to find out if we could ride them.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:33]** If you do this, you have to do their real mating sound.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** So I want to know what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:37]** I don't want it to be the Rhino one.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** I don't know.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:39]** I think you nailed it, Kelly.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** I think you nailed it.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:43]** No, it's not unappealing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:43]** You did.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:44]** It worked.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:45]** It worked, bro.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:46]** It was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:47]** The children are gone now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** You can do it.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** The children are gone now.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:50]** You can do it.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:55]** Look, there's actually not too much I don't want to say about Lava Striders.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:59]** I think one of the biggest things about them is that they thrive in this extreme heat.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:02]** So if you recall in Starfinder...

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:07]** Lore slash rules, extreme heat is 140 degrees Fahrenheit or above.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:12]** So they actually, like part of their physiology thrives in that.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** So if they are under it, they will start to suffer.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:26]** So it's one of those animals that, you know, if there was a zoo that had lava striders, they'd have to design a super heated space that, you know, people could maintain and comfortably go in to feed them.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:28]** They are huge animals though.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:30]** So they're 15 feet tall.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:33]** I would say probably at least 10 to 12 feet tall.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:36]** They have that kind of hammerhead look.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:45]** And one of the things that we talked about, you know, you had seen them in the lava stomping their herd animals, protecting their young.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** They trample.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:51]** They will run at the first sight of any possible danger.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:54]** They always try and flee their omnivores.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:59]** They have a very specific noise when they are in heat and are mating.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** What was that noise again, Kelly?

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** It's like, ooh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** Ooh, yeah.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** That's what they sound like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** You can strike my lava.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** Yeah.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:10]** Ooh, yeah.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** Cool, great.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** It's just that one phrase.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Yeah, that one.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** Ooh, yeah.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** Cool, solid.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** Yeah.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** Lava.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:17]** Yeah.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** Lava.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:22]** Wait, what did you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** Oh, I love it.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:28]** All right, I am revoking your fake future inspiration cap for that.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:30]** That's not good.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:37]** They can ignore difficult terrain with rock or lava.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** So they are well-versed.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** They grow up in it.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:40]** They know it.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:44]** They can run for eight hours a day.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:44]** They're like horses.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** They just can go.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Really hard.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** Yeah, they're really intense.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:50]** They have a lot of reach.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** They take up 15 feet of space.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** They have a reach of 15 feet.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:58]** They are vulnerable to cold, but they are literally immune to fire.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** And they have low light vision.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:03]** They are typically found on planets.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:03]** I'll end with this.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:08]** They're typically found on planets that have this extreme heat because that's where they thrive.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:15]** But one of the areas that they're most well-known here is in Veros.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:28]** attempts to try and find them on other planets with similar environments or biomes, um, you know, is an ongoing quest by some of the, uh, Xeno biologists, Benny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:33]** Um, just wanted to take a quick moment in our last episode.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:40]** I had talked about a new spell that I grabbed as part of my level up, um, looking closer at my character sheet, I'd already grabbed that spell.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** So, um,

**[00:18:43 - 00:19:11]** got rid of it and chose another one one that may serve us in our quest to discover who is and who isn't what they appear to be do you want to share with the audience share with the class all that I will say reveal reptoid about that spell okay can I go look in here sure I mean you're the GM you can go look wherever you want yeah yeah that's fine cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** Thank you for that update.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:17]** Any other updates before we dive in?

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:20]** Sweet.

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:20]** Nah.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:24]** Nah.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:24]** Nah.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:31]** Keep in mind, if we go back to the last step, you all are on your own.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:36]** I italicize that in my recap notes because I really wanted to chew that phrase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:37]** You're on your own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** And this is kind of your first time on your own.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:47]** I mean, after book two, you, you were, I don't like this music.

**[00:19:48 - 00:20:01]** Uh, after book two, you were in a way, but you still had to get out of what you knew or what you later found out to be out post Omicron.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:09]** So your PC decisions are entirely your own, where you want your compass to lead you, where you feel is important.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:17]** And for the time being, there's no immediate threat.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:20]** There's no immediate danger in your environment.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:23]** Maybe the last time you felt that way was.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:28]** Maybe when you first were on the Void Choir before you were abducted by Greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:31]** I mean, the elements, though, are kind of like... That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:32]** That's true.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:33]** Just saying.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** That's true.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:37]** The actual environment is very lethal, so let's be clear.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:45]** But in terms of the metaphysical threats around you, for a moment, there's a bit of respect.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:51]** You convinced last episode a herd of Lava Striders that nearby there was a Lava Strider in heat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:52 - 00:21:07]** check don't know if you had that on your bingo card but you did they're like acclimated to like extreme temperatures and there was one in heat there was one in heat you know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:15]** It's like 180 over there.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:15]** 180.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:17]** Hey, bro, it's 180 right here.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** You want to check it out?

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:24]** You successfully, air quotes, made it across a lava river, which is also pretty bad.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** And I do want to commend you.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:31]** You did make it across, A. And B, even though you did suffer a lot of damage, those were tough piloting checks.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:37]** You all did a great job both trying to pilot, trying to aid, and also...

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:55]** maneuvering through the islands of lava to help reduce some of the dc it was not easy you've been traveling across the bitter veros terrain towards tarabin station where all of your answers await i don't know

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:02]** But I appreciated that you all were not sure about what to do about was Terrapin Station worth it?

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** Who would we encounter there?

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:08]** Those are real questions that I would encourage the listener.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:11]** You've probably heard that if you're this deep into episode 126.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:18]** But if you haven't, I really liked your discussion that y'all are having both in character and out of character about why is it worth it?

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:23]** This is like what I perceive a lot of the...

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:47]** intent of the threefold conspiracy is about it's about choice about trying to justify why you're doing what you're doing what you feel you should be doing what are you meant to be doing you then decided and said hey we're going on our way what's that weird object that looks very normal to us it's a dome a black dome but it's foreign in this natural landscape

**[00:22:48 - 00:23:06]** You recall that you saw in some documents and or comms that there was some sort of black dome siphoning comms or at least connecting to, hijacking, pulling from the Tirkhalis to Terrapin pipeline that you know, again, is the only way that you can get comms off the base.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:11]** You had decided, well, we need to go to Terrapin to at least see, can we get any comms out?

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:18]** Should we see who is still on the Voidcrier, which we are now tracking to go towards Terrapin?

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:26]** And I'll note too that as you pulled up to this dome, I think here's, you were tracking originally the Void Crier's location.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:31]** That seemed to have stopped.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:37]** It seemed to have pinged in a location that you feel is roughly Terrapin, and then you lost connection.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:49]** The one last thing that I'll say before we get into what actually happened or where you are now is that maybe in the back of your minds, maybe you've forgotten about it because you're like, we have a goal now.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** We need to get there.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:54]** T'Kala's base blew up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:55]** It's gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:56]** It's gone.

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:03]** It was actually what scared the lava striders away so you could cross safely without starting the tram.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** I thought that the sex noise helped though.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** It did.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** It did help.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:08]** It did.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:09]** It did.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:09]** All right, cool.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:13]** I don't want all of that embarrassment to be for nothing.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** No, it was not for nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** Sex noise always helps.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:18]** It always does.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:18]** Yep.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** Oh, baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:21]** Well, well known.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:21]** Well known.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:24]** Whoever came up with it.

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** That was Kev.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:28]** We ended Last Dab with you all pulling up.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** It was quiet.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** Without sleeping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:32]** Without sleeping.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** With many people with low health.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** That's true.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:34]** Thank you.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** Yes, you don't.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:43]** You walked up to the dome and Rick19, I think you tried the door and it was locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** Yeah.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:50]** Kevin said last session he was like metagaming, but I'm sure that no one's going to be in there.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:52]** Was there anyone in there, Kevin, when you opened the door?

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** He didn't open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:56]** I will not confirm or deny.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:57]** All right, all right.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** He's making shit.

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:59]** Yeah, the door's locked.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** The door.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** So Rick, Rick, Rick.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** Yeah, what do you do?

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** Doesn't perceive anything.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:06]** He doesn't sense anything inside.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:09]** He doesn't, because I rolled a low perception.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:15]** And so Rick reaches down and he pushes the button to try to open it and nothing happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:22]** Dr. K and Hears, give me a computers or engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:26]** I got a 15 on computers.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:26]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:28]** Okay.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** But a moment, please.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** I got a 28.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:31]** 28.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:43]** As Rick and Colin are pretty much standing within 5, 10 feet right at the door, Dr. K, Bernice, and Hears are hanging back down the little pathway.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:47]** You're looking off to the side.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:49]** And again, you saw this.

**[00:25:50 - 00:26:16]** assemblage of trash technological trash debris that looks like comms and it telecommunications equipment with your computers and engineering check you recognize a couple things you think this was disassembled kind of in a hurry but some things still appear to be

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:21]** either still together or functioning or reassembled.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:29]** Like, it doesn't make sense that you're like, well, this, this element, this component is disassembled, but this other part is reassembled.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:34]** That's a little just odd.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** You push the door, Rick19.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** You push the button on the door.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** It doesn't open.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** The door is locked.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** Should we breach it?

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** Or do you guys want to hack into it?

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** Or we can find another way around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:51]** Have we tried knocking on the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** I have not.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** I don't know if we should or not.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:59]** Is that... He's got his head kind of up and reaching towards it.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:00]** Like, should I?

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:04]** I can't imagine these beggars are any worse than what we left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** What do you do?

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** I say knock on the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:16]** I just want to be cautious that we do not know if they are reptoids or if they are... If Rick knocks on the door... Some kind of steward happens.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:20]** Dr. Okay is going to cast detect thoughts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** Okay.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:26]** So Dr. Okay cast detect thoughts.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:30]** Rick, do you knock on the door?

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:34]** Does detect thoughts work through?

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** Cast it either way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:37]** You can cast either way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:38]** That's true.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:46]** Well, if it's got a range that can go through walls, then see if there's anyone behind the door.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** Okay.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:49]** I like this.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:53]** I like this, but then 60 feet is the range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** That's plenty.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:58]** We know from like 19 and what's the, what's the save.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** I see a will in the gates on it.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:00]** What's the save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** Uh, I think it's DC 13.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:04]** That's what it says on here.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:05]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:06]** We'll save.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** On my Hero Lab.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:09]** Shout out, Hero Lab.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** Shout out, Hero Lab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:13]** Appreciate you, Hero Lab and Lone Wolf.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** You are fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:16]** And I think Dr. O.K.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:22]** is going to move if we're in still free movement.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:25]** He's going to move a little closer to just encompass the whole.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** Sure.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** The whole Delm.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:28]** Yeah.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** Why can't I move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:30]** Kev, did you knock?

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** Yes or no?

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** I did not knock.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:40]** I was going to wait until everybody else did whatever they're going to do, which would include Dr. O'Kay's detectives.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:42]** Dr. O'Kay, you can't detect anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:51]** I don't get any sense of anything back there, but I will say that DC is very low.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:59]** For anyone who's an advanced creature.

**[00:28:59 - 00:28:59]** Okay.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** I see.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:02]** But the coast might be clear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:05]** Rick is going to knock.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:06]** Okay.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:10]** But as he does it, he looks back and he says, just be cautious.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** And he knocks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** How do you knock?

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** Do you do the standard?

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** Is there a doorbell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Shave and a haircut?

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** Yeah.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** You knock.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:23]** How do you knock?

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:24]** Yeah, tell us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** Is it shave and haircut?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:28]** This is good podcasting.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** Okay.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** It's shave and haircut.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** Okay.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:32]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:34]** It's universal, right?

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:37]** Well, there's also like the... You know.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** The three intents.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** The police open up.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** Police, let us in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:47]** Rick19, give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:51]** I gave you one last time and it was a one.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:55]** It's been definitely longer than six seconds.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:56]** Twelve seconds.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** A week?

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:57]** It's fine.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** It's been a whole week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:02]** That was a bad roll.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** That is 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** 11.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:09]** Can we ready an action if this thing opens?

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Sure, if you want to ready something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Rick's ready to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:14]** You can just have your weapon out.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** Do you want to have your weapon out?

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:16]** Okay.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** Yeah.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:19]** Okay.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** That's fine.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:23]** Kev, you hear a little bit.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** With an 11?

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:24]** You hear.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:28]** I knock.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:35]** And then maybe as you're about to, you hear a little whisper between two voices or so.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** And then you hear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:41]** Who is knocking at our door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:47]** And Dobby from Harry Potter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:50]** The creature is watching.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:52]** I said, who is knocking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** Master has come for toppy.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:58]** Who is knocking at our door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:01]** We are refugees looking for shelter.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:04]** Spent 10 years reading one book of Harry Potter.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** We got lost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:09]** We took a wrong turn.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:10]** Who is saying what?

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:13]** Because Kelly was talking, then Kevin was talking, then Will was talking.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:16]** So who is actually responding?


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:16]** Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:17]** All of you?

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:21]** Rick says that we are refugees, and then Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:23]** was continuing.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:25]** Kelly was going on and on about Harry Potter.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:29]** I was talking about how Kevin read one book over the last decade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:32]** Do you guys have a bathroom in there that we could just use?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:34]** I've read the entire series of Harry Potter.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Did that take you your entire life, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:39]** It took me seven years, but I did it.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:39]** All right.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** A book a year, then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** Got you.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Is there a lavatory in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:46]** Is that really what you need?

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:48]** You need a bathroom.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:52]** What do you actually need?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** Why are you here?

**[00:31:54 - 00:32:01]** Our vehicles are in disrepair and we have a long trip ahead of us over this volatile terrain.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** We could use assistance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:10]** We're trying to get away from whatever the sham of us to its base was over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** I don't know if you want to tell him that, but okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** So are you stewards?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** Yeah, I was trying to avoid that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** No, we don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** We were the cacked stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:21]** Rick is named.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:21]** Nope.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:24]** Here's this just leaning on the car watching this happen.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** Smoking a ciggy.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** He's laughing a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** We are not stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:28]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:29]** He didn't even have to strike it.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:32]** It just started burning when he pulled it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:37]** Take ten steps backwards.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:43]** We will talk, but take 10 steps backwards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** How many feet is 10 steps?

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** Rick steps back 10 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:49]** That's 10 feet, you ignoramus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:53]** Each step is one foot.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** I've got long legs.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:57]** My 10 steps is probably 15 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:00]** Just Dr. O'Keefe doing like a pee-pee dance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** Guys, I really gotta go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Yeah, I really gotta go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:07]** Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go right now.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** Look at the fluids here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:15]** Says the creature that's like mostly... Rick19.

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:17]** He's like 98% fluid.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:25]** As you're backing up, you do hear a little bit of like... I don't think this is... This is not a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:25]** I don't like this.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** And then there's a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:45]** the door unlocks boom rush and the door i don't know rick steps forward the door is that what you did no okay no the door opens the tiniest amount


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:59]** and Colin, maybe Dr. Okay and Rick, you can see one eyeball and the color blue, like a bright light blue in the area.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:05]** And then the door slowly opens.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:12]** And then they quickly, two figures come out and shut the door.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** So you can't see inside.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:20]** And they, these two individuals look tired, very worn down.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:25]** Their light blue suits are torn, smudged.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:27]** There's like burn marks in them.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:34]** You can tell underneath the suit that there's this probably Aztecs armor, cheap.

**[00:34:35 - 00:35:04]** something to protect you it's covered with dirt and ash this human female bald petite features and another human male about the same size very similar looking face with sharp angry features that they share both lithe and there's a sense of confident caution in their eyes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:07]** Aye.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:23]** So from a metagame perspective, sorry, before you go on, metagame perspective, we were talking about whether or not this base was hacking the stewards or if it was hacking the reptiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** I bet these people are prisoners.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** Disconfirmed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:27]** You think so?

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** Yeah, that's possible.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** But they wouldn't have the equipment to do that then.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:33]** This is some kind of off-worlder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:42]** Yeah, but the preamble was that this all looked like it was recreated from, like it was rebuilt from some refuge that was left on the surface of the planet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:45]** Okay, I'm tracking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:48]** So they could be prisoners of the Reptoids or the actual stewards.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:52]** But, John, what do they say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** The woman speaks up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:35:56 - 00:36:02]** If you are not Stuart, prove it.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:09]** I am going to cast a spell that will ensure that you will tell the truth.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:11]** Do you all accept?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:16]** Level three, detector up to it.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** Aye, I've got nothing to hide.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:19]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:28]** Her mouth begins uttering in a language that maybe Dr. Okay, that, you know, it's not of any significance.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:40]** It's just this magic sense, but it's the same word over and over and over again, as if trying to draw home the emphasis on the truth.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:46]** I'm going to draw a 20 foot by 20 foot area circle.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:58]** And as the words leave her lips, speaking of Dune prophecy, I think of this a little bit like in Dune, if you know the zone of silence that they have.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:06]** Dr. Okay, and here's, and maybe Colin, you recognize that this is a zone of truth.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Right.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:11]** And it comes down in this like yellow, purple.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:15]** Please, step inside all of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** I'm locked.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** Does that work like a lasso?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:20]** What's up?

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** Yeah, I was going to say that's what I thought too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** Does it work like Wonder Woman's lasso?

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:28]** Like whatever we say is the truth or are they actually like detecting our thoughts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:28]** Great question.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:35]** Creatures within the emanation area can't speak any deliberate or and intentional lies.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:42]** Each potentially affected creature can attempt a will saving throw to avoid the effect when the spell is cast or when that creature first enters the area.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:54]** Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment and can therefore avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie or they can be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** Creatures who leave the area are free to speak as they choose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:04]** Can we throw a free will save or do they know that we throw the will save against it?

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:05]** No, John's running away.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:06]** Don't run away.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:08]** He's letting the cat out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:10]** I can't move into the cone.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Sorry.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** A force has...

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** Immobilized me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:18]** Some sort of interstellar force.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:22]** Some sort of foundry of power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:29]** It's actually a 20-foot radius, so it's kind of a huge... Did I even have to move?

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:29]** No.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:31]** I don't think so.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** One, two, three, four.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:33]** Whatever.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** That's fine.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:34]** Is this it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** This is roughly it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** We are not stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** I'm not a steward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:40]** Nope.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** None of us are stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:43]** We were captives.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:44]** Next question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** And what about you?

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:48]** We escaped from the steward's face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** Are you all in the zone of truth?

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** Does yours know this?

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Yes, you are also there.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:56]** Also, all of you may give me a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** I failed.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** I got an 11.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:01]** I got a 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:05]** Wait, what are we rolling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** Will save.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:10]** So, Rick, you failed with an 11.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:11]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** got a 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:16]** I rolled a one on the die for a five.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:22]** Here's you also passed with an 18.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:27]** And Colin, you failed with a five.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:35]** I don't think that there's anything that is preventing you from, like, you don't need to share it.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:39]** I don't think it needs to be clear that you've passed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** And that means I can lie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** That means that you can lie.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:48]** You can also, you know, say what you want within the boundaries of the truth, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:52]** But like people who failed the will save can still avoid questions.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:53]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** What does the text of the spell say?

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** You all can, you can obviously Google this.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:00]** This is not, that's fine.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:06]** You can avoid answering questions to which you would normally respond with a lie or just be evasive and respond within the boundaries of the truth.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** There's no reason to lie about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:10]** All right.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:12]** Yeah, I'm not a steward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** Definitely not.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** Pretty notable pirate, actually.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:18]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** All right.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:24]** Let's not take the Zone of Truth too seriously now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** You guys might want an autograph.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** With whom did you serve, Sheeran?

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** From our understanding, he was a member of the Free Captains.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:56]** okay all right everyone okay yeah i was just outing him yeah i was i was a free captain i no longer am i'm more of a free agent now and my only allegiances are to this group of of people

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** And yourselves, what are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:00]** We.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:08]** Real quick, before you answer that question, would you mind stepping forward into the same zone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Can you come a little closer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:18]** Seems fair that we would all have the same baseline of truth and honesty among us.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:21]** We will decide if we will enter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:28]** Are you here for our final test?

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:32]** Because I am suspect if you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:35]** You say you're not stewards.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:36]** I'm sorry.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:38]** Can you explain what is the final test?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** What are their other tests?

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:40]** Did we miss tests?

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** They look at each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** Is there homework that I forgot to take down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** And they're confused.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:48]** But we've accomplished the mission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** What was the mission?


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:51]** They don't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:56]** They both hold up a finger to their lips.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** Were you guys going to undermine the stewards?

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** Because we want in.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:05]** I don't think that they know about the truth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:13]** One last question.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:15]** He looks.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:21]** Nix, you may ask.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** Where is...

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:25]** The Palace Obscura.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:28]** The Palace Obscura.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** Is there a rule check for that?

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** Yeah, a culture check or something?

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** Give me a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:38]** Or maybe a mysticism check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** I got a 29 on culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** 29 on culture.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** 22 mysticism.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** 22 mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:50]** Uh, only 15 mysticism.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:55]** It's not, that's not good for, for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:55]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:42:55 - 00:43:01]** You would recall it's tough because it's in the back of your mind.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:15]** You kind of just know the headline because there's literally almost nothing about this online, but you've heard of, is it an organization?

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** Is it a school?

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:21]** Is it training grounds?

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** Is it a person?

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** What's it called again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** Palace Obscura.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:34]** It's so... People don't talk about it in the same way that, to use Harry Potter, like saying Voldemort's name.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:38]** It's like you don't even want to say it because you don't know.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** It's a bad place.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** Bad time.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** It's bad place, bad time, bad person.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:48]** Again, you players don't Google it yet because you'll get some more, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:52]** I will ask one more time.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** Ask next.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:57]** Where is the Palace Obscura?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:05]** As she turns, you can hear her be like, I'm thinking that they don't know about the test, that they are not here for the test.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:07]** We are definitely not here for the test.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** Would we know where it is?

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:13]** Like through any... You don't even know if it's a place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:16]** You don't even know what's... It's clearly a palace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:21]** Well, I see that is most unfortunate for you.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:31]** Perhaps next time you might be a little bit more keen, intelligent with your answers.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** Unfortunately, there is no more next time for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:36]** Uh, f*** this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:37]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** Rick shoots.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:43]** Rick just fires.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:43]** Just shoots.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:46]** Just shoots himself in the foot.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** Just like, alright, here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** Somehow, somehow I...

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** I don't want to say I told you so.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:55]** So I'm going to say something else.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** I was right.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** That's what I was going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:04]** Is this first combat post TBE, Tercalos Base Explosion?

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:04]** Yes, it is.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** I'm popping out my sheets.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:11]** Just want to give a quick thank you to Foundry and all the awesome things that allow you to do things like pop out sheets.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:15]** Pretty sweet.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** What did you roll, Dr. K?

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** I can add it for you.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** 16.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** You rolled a 16.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:21]** And that's your total?

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** That's total.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:22]** Total.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** 16.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** 14 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:26]** Okay.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** Yeah, mine is screwed up, too.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:29]** I rolled a 13 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:31]** And what's your 13 total?

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** Mine worked.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:49]** great so mine added like 0.02 for some reason so the 0.02 is uh that's a module that allows you to when you have a tie it breaks it it breaks it breaks your text right so that two is your dex modifier yeah fancy


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:49 - 00:46:14]** fancy pants foundry mcgee all right rick 19 what are you doing first combat tbe ptbe so rick's already got his gun out and on his shoulder but he just raises it up and points it right at um the one that was talking and then says the man the man sure uh we we don't want to fight but we will

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:21]** and he's going to delay an action to open fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:22]** Delay an action to open fire?

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:32]** So Rick will fight or will shoot at that person if either of them does a violent action towards us.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** Okay.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** Well, we know they're going to cast a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** So that's ready an action.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** You're going to ready an action.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:38]** Get ready action.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** Okay, you're going to ready an action.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** It's been a long time.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:44]** And to be clear, if it's an offensive action, then your action will go...

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:45]** Before or after?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:46]** After.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** It'll go after their action.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** Okay.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** Sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** Yeah.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** Defensive actions take first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:54]** Here's a question for you.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:59]** What did you get in your initiative roll?

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** 13.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:00]** 13.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:00]** Okay.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:04]** So Rick19, take a defensive action.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:12]** Or sorry, you take a readied action to shoot in case they do any sort of offensive action near you.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** Okay.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:14]** Understood.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** It's the man's turn.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:20]** He referred to the woman as Nix.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:28]** Nix looks at him and he nods and he opens the door, runs inside and shuts the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:49]** jerk wow that's uh yeah wait wait wait no no no no door was shut so move action to open the door he can open the door and run inside that's fair he can he can go inside and run inside that's fair


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** Okay.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** You see him run inside.

**[00:47:51 - 00:48:03]** Inside looks pretty bleak from what you can see, but you can see that there's some sort of power computation device in the middle of the room with cables coming out from underneath it, and he runs over to that.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:07]** It is Nyx's turn.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:09]** I'm going to begin combat here since I forgot to do that.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:14]** Rick19, don't forget that you are still somewhat injured.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:16]** Rick19, you have raised your weapon.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:16]** Is that correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:21]** My gun is trained on the man who ran inside.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:22]** Okay.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:23]** What did you say he ran next to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:37]** He ran inside and ran next to some sort of, like, you would recognize it as a battery, as a data storage device, something inside that seems to be powering a light and some other devices that are inside.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:41]** Maybe depending on where you're at, you can't quite see everything inside.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** Okay, keeping it moving.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:46]** Nyx, the woman, is going.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** Rick19, what weapon do you have out?

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** My artillery laser.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:51]** Artillery laser.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** What level is that artillery laser?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** I don't know.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:55]** Okay.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** How do I know that?

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** It's probably level one.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** It perhaps could be 12 for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** If you click on it, it says item level.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:03]** Okay.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** In your hero lab.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** Okay.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** I'm clicking on it.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:09]** It is level one.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:10]** It's a level one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Okay.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:11]** Pretty cool.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** Pretty cool.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** Rick 19.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** She looks at you and smiles.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:17]** I need you to roll.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** Oh, we'll save.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Brick 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:22]** We'll save!

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:23]** We'll save!


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** What's up?

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** Great.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:32]** You asked for we'll save right when Safari is popping up this AI explanation of... What a we'll save is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:35]** We'll save is a weekly Starfinder podcast.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:38]** Absolutely.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:41]** We'll save is a weekly Starfinder podcast.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:44]** There's a two on a die plus five for seven total.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** Seven.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:54]** She says, why don't you go inside to see what my brother Cairo is doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:02]** And you have been charmed, Rick19, with a successful charm person.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:08]** So I cannot control you as if you were an automaton, but I can.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:18]** You are considered my trusted friend and ally, and we have a friendly attitude, and I can give you these suggestions.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:21]** Resist, Rick.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:29]** You can only resist if you're being suggested to do something that you wouldn't ordinarily do.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:31]** Kev, what was it that you rolled?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** You rolled a seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:33]** A seven?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:34]** Okay.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** I rolled a two on the die.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** I don't know what you're asking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** Nope, you're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:40]** Do I wait until my action to do that, or do I do it?

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:42]** That's a great question.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:43]** So I readied my action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:43]** I know.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:44]** So that way you can do it.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:47]** So it feels like maybe because you readied your action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:50]** But that's technically not an attack.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:56]** I don't know if Charm version, especially the one that's Charmed, would not think that that's... Right, and you failed the Charm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** That's the thing.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:04]** If you succeeded at the will save, then I'd say maybe you would then attack.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** But I think you take your action.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:12]** Because the unique confluence of you having a ready to action and her saying that, I think that you would go inside.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:14]** Otherwise, I think you do wait until your turn.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:18]** But since you're ready to action, I think you go at the end of her turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** Wait, wait, sorry.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** Say that again?

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** Because I'm saying I wouldn't.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:26]** I would wait until the end of the round to use my action because that was not an aggressive action.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** And so he wouldn't open fire on anybody.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** That was his ready to action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:35]** I think your action then changes based on her influence.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:39]** And because you readied it as a response to her, you would then take your action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:42]** Which... Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:42]** Okay.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:48]** So you're saying I should... The implication is that she's leading you into a trap to metagame a little bit.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** Not that that's of use to anyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:58]** If you had taken your turn, I think already, where you were at the top of the round, I think what would have happened is you would have waited until the next round.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:01]** And then you would have gone in.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:01]** That's my sense.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** But because you radiated an action...

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** you do it now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** But my ready to action was to ready to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:13]** Right, but now that you're friendly, you still haven't spent an action, so I think that you would still go next, pretty much.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** You would walk inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** Okay.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:26]** He's not... He just kind of looks back at his friends and just shrugs his shoulders.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** Guys, it's fine.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** And...

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** I'm going to walk in.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** Wait, hold on.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** What is my movement?

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:36]** 25 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** You know what?

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** Classic will save.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** First, second turn of the round.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** We're already talking about the rules.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Trying to figure out the thing.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:49]** Rick19, when you walk inside, you see that this is a small 20 by 20 space.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** Very dirty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:54]** Is my ready to action to shoot still active?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:58]** No, because I think your action became walking in.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** I don't like this.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** Okay.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:02]** When you walk in, you... Did you move me in initiative order?

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** So move me in initiative order.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:04]** Oh, yeah, that's true.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:06]** I can put you right after her, right?

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** That's... Yeah.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:18]** So while I'm doing that, Rick19, what you see inside is you see off to the right, you see three or six cargo containers kind of stacked inside.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:28]** And then what you see is... And then you see cables running from a light that is right in front of them that connect to, again, some sort of data power device in the center of the room.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:33]** And then leading to the left, there seems to be a console that...

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:57]** is where they can give commands a computer connection to some devices two cots you see and off in the upper left you see that that same bubbling yellow mud that's outside is also inside as part of the floor has given away i'm gonna go ahead and move over it is dr okay's turn what are you doing dr okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:05]** is going to reach down and grab one of his remaining pheromone grenades.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:17]** And just toss it inside to cover the radius of both of our Suggester slash...

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:37]** palace obscure uh folk yeah let's see what happens okay does the pheromone that is that's basically a charmed person uh it's a paralyzing scent affects the brain they become uh it's 20 20 foot range blast radius


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:40]** Oh, so it's the same size as... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:47]** So I'm like aiming for this square here, kind of near the doorway to cover both people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:48]** Okay.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** And... But it would also affect me though, right?

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** It would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** Yes.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:59]** They become fascinated for two rounds because of mark two fascinated for two rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:05]** This is awesome Okay, and what is the DC for that you throw it?

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:08]** Well first you have to roll to see if you hit this square, right?

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** Yeah, you got a roll range attack.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** Give me that roll.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** Okay 21

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:13]** 21.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** Easy.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:18]** It was, you know, 85 to hit that intersection of that square.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:21]** I think it was 10 because it's one extra range increment.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:22]** Thank you.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:22]** Yeah.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:22]** Yeah.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:23]** That makes sense.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:24]** That makes sense.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:24]** Appreciate that honesty.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:27]** You throw it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:57]** starts leaking out what do i need to roll and what does kevin need to roll i'm i don't see it says saving throws when unattended plus eight but i don't see any other name so it says a will saving throw yeah but it doesn't say this puts me in a predicament it does it does put you in it puts all of us in a predicament it's good uh yeah i i don't see what the dc is either


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:57]** Oh, okay.

**[00:55:57 - 00:56:08]** So it's the DC of the save is equal to 10 plus half the grenade's item level plus your dex modifier.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:09]** Nice.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** Okay, so what's your dex mod?

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** Plus two.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:13]** So it would be... 13?

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:15]** Okay.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** We'll save DC 13.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:19]** Rick19, how did you do?

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** I got a 24.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** Got a 24.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:24]** You are set, my guy.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** You are good.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** But I'm still charmed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:30]** So not fascinated, but charmed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:36]** Dr. K, you see Nyx look and say, What did you do to my brother?

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:41]** And maybe you look inside and see that her brother is like...

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:43]** Oh, man.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:47]** Looking at the bubbling mud.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:50]** That is so bright right there.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:51]** That's incredible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** Nicely done.

**[00:56:54 - 00:57:00]** May have disarmed whatever trap they were trying to pull by luring Rick and my team inside.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:01]** It's for two rounds.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:03]** How long is charmed condition?

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** That's a great, super good question.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:08]** Charmed is for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:10]** Charmed person is one hour per level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** Nailed it.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:14]** So it's for an hour.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:22]** The thing is that any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed creature breaks the spell.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:25]** Does that include setting off a trap?

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:26]** You didn't set off a trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:30]** But the person who charmed was this chick that's outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:50]** right so anything to get blasted at any time that you are attacked by either one of them rick you will then be uncharted but not but if they trigger the the trap if we see them push the button that triggers a trap who said there's a trap is that included who said there's a trap you did nope no you literally just said that

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:54]** He's so fascinated he didn't do his trap.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** Alright, good talk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:59]** With that said, Colin Edenbrand, what would you like to do?

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:02]** Dr. K's phenomenal quick thinking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:02]** Oh yeah, thank you.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:06]** The chick with the vapor cavitation pistol.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** Fire away, dog.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:07]** Let's go.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:10]** Let me make sure I have my...

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:10]** Bernice's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** So you threw a grenade and you're going to fire?

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** Dr. K threw a grenade.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:13]** Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:16]** I haven't moved, and I can instruct Bernice.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:16]** Oh, Bernice.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:17]** You said Bernice.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** Sorry.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** Sweet.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:21]** I love Bernice.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:23]** Bernice got a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:25]** Got a 16 against EAC or KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** I forget.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:28]** EAC, I think.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:34]** It's a vapor cavitation pistol, fire damage, lightning and fire damage, plasma damage, I guess.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** Totally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:35]** Okay.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** Yeah.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** That...

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:42]** is a hit as she is part of her skin is further tarnished.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:44]** Well done.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:44]** Well done.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:51]** I need to check if I need to make a Castro level check to maintain four points of damage.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** I don't think I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** No, it's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** If I need to, it's fine.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:54]** Yeah.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:55]** There's no concentration needed.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:56]** Thank you.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** Four points of damage.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** It's energy and fire.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** The energy's in the fire.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:01]** It also pops the popcorn.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:02]** Okay.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** You fire.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:04]** Hits them.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** Well done.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:07]** First shot.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:07]** First damage.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** Awesome, Dr. Okay.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:11]** Smart thinking with that pheromone grenade.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** Fighting.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** Laser measure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:04]** And taps her on the shoulder and casts fatigue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** Fatigue.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:07]** Two questions.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:11]** One, do I get an AOO for you walking past me and or casting a spell?

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:31]** if she had a melee weapon out if she had a weapon out sure okay fortunately for you she did uh okay so you were gonna cast fatigue so what does that do is there a will save um that is a i make a melee attack against your eac against my eac yeah

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** You're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:46]** So you're good to tag So is this day's weariness or just fatigue fatigue?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:53]** Okay, excuse me So what happens to her she gets a fortitude safe fortitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:53]** Oh

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:55]** Okay.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:58]** She failed with an eight, I'm sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:05]** Then she is fatigued for six rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:08]** Yikes.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:08]** Okay.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:08]** Yikes, yikes, yikes.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:09]** Well done.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** You run inside.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:12]** How long does the pheromone grenade last?

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:14]** Do you need to roll against the fascination?

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:16]** It's just two rounds.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:21]** It lasts for two rounds, but it was instantaneous, so it's dissolved now.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:22]** Okay.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** Yeah.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:24]** Okay.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:25]** You run in.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:26]** Smart move.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:37]** You can see her body crumple as all the weight of whatever she's been going through seems to quadruple, exponentially increase on her body.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** Incredible.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:39]** You run inside.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:44]** You're standing behind her brother and Rick 19.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:47]** Here's what are you doing at the end of round one?

**[01:01:48 - 01:02:13]** she is you say she's crumples she's still in the fight she's she's still standing she her body like kind of like just uh you know like she clearly looks fatigued but she is still mechanically standing yes thank you for i'm going the blacks and her eyes get deeper yeah exactly she looks real tired yeah she takes some coffee all right i'm gonna uh mechanically she takes a minus two to strength and dex


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:40]** armor yeah so that reduces her ac that reduces her attack rolls yeah yeah pretty cool is she carrying anything because she's also she would also be uh if she has anything on her that's yeah her max carry capacity would would diminish she doesn't drop anything cool rick 19 question all right uh just just a note is that um to actually give an order is uh an opposed charisma check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:40 - 01:03:05]** to give an order i've right so the order that she gave me i should have been an opposed charisma check just saying we can move forward i think i'm just letting you know i do actually disagree with that because i think part of it is that she an affected a creature never obey disagree with the rules you can okay so it is unlikely to attempt to harm you but it is also unlikely to attack any of its true friends or allies the spell does not you can give the target suggestions


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:09]** but you must succeed in opposed charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't normally do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:10]** Right.

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:14]** I think all I said to you was why don't you go ahead and go see what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:16]** Rick wasn't going to go into a random building, John.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** Anyways, moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:20]** I think that's pretty, come on, that's pretty harmless.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:21]** This is pretty harmless.

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:23]** Why don't you go see what's going on inside?

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:25]** What my brother's doing inside.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:28]** Wait, did Rick just say he wouldn't go into a random building?

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:29]** I think he did.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:31]** I think he did say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:34]** This is the guy who was like, let's not even sleep and just go inside the building.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:37]** I don't know about that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:39]** One of you might have run in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:39]** Who knows?

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:39]** All right.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:41]** Here's what are you doing?

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:41]** All right.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:44]** So here's when I leveled up to level six.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:55]** I gained this Cache Capacitor class feature, which allows me to, especially at six, store one spell that I can reuse continuously.

**[01:03:55 - 01:04:03]** This includes things such as Supercharged Weapon, very luckily, and then also things like Magic Missile.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:27]** uh which is good so what i'm going to do to test this out um especially because i want to have guaranteed hits right now to try this out is going i'm going to store super uh excuse me magic missile in that and use that now so i'm going here's is going to charge excuse me had you previously stored magic missile i have not but there but you can you can put it in the cache and

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:30]** and cast it all at once, so it's part of your casting.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:33]** In other words, I can use it immediately.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:33]** Yes.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** So I'm going to do that.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:48]** And then I also have something called Harmful Spells, which allows me to gain extra damage up to, well, exactly at half of my Technomancer class.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:52]** So he's going to do that.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:57]** So he's going to roll Magic Missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:21]** um the the difference is john is that like if i want to change these out i have to wait until i long rest or after 24 hours expires that's like the trade-off aren't you changing it out now though go ahead not for the first time it doesn't matter it's changed yeah oh yeah it doesn't matter for the first time it's like a memorization of a spell that's awesome yeah cool love it yeah are you doing this or ah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:26]** It depends on what you want to do with your magic missile.

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:28]** I'm going to do a full action to get one extra missile.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** So just give me one second, okay?

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:35]** Because I got to roll these in like... I'm just now remembering in like a dice thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:36]** Yeah, no worries.

**[01:05:36 - 01:05:37]** So hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:39]** Okay, so you... Awesome.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:44]** Yeah, because Hero Lab does not have something built in for that, unfortunately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:50]** Yeah, so you are, so you pull out, is it a physical device that you're using?

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:51]** No, it's just like a, no.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:52]** It's just part of.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:53]** It's a place in your mind.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:54]** My magical abilities.

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:57]** It's a magic chest in your mind that you go into.

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:02]** And you are pulling out this magic missile, making it extra harmful, casting it at.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:03]** Correct.

**[01:06:03 - 01:06:04]** At the woman.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:05]** At Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:06]** At the woman.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:07]** Yeah.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:06:08 - 01:06:09]** No, not Will.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:10]** Give me a sec.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** It's been a while since we played.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:14]** I want to make sure that I remember how this works.

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:16]** So it's 3D.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]** It's normally 3D4, right?

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:20]** 3D4 plus 1.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:23]** 3D4 plus 3 is the normal thing in this case.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:27]** So then that's 3, 4.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:31]** So it's 1D4 plus 1 three times.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:34]** No, so it's 1D4 plus 1 three times.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:34]** That's exactly it.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:35]** Yeah, that's what I did.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:37]** 1D4 plus 1 three times.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:37]** No, that's okay.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:39]** Don't you have extra damage?

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:40]** Yeah, I'm getting there.

**[01:06:40 - 01:06:41]** I'm getting there.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:41]** All right.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:44]** So three, four, five, plus three.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:46]** So 12 plus three is 15.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:48]** Yeah, exactly.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:49]** So that's 15 damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:50]** 15 damage.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:53]** Wait, what's the base?

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:55]** I already added.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:59]** Okay, incredible.

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:01]** That was really dope.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:03]** So, continuing on.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:04]** That is awesome damage.

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:06]** You are like boom, boom, boom.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:08]** Like hit after hit after hit.

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:12]** She is first getting hit by Bernice, then getting hit by Colin, then now getting hit by Hears.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:14]** I mean, she's out there.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:17]** The other guy left her.

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:18]** So, who knows?

**[01:07:18 - 01:07:19]** Top of round two.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:25]** This individual is just standing quietly.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:25]** Wow.

**[01:07:25 - 01:07:26]** Fascinating.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:28]** Those bubbles are just bubbling.

**[01:07:28 - 01:07:29]** Not really speaking.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:29]** Quiet.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:37]** And then they'll be fascinated for the third round.

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:38]** Yeah, it's one round.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:39]** Cool.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:50]** Well, the woman, Nyx, is going to look inside.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:58]** At Rick19, maybe you look at her and you smile because you're her friend.

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:03]** You're like, hey, hey, I'm in here.

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:04]** And her eyes.
