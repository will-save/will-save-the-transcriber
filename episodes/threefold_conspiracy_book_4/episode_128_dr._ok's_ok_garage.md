**[00:02:37 - 00:02:42]** The other weekend, I went to see the movie Baby Girl.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** And I think it's...

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** Strange, but worth the watch.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:50]** Like great for exactly what it is.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:53]** I had a, does everyone know what it's about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:55]** I've never even heard of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:55]** Okay.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** All right.

**[00:02:56 - 00:03:07]** It's about a high power CEO played by Nicole Kidman, who starts up an affair of a certain kink nature with an intern.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:13]** And it really just goes heavy into the kink.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:34]** very interesting very cool very weird but very well acted and very like cool side note i also didn't get to finish the movie because there was like an incident where like everyone just started running out of the theater it was really weird that was also weird yeah that was so it's just the true story is is it unrelated to the movie not at all we we were watching the movie and then we heard somebody like off in the distance go like hi where is it

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:58]** and then we're like what the so like we go look there was no one there and then a few minutes later people just started leaving and there was like 10 minutes left envy so we didn't actually finish the movie yeah and the ending was was like building to this moment which i knew was either going to be really weird or really good or both and i was really excited uh so that was uh

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** Fun, crazy time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:03]** For reference, just because I want to see where this lands on the scale.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Have you seen Salt Burn?

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** Oh, yeah, I've seen Salt Burn.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:07]** Yes.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:07]** Okay.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:11]** Anything, like, in that vein?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:14]** Not as shocking, but it is definitely...

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:40]** as deep let's say in terms of what they go into so for sure yeah uh that's definitely yeah there's definitely a lot there uh very strange but good so my question to you all is what are some like strange movies that you would recommend that's not salt burn unless the salt burn which is cool but you know like what's like a strange movie that you've seen that you're like all right just bear with me and watch it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:40 - 00:05:00]** is salt burn a movie or a series it's a movie it's a movie okay because i i recommend series uh yellow jackets if you guys haven't seen that yet it is survival horror but it also has this like supernatural twist to it that is unexpected and strange and

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:07]** I was able to watch season one, but I'm struggling to find season two and three.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:12]** Because season three is coming out soon, and season two is not available on any of my platforms.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:15]** But Yellowjacket's really, really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:18]** Lend Kevin your platform so he can watch season whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:21]** Well, it's on Showtime, and then nobody has Showtime.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:24]** And I'm not going to pay you an extra $40 for one show.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** That's so stupid.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** $40?

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:26]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** Showtime's always hella cheap.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:31]** I feel like they're always like, hey, get three, get like nine months for $3.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:36]** I'll binge watch it on the free weekend if it's on cable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:39]** Yeah, right.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** I haven't had traditional TV in a long time.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:46]** But it is... I don't know.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:46]** I don't like it.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:48]** Anyway, that's just a random thought.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** But cool.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:49]** I'll check that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** Thank you for that thought.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:53]** That was a great thought.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:55]** I hate commercials.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:55]** I don't like them.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:59]** Well, you can't get rid of them now on streaming unless you pay for it.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** Which I still figured out.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:01]** Is it better?

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** I mean, Hulu's the only one that does that.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:05]** to pay for the ads or to not pay for the ads?

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:08]** Do you stick it to the streaming company or do you stick it to the advertisers?

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** No, you stick it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:12]** You stick it to both of them by going on torrent.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** Ah, that's true.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:17]** But if you if you have to choose, you should stick to streaming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:24]** I mean, I reverted back to my my childhood where like on the during the ads, I run and take a piss break or go refill my drink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:26]** That is like you have no control.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:28]** Yeah, whatever.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:32]** At least the streaming companies you can choose when you want to watch something.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** You know what I mean?

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:34]** Like, that's true.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:36]** And then cable, there's always a janky remote.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** It's super slow.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** It's like a bunch of lag.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:38]** It's the worst.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** Hate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:44]** But don't you wish that you could have that feeling of like being in the other room and somebody's like, it's on.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:47]** And then you like can scramble real hard and run around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:51]** Imagine you're eating a really delicious dessert that you've been waiting a week to eat.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:54]** And then in the middle of eating a dessert, someone says, hold on just a second.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:59]** And they take the spoon out of your hand and then they talk to you about something that they want you to know about, that they want you to buy.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:04]** And then after five minutes, they put the spoon back in your hand and that happens every freaking 15 minutes.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** It's the worst thing ever.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** That's what a commercial is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:11]** That is the best description of commercial breaks I think I've ever heard in my life.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** That is spectacular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** That's how I feel.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:17]** I can't do it anymore.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:18]** So it makes sense.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** Kevin, Kevin lives like 20 years ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:25]** So imagine, imagine your, your lovely dessert presentation is interrupted by a timeshare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** Like, yeah, that's exactly it.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:33]** And then occasionally, occasionally the same pitch happens again.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:33]** Right.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:35]** So the same commercial will come back.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:40]** So imagine if the person's like, Oh yeah, literally in front of you tells you the same exact thing again.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:43]** Are you interested in purchasing a timeshare?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:45]** Yeah, a timeshare.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:49]** Well, and then I think muting them is just punching them in the mouth so they stop talking.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:51]** Well, that part would be fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:56]** I actually almost punched a timeshare salesperson one time.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** He's like, are you a man?

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** You should buy this timeshare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:03]** And I was like, what the f*** did you just say to me, dude?

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:05]** What does that even mean?

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:07]** Challenge your timeshares.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:11]** Ruined by fractional ownership of a property.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:12]** Wow.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:14]** That's what men do.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** They rush decisions.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** That's what men do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:24]** I also feel like there was kind of a supernatural element where he's like, are you a man?

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** He's an alien being like, are you a human male?

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** You should buy a timeshare.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:31]** What if aliens came here and were like, hey, do you want to buy a timeshare on another planet?

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** Buy this totally normal human timeshare.


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:37]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** Greetings, fellow human.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:41]** I know a totally normal amount about timeshares.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** Hey, so have you bought any good timeshares lately?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:54]** Let me take out a second mortgage on my own vacation home just to pay for this timeshare.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** Oh my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:55]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:55 - 00:09:01]** The best part is that the one timeshare person who's talking about like actual time sharing.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:02]** That'd be cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:09]** And you missed that because you're like, no, time shares.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** They screw up the transliteration.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** It's actually a time chair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:16]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:41]** you said it will has one of those yeah yeah i think that's just will's daily life that's this he's just he's sitting in the chair he goes back 12 hours you know that's it yeah yeah he has like uh what's that blue thing that i haven't seen enough doctor who i don't know anything about i think it's just like a time traveling thing the tardis the tardis is it just a time come on man it travels across space and time both yeah yeah yeah i feel like that's weird


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** That's what he has.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:43]** Is he the doctor?

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Or am I just a companion?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** You're probably the doctor.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:52]** I feel like he's slightly more jaded than the doctor, it seems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:56]** I know enough about the doctor to... Not in a bad way.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Maybe he's the first doctor.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:00]** They never really talked about the first doctor, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:00]** Right.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:04]** And, I mean, the war doctor was pretty jaded.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Who's that?

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** Is that the most recent one?

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:10]** I don't know anything about Doctor Who, man.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:19]** He was one of the older ones made a brief appearance in a Christmas or like inner series special like four or five years ago.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:27]** But it was basically like he was the doctor who orchestrated the end of the war with the Daleks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** Spoiler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** Next time at night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** I didn't even know about that war.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:31]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:35]** I knew about that war and I know nothing about Doctor Who.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:38]** The statute of limitations expired on that a long time ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:38]** Got it.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Got it.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:47]** I did randomly once watch my dad, of course, had on like a BBC channel that was playing old Doctor Who, like 70s and 80s Doctor Who.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** The TV series?

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:50]** It was kind of awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:50 - 00:11:04]** not gonna lie it was it was it was pretty cool to like just see that story from that era yeah speaking of statues uh man the statue episode of doctor who is the only episode i've ever seen and that's why i've never watched another episode of doctor who


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:05]** Don't blink.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** Oh, the angels.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:09]** Yeah.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** That's the creepy thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** Wait, what's that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:14]** Like the hand sticking out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:14]** He's taking notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:20]** It's, it's basically a, I'll just, I'll give you the synopsis so that you can just listen to me.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:21]** Tell you, you don't have to watch it.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** This is the episode now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:34]** Basically, all of the weeping angels that you see in like morgues that have their faces covered with their hands are actually an alien race, right?

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:37]** So they can only move when they are not observed.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** They're quantumly.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** Isn't it like quantum or something?

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:41]** Yeah.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:44]** So what they do is they steal time.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:45]** Yeah.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** So like if they touch you.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:53]** They send you back in time and steal whatever the rest of your current timeline was.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** And that's what they live on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:56]** It's pretty sweet.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** It's pretty creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** It's so scary.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** They do it pretty well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** It's so scary.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** Yeah.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:08]** It's because they bring their hands down and it's like the blank eyes and the real pointy teeth.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Yeah, wild visage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:14]** But they're right behind you because as soon as you turn around, they freeze.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:14]** Yeah.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** And then...

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:57 - 00:12:58]** Yeah.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** Thank you.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** That's great.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** I'm down for this.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:06]** One of my favorite movies, though, doesn't get a lot of...

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:32]** like airtime or you know dark city dark city jennifer connelly keifer sello and rufus sello it's good it's such a big crush on jennifer connelly same my entire life who who didn't okay all right didn't expect somebody to answer choose any all right geez we're gonna ruin it all right pan's labyrinth is also pretty weird dark city pan's labyrinth is cool


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** Ooh, okay.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** Thank you for that.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** That's going to be my go-with-me movie.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:42]** Labyrinth.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** Not Pan's Labyrinth, but Labyrinth.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:46]** The original Labyrinth with Jennifer Connelly.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:48]** That movie makes no sense at all.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:50]** Are you kidding?

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:53]** The first time I watched it, I was like three-quarters drunk.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** I was like, oh, I was drunk.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** That's why it doesn't make sense.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** I watched it the next day.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** I was like, nope.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** Zero fucking sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:03]** Apparently it's all a metaphor for becoming a woman.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** Yeah.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:07]** And it's all about her menstruating for the first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:12]** What's David Bowie a metaphor then in that movie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:13]** That I don't know.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** I forget.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** There's a whole breakdown of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:18]** I'm trying to find it on Google.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** I can't remember any weird movies.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:26]** I was just going to say, this is not weird at all, but you should watch, since we're talking about the BBC, you should watch Keeping Up Appearances.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** It's like a BBC show.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** Highly recommend it.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** I won't say anything other than that.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:34]** You should watch Hyacinth.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Or Bouquet, she likes to say.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** I'm keeping up appearances.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** That's a great show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:42]** It does big trouble in little China count as a weird movie.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:43]** Yes.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** I haven't seen it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:47]** Most definitely a weird movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** Yeah.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:48]** I have not seen that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** I don't know what they... It's not surreal, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:56]** Like, there are surreal films, and there are just weird films.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:58]** And then there are just real weird films.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:05]** I'm trying to think of one of the weirdest... I think we talked about it before in a different context, but, like, one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen was Tire, I think?

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** Is it rubber?


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** Tire?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:07]** Rubber?

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** Rubber.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** Rubber.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:10]** Is that the killer?

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:12]** Is that one of the tires that kill people?

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** It's a killer tire.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** That's all it is.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:15]** I love this.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** It's so good.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:20]** It's so strangely good.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:22]** I recommend it.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:22]** I'm down.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:30]** You go into it thinking this movie's going to suck, and then you keep watching it, and you're like, man, this is actually pretty good.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** That's actually pretty rad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:35]** And not just because of low expectations.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Whoever's playing that timer.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** Whoever plays the tires, really.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** Literally killing it.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** Yeah, it's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:45]** Quick reminder to everyone that Kevin once played Ron Howard in the movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:48]** Of weird movies.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:52]** Can I just share one that I'm really interested in watching now?

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** It's called Meat Love.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** Meat Love?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:58]** Meat as in like to meet someone or meat as in food?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** Meat as in food.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:02]** And the summary description of it is one line.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:06]** It says, two pieces of meat fall in love.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:09]** That's on a sausage party, right?

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:10]** That's a weird movie.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** I don't like that movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:13]** Yeah, that was a weird movie.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** I don't recommend Sausage Party.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:17]** There's like a spoon in it.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** It's like a side character.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** I guess that makes sense.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:21]** I'm so down to watch Meatloaf.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:21]** It sounds great.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:22]** I'm down.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:23]** It's short.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:24]** It's very short.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:25]** We'll watch it after this.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** It's one minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** We should put it in the food channel.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:29]** We'll save the movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** I'm down.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** We'll save Movie Night.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:33]** We're watching a real quick movie.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:34]** It's called Meatloaf.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** Yeah, Meatloaf.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:37]** It's exactly what you think it is.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** Guys, I want to do a quick shout out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:41]** Okay.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** To the makers of Meat Love.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:43]** Before we get started.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:50]** That was a good solid 20 minute banter about Meat Love and a lot of good things.

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** I want to shout out

**[00:16:53 - 00:17:11]** you for because i'm really because i'm really proud of y'all and you all are fantastic and even i'm so honored and lucky to be your gm so i just want to shout out y'all because y'all are amazing thanks john just wanted to kick it off a little bit of love you know what i'm saying yeah that's it yeah it's all good just a little positivity

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:39]** did you say a little positivity a little positivity uh that was uh that's from the the i don't remember if that was the seagull from the little mermaid or if that was from mary poppins one of the animal characters but it's like kind of 90s disney coded you're a real cinephile that one yeah you just nailed it really killed it ah the golden age at disney though i know honestly i gotta shut up oh another weird movie that i actually really liked


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:51]** that everyone hated Prisoners of the Ghost Land with Nick Cage Prisoners of the Ghost Land I think I've heard of that one Golden to be honest it's just strange Prisoners of the Ghost Land


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:57]** Oh, no, I'm thinking of, wasn't he in Angel City or Los Angeles or one of those, like some movie?

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:58]** Oh, City of Angels.

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:59]** City of Angels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** Yeah.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:00]** Which is actually about angels.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** That's like a real, like.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Yeah, that's a, yeah.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** That's a movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** That one was actually pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** Meg Ryan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:09]** Somehow he did pretty well at that.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:11]** In a weird way, which is normally what he's good at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:16]** Prisoners of the Ghost Land is described as an American horror Western film.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:18]** Yo, speaking of 90s.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** Meg Ryan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:23]** Oh, so no Jennifer Connelly, but Meg Ryan.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:24]** Really?

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** Her nose.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** That's fair.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:26]** Meg Ryan.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** That's just weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** I get it, though.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:29]** I understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:34]** Well, speaking of happy endings and wonderful things.

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** And heartthrobs.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** And heartthrobs.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:39]** Let's talk about her heart stopping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:43]** How you all murdered someone in cold blood.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:43]** I did not say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** I don't think it was cold outside.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:44]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:49]** Oh, also Nicole Kidman looks like a Draugr from Skyrim now.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** Not in a bad way.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** It's just, I don't know.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:55]** Whenever she's on something, I feel like I'm staring into the soul of like a Draugr.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:58]** I know someone mentioned her earlier.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** Look at her AMC commercial.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** It's creepy as ****.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Thank you for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:03]** She's in that baby girl film.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:03]** Thank you.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:04]** Yeah, that was really good.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:13]** That really helped contribute to this really tight, short banter that people know us for, that they really love and that they haven't skipped over already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:16]** People talk about not being able to get out of the doldrums.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:18]** We cannot get out of banter to save our lives.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** We can't.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:21]** We couldn't get out of the tech check and we're trying to get out of the banter.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:24]** It's just one of those things.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:30]** Look, last time you all had quite an interesting, let's say, fight at the Dome.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** A little different.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:40]** Started out with some testing questions, some unnerving tension.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** As they asked you to back up from the door.

**[00:19:43 - 00:20:00]** As when you showed up to the dome, these two individuals looking scrappy, wearing blue jumpsuits like they are cornered animals come out, cast a zone of truth, ask you if you know about the test, about where Hex House is or Palace Obscura.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:04]** They realized quickly that you all are not who they thought.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** And they said, you know what?

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** We got to kill you.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:17]** But instead, one of them, the woman, charms Rick 19 after the man runs inside to do something.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** You all begin fighting.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:27]** Dr. OK, I would say, and here's holding up the actual offensive front of like attacking, taking her down, just whittling her down.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:31]** Shot after shot after shot with Bernice inside.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:42]** Colin and Doc and Rick 19 trying to suss out what's happening as this man is bending over and until he was charmed he's bending over trying to pull something out of this data storage device and

**[00:20:44 - 00:21:00]** And in the last episode, when Rick 19, when you asked what's going on to this man, and then Colin breaks the fascination that he's under with this telekinetic projectile, he turns and says, essentially, you'll never find out.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:08]** And he throws this data storage device, kicks it, shoves it into this boiling pool of like superheated lava oil.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:16]** Outside, Dr. O'Kane hears, you kill the woman, this woman that he has referred to as Nyx.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:21]** And he runs outside and he sees her dead.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** And he says, one day.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** Dick's got 86.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:25]** Got 86.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:29]** Says, one day, you'll pay for all this.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:31]** And then he runs off.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:36]** I'm going to bring you guys on Foundry back to the site.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** The Dome.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** I'm going to unpause.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:40]** We are at the Dome.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:46]** Maybe the Dome wasn't quite what you thought it was.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** Rick19 thought that it was nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:51]** Instant resting place, in other words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** Not instant.

**[00:21:54 - 00:22:04]** I'll note, too, that Rick19, you reached in willingly into this superheated lava and pulled out the device within one round, hopefully maybe saving some part of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:11]** Well, and with that, Rick doesn't know that Nyx is dead and that the guy ran off, because he's still inside of the dome.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:12]** The door's open.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:13]** Right.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:15]** He can't see anything.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** That's true.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:16]** Yeah.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:23]** And I think that's what happens next, is that Rick walks out of the dome holding this data device...

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:52]** in almost like a haze because he doesn't he was charmed during most of that and when he steps outside he just sees the you know the results of everything the man's gone right he just sees nick's dead and the man's gone he probably i don't know if does he recognize any fuck well no i'm not gonna do survival check for that but he's holding the data device and he looks it around he goes wow uh you killed her where's the other


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:52 - 00:23:13]** uh he ran off that way and he points uh west south it was west right is he still a threat southwest uh i mean i don't know he said he'll we'll pay for this uh yeah so maybe

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** And Dr. O.K.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:19]** is going to walk over to the lifeless corpse of Nyx.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** And loot her body.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:32]** And bend down and touch her and start speaking in some incantation he learned in his dreams as he casts grave words.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:35]** Of course.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** Of course he casts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Fan favorite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** The fan favorite.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:43]** I forgot you had that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:49]** Didn't Grave Words, didn't you use it on the- Tormadin had it.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:54]** Yeah, but I thought you used it in book three.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** Maybe.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:55]** Two.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:56]** I'm sure I did.

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:00]** I think you used it for the stewards who were killed on Outpost Omicron.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:03]** You guys remember how you had that funeral service?

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** Roll a d10.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** You made it.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** 10% chance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:13]** I actually thought that was- Just get the corpse to animate again.


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:13]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:16]** Yeah, I just want to say, I thought about that the other day.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:27]** And actually, the more I think about that scene, Dr. OK and here staying back after the funeral, the more I think that it totally fits your characters.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:31]** I didn't think it was meant to be funny or strange.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:34]** I thought that it was meant to be an understanding thing.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:37]** It's like you're curious, and you're asking them.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** You're seeing what's going on.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** It was part of the process.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:43]** I actually thought that it was really, I don't know, you all did a good job with it.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** And maybe at first it was just like, why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** We respected it.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** We did it after the funeral.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:51]** I think Dr. O'Kate cast it after, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:56]** Yeah, it wasn't like the corpse was speaking in the funeral.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:58]** In the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:02]** That was very tastefully done.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:07]** He's just standing in the back like... So you bend down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** I think you have to touch them in order to do it.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:14]** You go up to the casket and hold their hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:16]** He did.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:19]** He opened the casket.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:24]** Presumably those are maybe still on the book.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:25]** Those bodies.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:28]** So you walk over to this Knicks individual.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:34]** You bend down, maybe roll her over.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** She's bald.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** Tattoos.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** Wearing that blue jumpsuit.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:43]** It's very easy to push her body over.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:44]** What kind of tattoos?

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:47]** She has tattoos that look really nice.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** Like they're really intricate.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** Really well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:52]** Can we do like a culture check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** Two full sleeves.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:59]** You don't need a culture check to know that somebody who's just getting whatever.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:01]** Tattoos and flashes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:05]** Any obscura imagery or anything like that we would know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:28]** no no nothing at all relating to palace obscura it just looks like generic things like prison tattoos yeah she had a teardrop teardrops spiders spider webs spider webs yep none of that they look really nice like she went to a really nice prison you know expensive art artist the prisoner she bunked with got an art degree from art center

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** They are old.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:31]** They are not new.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** Oh.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** Okay.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:36]** And she's only been in prison for some small amount of time, I guess.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** You don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:40]** I'm just trying to think of a joke, but I can't.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** It's not Barbara Walters.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:43]** Who's the one that went to prison?

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** Martha Stewart.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** Martha Stewart.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** Went to Martha Stewart's prison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:53]** Unfortunately, that's not the prison that is here on Veros.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:55 - 00:27:10]** It's safe to assume, though, that she... Her and Cairo, which I probably spelled wrong four different ways, that the two of them were prisoners that escaped from Terrapin probably before the takeover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:22]** Well, so if you recall, Colin, you saw something labeled the sauna when you ripped open Cairo's jacket in making a thing.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:26]** And maybe the sauna refers to Terrapin.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:29]** Maybe the sauna refers to a prison.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** Do you know if Terrapin's a prison?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:35]** My impression was that the prison was a separate space from Terrapin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:35]** Okay.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:39]** Well, we know there's a prison on this island or this planet.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** That was my impression.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** There's a prison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:43]** You would also know there's several.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:48]** This is a very remote, hostile moon.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:49]** Great place.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** It's like Mongolia.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** Sorry if you're Mongolian and listening.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** Yeah, that sounds really nice.

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** I was going to say Riker's Island.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** It's super nice.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:58]** Okay, yeah, that's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** John, I don't want to lose Alcatraz, maybe.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** The one person from Mongolia.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:02]** Alcatraz, yeah.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:05]** It's a population of, I know, like 400,000 people there.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** I just can't stop.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** Take it back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:09]** I can't stop.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** I can't.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:40]** all of that to say that you roll over her body okay all right so we're still on grave words you roll over her body it it moves over very easily she's for real real thin malnourished for sure damn there's a surprise look on her face it's only been a few minutes but you know her face is sort of freezing you speak your words you lay her hand on her shoulder maybe her neck tentacle

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:44]** You lay a tentacle.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:46]** It squelches as it lands.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:49]** Sounds like Jello the Shredder.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:52]** A little bit of the secretion hits the ground.

**[00:28:55 - 00:29:03]** There's a brief moment, and then her eyes go... No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** I will pass the test!

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** I will do it!

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:10]** I will get out of here and pass the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** That's it.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** Have we ever gotten anything useful from Grave Words?

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:18]** I feel like, what is it, a one in ten chance that you get some useful information?

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** Yeah.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:19]** I like it.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** It's a great thing to do.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:23]** I just one day want to get something useful from it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:26]** That's the problem is you won't know if it's actually useful.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** Not yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:27]** That one wasn't useful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:28]** Come on.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** I want to get out?

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** Is that what she said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:54]** i gotta get out i will get out of here i i want to get out of here out of the prison that makes sense i was trying to to decipher that last bit the the i will i will get past the or i will press the i wasn't sure which was like i i will get out of here i want to pass the test i i will pass the test okay that part's kind of useful actually


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:54 - 00:30:19]** and so it takes a second for rick to realize what you guys just did but then he realizes that it's you guys and you did great words and then he walks over and he's gotta see you guys he sets down the the device and he goes this might have our answers all right let's uh let's bring it back inside where it's not so hostile right question real quick dr k does she have anything on her i


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:43]** great question it could be clues she has yeah she has she's she's wearing an estex suit one she has manacles on her manacles yeah she has a tactical hand axe she has a sonic suppressor murmur that's the type that's the subtype of sonic suppressor

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:45]** And that's it.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** Take that sonic suppressor.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** Okay.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** Add it to your inventory on Hero Lab.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:53]** Unless anybody else wants it or wants it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:55]** I'll take the hand axe.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:55]** Okay.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:56]** I guess I'll take the manacles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** You never know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** You need another set.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** You might.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Sure.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** Yeah, Dr. O'Kane hears you haven't been inside the dome.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:11]** Maybe you saw inside and on, you know, on Foundry, you can see inside.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:18]** But the idea is that, you know, it's a dark room in what is otherwise a pretty light space outside.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:21]** So it's not the easiest to see everything in there for your characters.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** What do you all do?

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** It's starting to get to evening now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** I'm going to go inside.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:28]** Colin goes back inside.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:31]** Rick will follow with the device in his hands.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** Here's for sure is going in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:36]** Yeah, the inside is cozy.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** Cozy is a word.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:42]** There's still a bit of fire burning on that.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:53]** mud, and Dr. O'Kaye hears, you think maybe that's where, when you heard this sound, you can see the char marks.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:58]** the angry, really fiery char marks on that data storage device and also battery.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** And after a little while, it stops.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:05]** Let's take a look at this thing you rescued, Rick.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:08]** I would recommend that if you, so inside there are two beds.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:14]** There's a console where you can, where it can hook up to, right?

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:18]** So you could try hooking this back up because it's also a battery and a data storage.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:22]** And there is a light that if you recall, Nick's turned off that light.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:52]** in an effort to kind of create an uncertain environment and there are three storage container crates in the southeast let's look through the storage yeah i think colin is going to search the storage okay so colin and dr okay you're searching the storage here's and rick do you you searching the storage you trying to put this back together inside the connected to the cables the computer thing here's yeah that for sure the data tower let's call it seems like a hero's job

**[00:32:52 - 00:33:15]** yeah yeah okay i'll work on restoring making sure it's usable i guess okay i'll assist you plug it in and it starts for a second maybe you give it a little bit of the old whack or two and then it powers back up the light comes back on the console comes back to life nice

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:26]** Rick was able to save it, most of it, because even though it was submerged in the superheated oil, the housing, you know, it's like IP 160 rated.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** So it's fine.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:30]** You know, which is rated for superheated oil.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** Which would make sense on this planet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:35]** Like Dr. K. Oil in their computer's hours.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:36]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:36]** Yeah, you know.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** Yeah.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** You know, just that's what I do.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:40]** That's really cool, by the way.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:40]** Colin and Dr.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:43]** O.K., you start looking through the container's

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:51]** You see a lot of technological apparatus, apparati, for setting up comms and broadcast equipment.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** Some of it's been used.

**[00:33:54 - 00:34:05]** You also find 500 UPBs, which you know equal one credit, but UPB is a slightly different currency, you could say.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:06]** Ka-ching.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:06]** Ka-ching.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:21]** You also see that there are a lot of maintenance tools, items, specialty gear that you think, I might be able to use some of this in order to repair the vehicles.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:26]** So when we get to that, we can maybe try and do that.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:35]** This might allow you guys to put some popsicle sticks and glue on the vehicles in order to let it limp over to Terrapin.

**[00:34:35 - 00:35:00]** right yeah i'll say rick and here's you plug it in walk over to the console give me a computers check let's say i've got a 21 also bernice is gonna assist i assist and uh

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:19]** bernie's seeing them working on it it's gonna assist okay colin and dr okay as you're looking through this you see that some of the equipment here has the

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:24]** Well, some of it's sized for small folk.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** You could still use it.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** There's nothing wrong with it.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** It's all mostly fine because they make it one size.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:34]** But there are some gloves that you see are smaller.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:41]** You're looking, and on the gloves, there's the Ringworks symbol.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:43]** Okay.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:51]** Here's... And Rick19, you... With this awesome computer's check, you're going in, you're aided.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:53]** You see a couple things.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:56]** One of them appears that...

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:09]** This shell, this mainframe, is a Ringworks device that Nyx and Cairo must have co-opted, found.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:14]** It looked beat up before it was sent into the, you know, kicked into the oil.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** So maybe it was in here.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:18]** Maybe it was out back with the trash junk.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:25]** They got here and something was abandoned, something that Ringworks was some sort of a part of.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:41]** You boot it up and you see that on one hand, there's a set of data from maybe the past 48 hours, pretty much since you were at the same time period that you were at, um, tier Calis.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:47]** of all the unclassified comms that came through.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:53]** And you start looking around and you think, well, based on the footing of things, there was other equipment here.

**[00:36:54 - 00:37:06]** So they must have come in and hacked together this setup in order to jump into the comms channel that this dome must have already been monitoring.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:11]** And again, you knew this, but they must have, Nix and Cairo must have rebuilt it.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:14]** And they pulled in some of that data to see what's going on.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** And again, it's all unclassified stuff.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** There's nothing here about being a reptoid.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:24]** It's all things that are standard logs and stuff that's sent out on the daily, every hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:26]** Because the reptoid thing is classified.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:31]** That was behind a firewall that you had to go through in order to get it.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:38]** And you think, okay, there has to be something else here.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** And you see there's something behind a firewall.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:45]** Give me another computer's check here, or whoever wants to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** Can we assist or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** 31 again.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** Bernice will assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** Okay.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** I assist as well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:58]** You're in.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Excellent.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** A couple things.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:08]** One is that, well, they were desperate.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:15]** You can tell the tone from these messages that they're sending out.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:26]** If you think of the comms, just go with me for a second, as a visual imagery is like a trail of like a river of information you can see coming from Tyrcalis to Terrapin.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:32]** They are siphoning off an eddy and pulling it into this data device.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:35]** Then they're sending up something else back in.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:44]** They're trying to jump on that narrow band and send something out because they realize that that's a comms channel river that they can use.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:49]** So they sent something and it takes you a second because it's, it's encrypted.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:54]** So Cairo and Nick's were being, were acting desperately.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** Yeah.

**[00:38:56 - 00:39:01]** They were sending something out and you look and it's clearly tied to some sort of drive.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:11]** And you think maybe this is what Cairo, when he ran in, if he was trying to get something, maybe he was trying to get this, this, this drive that held this data.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:40]** It seems like there are these messages, Nix and Cairo refer to themselves, but only by their first name and kind of in a third person, there's no last name, but there's references of some sort of retribution or pressure or aggression that can come from them, maybe from their family, maybe from people that they know.

**[00:39:40 - 00:40:05]** they're angry they've sent these messages out they seem to be asking like we have done everything that you've asked we have approached the target we have survived incarceration we have escaped and we are ready for our entrance let's say


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:09]** This is what they're sending off in the data?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:09]** Yeah.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:14]** And everything is sent to somebody called Wraith.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:15]** W-R.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:18]** And they keep W-R-A-I-T-H.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** It's sent to some contact name, Wraith.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** And it references Hexhouse.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:31]** again, incessantly asking, when can we meet again?

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** We have achieved our goal.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:36]** We want to gain entrance.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:39]** We are ready for our entrance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** Well, that's swell.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:46]** So it's like a cult kind of thing that they're kind of, what's the word I'm looking for?

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:47]** Doing what they hear.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:51]** Kind of go and do some tests or something like that to help them out to get in.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** Yeah, what's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:52]** Yeah.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:56]** Are you able to determine where that message was trying to get to?

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:02]** I mean, I understand that you said it was Wraith, but do you have an IP address or a location?

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** An IP address, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:06]** That's not really how it works, Rick, but that's fine.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:08]** Let me see if I can figure it out.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Can I figure that out?

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** Let me see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:11]** Sure.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:14]** Give me another computer check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:19]** Is it an IPv6 that is also 128-bit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:20]** It's an IPV.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:21]** Episode 128.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:24]** Can you assist me?

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:30]** I know the IP thing you said or whatever, but I still would like to get some assistance from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Yes.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:36]** I think that... Is it IP or is it IPV?

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:38]** I forget exactly what it was called, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:41]** IPv6 is 128 bits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:44]** I definitely assist with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:50]** He's like, hey, check the headers in that message to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:50 - 00:42:00]** Bernice is stuck on trying to correct your terminology for IPv6 and fails to assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:07]** So it's a 25 in total with the assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:15]** Rick shushes Bernice and then repeats what she says two years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:18]** Bernice starts to pull the gun and then puts it back.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:23]** Put it away, Bernice.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:23]** No.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:23]** 25.


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** I'm probably going to get this wrong.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** I'll preface that.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:36]** And you more schooled, educated networks and folks here on the call and listening might, you know.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:37]** But you might get it.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:39]** I think you will.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:53]** The IP, let's say, the address for those out there who are not familiar with it, seems like it's headed to Leovara.

**[00:42:54 - 00:43:17]** looks like it's headed to liamara you think there's also if i'm using this term right it's it's like trying to reference a mac address like it's it's another layer down it's not just like the destination it's like it's trying to reference like a physical device id uh it

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:21]** device that it's trying to connect to, store on, access.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:22]** Thank you, Vinny.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:24]** Thank you for that golf clap.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** Hey, you know what?

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:25]** Thank you.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:28]** Just want to give a quick shout out to Avixa.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:32]** Thanks to Avixa for helping me learn some AV networking skills.

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:34]** Anyway, so with that said.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:41]** So there's more layers down than just let me send out a message to some server to land on somebody's thing.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:49]** And it's like you would know that it's an unusual Mac, like unusual in the sense that's like, is this like a smart fridge?

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:55]** Like what device are they trying to send a message to to be stored on?

**[00:43:55 - 00:44:05]** And you realize just with some other, let's say, triangulation, Starfinder science, that it's somewhere in the city of Roselight.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** Rose lights.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:10]** Bum, bum, bum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:12]** Roads lead to rose lights.

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:12]** You got that?

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Rose lights.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** So that's my explanation.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:15]** Right there.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:17]** That's where it's at.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:17]** That's where it's going.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** Again, to rose light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:20]** Copy.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** What do you all want to do?

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:24]** It's about six or seven.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** The sun is setting.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:29]** and make repairs to our vehicle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** I definitely would consider a rest.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:34]** I know that a couple of you are a little more tuckered out than I am.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** If you want to take the beds, I won't mind.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** There's only two, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:47]** I do think that I was right in the aspect that this dome does provide us the correct amount of coverage in order to take it.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** Yeah, that's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:48 - 00:45:05]** i think i think that i think the term you're looking for is lucky i think you were lucky even though it wasn't the wise thing to do it luck turned out okay for us this time but great that's good to know maybe i'll take the bed rick why don't you sleep on the floor over there

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** Okay.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:10]** I think you actually said, Rick, and I quote, there will probably be nobody at the dome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:16]** And you killed them as if they were no one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:16]** Wow.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:20]** I think you really do need some sleep.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** Glass houses and stones.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:28]** I'm just protecting now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:32]** I'm assuming that when you all were outside, you were using your environmental protection.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:35]** So I think that was maybe an hour outside.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:43]** So I think with everything else that you've had, with the time that the door was open and you started to use some at Tikal's base, maybe you've only used like two hours.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:49]** Don't forget that you have a number of days equal to the item level of your armor, I believe.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** So just keep track of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** But we're able to recharge?

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** Is there a power supply?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** There's not enough power here to also power your armor.

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:59]** But you've only used like two or three hours because you've mostly been in the vehicles.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** Right?

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:00]** Yeah.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** You probably want to... Let's see.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:06]** Who is going to work on the vehicles as you walk from sleep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:09]** I should... We can take more time.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** I would be helpful at it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:13]** I don't mind to work on the vehicles a bit.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Uh...

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:19]** while you take a rest and we can do shifts if necessary.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:21]** Yeah, let's do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:23]** I'll trade shifts with you.

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:25]** I think we have enough time to top everything off.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:29]** Bernice, let's go.

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:39]** If you don't mind, Colin, providing me with some... He looks down and he thinks about it twice, but he says, like, medical support.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:42]** Oh, I got you covered for that, bud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** Thank you, Dr. Roque.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:48]** I'll take whatever, because long resting doesn't actually heal your hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:53]** It heals either one or equal to your level.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** No, it's not one.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:57]** I think it's however much you have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:58]** All right.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:02]** Well, before we take this long rest, because you get your spell slots back, right?

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:26]** yeah it's it's yes it's one hp per character level so you'll get six hp back yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna uh just like reach in his back pocket and like flick out a thing and it looks like the um psychiatric stand from a charlie brown christmas that lucy is sitting in nice little sign that says the doctor is in

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:30]** That's awesome.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:32]** Rick, you look like you could use some help there.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Yes, please.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:35]** Come here a minute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:41]** You could get Rick some psychological help as well while you're at it.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:42]** That would be really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:46]** You know, I keep trying to click... I think that's more Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:46]** O.K.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:46]** 's territory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:51]** Mystic Cure, but then it's... I keep landing on Mind Thrust.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** I don't know what that deal is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:59]** Yeah, do it, do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** Cool, so I'm going to roll 3d8s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:01]** Jeez.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** That's for HP?

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** For SP.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** That's pretty good, bro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:08]** That's a second level Cure Wounds.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** Mystic Cure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:11]** Mystic Cure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:15]** Do you get that fully recharged?

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:19]** All of your spell shots slots, even at this level, get recharged on a full rest, right?

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:21]** Because you can top everyone off, really.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** That's kind of the plan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:25]** 17 hit points.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** That about tops me off.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** I can top you off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:29]** Thanks.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** Great, yeah.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:33]** Because I'm 5 short.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:38]** You got 5 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** Sweet, thank you.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** With my field dressing.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:43]** This should help out the last bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:44 - 00:49:00]** I kind of imagine that your field dressing, you use your secretion slash ooze as the salve a bit, and as the adhesive, you're like... Is anybody else in need of some... Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** Do me next, would you, Doc?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:02]** Thanks.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** Cool.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:11]** Oh, actually, I don't... Yeah, you actually get four more than that.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:11]** Oh, okay.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** I thought something else was going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:15]** Oh, I just ran out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** Oh, no, I'm so sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** I can apply more, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:24]** Eight plus seven is fifteen, plus four is nineteen.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:27]** You get nineteen hit points.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:36]** As Sarah Ray's light enters, hears, and enters me, he feels this relaxing warmth from the inside out.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:36]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:39]** Are you full up?

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:42]** Are you 100%

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:47]** Wait, how much... How good do I... Wait, how much is this now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** Are you still rolling?

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** 19 hit points.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** Okay, I'm fully... I'm topped up.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** Thank you.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:58]** Well, I should sleep for slots, but then I'll trade off with okay.

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** Cool.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:07]** Doc, I'm going to get a little bit of sleep, and then I'm going to work on the car if you need anything further with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** Yeah.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:14]** And because Colin's a doctor, any healing he does over your hit points heals stamina.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:14]** All right.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:39]** sexy oh well that's actually i wasn't even into my hit points now that i realized it i just added 19 stamina is that okay then in that case sure yeah that would have worked all right cool dope only because he's a doctor otherwise it would have been wasted yes yes it's good i knew there was a reason we had you yeah so colin is then going to heal himself


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:40 - 00:51:06]** and rolls like uh you're tired eight points tired like a good doctor you've you've healed other people first doctor okays helped and you're spending the last vestiges of what you have on yourself makes sense i'm actually gonna do that one more time because okay i'm 13 points down in hip head points yeah i'll roll i mean i i've got it i don't uh sure go ahead


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:11]** Because, I mean, I'm going to recharge my field dressing, too, after I rest.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:13]** Right.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** That gives you eight HP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:16]** Oh, nice.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** Nice.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** He can sense that you're tired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:21]** He's like, hey, let me just chill for a sec.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:25]** And that'll put me to full after a long rest.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** So I think I'm good.


## Speaker_0

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:28]** All right.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:35]** I'm going to grab some of this bits and bobs in this thing and get to cracking on the cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:39]** I'm used to those things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:43]** Colin, Rick, yours was the most damaged?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:48]** If I had to put a number on it, I'd say she was at about a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:52]** I'll get to work on that one first.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** Come on, Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:59]** I'm going to start to move the map towards nighttime because it's starting to get dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:59 - 00:51:59]** Yeah.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:02]** Colin was just... He's asleep before his head hits the pillow.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** Yeah.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:05]** He did a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** You deserve a good rest.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** You all did a lot.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:10]** Dr. K, here's how repair works.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:13]** It's a DC-16 engineering.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:17]** And you...

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:41]** in one hour's time you can restore a number of hit points that's like twice the vehicle's level to get into it so eight so you can restore eight hit points to the vehicle over one hour's time you have to expend 10 upbs per point of damage because it's like you're using some of that in combination with the tools to rebuild things to reconnect things

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:55]** so and there's a bonus if you exceed by a certain amount then you can have the time if you exceed by even more you can do more if you fail you get penalties i just rolled a natural 20.

**[00:52:56 - 00:53:26]** well done well done so what's your 14 engineering is my skill and i was 14 i would assume since i brought bernice that she would also be assisting okay which she does she can assist one person can assist so that's the first hour so in the first hour you actually you know exactly what's up you give that so 36 yeah so 36 so you in what would take an hour takes you 30 minutes

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:29]** And then on top of that, it halves the cost.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:39]** So if somebody wants to keep track, if you, for instance, just want to use the 500 UPBs that you have, you have healed eight points to the car.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** So you can add that back in if you guys want.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:46]** And you've only spent 40 credits or 40 UPBs.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** So that's the first hour.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:53]** How are we splitting this up to make super exciting podcasting?

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:58]** I just want to ask like you doing two hours and then Kelly will do two hours and go from there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** Is that how long a long rest is?

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Two hours?

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** I thought it was four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:04]** No, you need at least six hours.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Yeah, you need six.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:07]** So each person can take two hours out of the eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:08]** Yeah.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:11]** So I'm going to do another round of repairs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** Okay.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** Give me another engineering check.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** I like this.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:15]** I like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:16]** All right.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** It rolled 14 for a 28.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** And Bernice assists.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** She does.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** So 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:27]** That's another 40 UPBs spent.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:32]** And another 8 given to the vehicle.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:33]** So it's at 21 of 50.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** Pretty sweet.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** Pretty well done.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:42]** During this time, is it just Rick and Colin and Hears and y'all are just passed out, just snoozing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:42]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:43]** Yeah.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** All three of you, just out.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** OK.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:51]** So Dr. OK, that takes about, yeah, that takes actually about an hour of time.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** So that's the first hour.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:58]** So you could spend another hour if you want to, because you have succeeded so well twice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:03]** I did not roll as well, but I did meet the DC, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:32]** okay what's your 18 with bernice assisting let's see 20 yes she makes it okay okay that's that's still good that's still another eight that takes you the whole hour maybe the first hour you were quick you were on it then just the fatigue of the day is starting to set in because it's just you out there it's still hot but it's darker you're sitting there like you know maybe thinking to yourself it costs a little extra right

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:32]** Yeah.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:33]** Yeah.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:34]** It costs 80, 80.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:35]** Yeah.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:37]** Cause 10 per, per, per point.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:39]** So, I mean, that makes sense.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:41]** You realize that you can just take your time with it.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** So you just take your time.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** You just take the next hour.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:45]** So that 29 health now.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:45]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:47]** Okay.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:47]** And 29.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** Well done.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:50]** Now they're tooling for eight hours.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** No, two hours, two hours.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** Cool.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:53]** Two hours.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:58]** So that's two more hours off of your, uh, environmental protections.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:00]** Yep.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Guy's got to keep track of that.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:03]** So what do you do?

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:04]** You head back in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:07]** I'm going to head back.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** I might quickly...

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:13]** gander over at this garbage heap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:14]** Please.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:16]** Crunch, crunch.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:20]** I can hear the sound of your boots against the Varro soil.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:23]** Nothing useful that you can just pick up, really.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:32]** I mean, in the same way that you can just... I guess you could pick up a USB-C to USB-C cord, but you would need to haul things in, check all the diagnostics.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:37]** So if there's something that you like with a flashlight, you could try and find it, bring it in, take a look at it tomorrow.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** If there was something...

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:41]** But there's nothing sticking out to you.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:44]** You'd have to really go through and be like, all right, this was here.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:47]** Let me recreate this whole broadcast.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** No, I'm just going to go in.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:49]** Okay.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** You walk in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:51]** Hey.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** Walk over to...

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** Yeah.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:56]** Uh, do I tell, is here still resting or what's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** We'd wake him up.

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** It's his watch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** Please, please.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** No, not yet.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:01]** I need six hours.

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** Just give me six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** You can have six.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:05]** Can I, can I, it doesn't have to be continuous.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:06]** Okay.

**[00:57:06 - 00:57:07]** Yeah, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** Yeah.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:12]** Uh, I'm going to tell here's, I got the, uh, I got, uh,

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:15]** the poor driver's cars.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:21]** Colin and Rick's car is a little bit better than ours at the moment.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** It took me a little while.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:26]** I got tired towards the end, but yeah.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** What's left to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:30]** I mean, you could top up ours.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:30]** Okay.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:36]** He just gets up and would... Well, it's paused, I think, but he was going to move.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Oh, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** That's okay.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:40]** Okay.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:46]** As you do, Dr. K in here is giving me a perception check.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:46]** Motherfucker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:46]** Motherfucker.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** All right.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** Perception check.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:50]** Is the door open or is the door closed?

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** I would assume.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** I feel like you would maybe shut the door because it's.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:55]** Yeah.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:58]** I feel like you would shut it just because of the hot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:00]** I got a 20 on my perception.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:00]** Dirty.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:01]** Dirty 20.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** Okay.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:06]** Which I guess makes sense because Dr. K is not lethargic.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** He was just outside.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:09]** Yeah.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:11]** For the inevitable outcome.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** I'm just waking up.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:14]** I can't perceive shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:15]** You don't know.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:15]** Yeah.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:20]** For a brief second as you walked in, Dr. K, maybe a thought.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:24]** You know that feeling like when you like leave your keys in the car?

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:36]** Yeah, or like when you're like walking down the hallway and you're like in your house and you turn off the light and then you're about to walk into your lit room, but you look like into the darkness and you're like, I wonder if there's anything out there.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:40]** And you just, you pause for a second.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:46]** I told you I'm back.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** I told you I'm back.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:48]** Just super soon.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:57]** There is a sound at the door.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** There are three knocks.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:04]** Gentle, but firm.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:06]** And that's our game.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:10]** All right.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:13]** I just wanted to sleep.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:14]** That's all I wanted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** I know.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** I know you wanted to sleep.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:17]** I know you did.

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** I know you did, buddy.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** I know you did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** It's just Halloween on Burroughs.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:24]** Hey, what's up, everybody?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:24]** Trick or treat.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:25]** That's fine.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** Who's there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:31]** Find out next week.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:31]** GG.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:31]** Good game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Good game.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Good app.
