## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:11]** Hello friends.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:21]** Welcome to my channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:24]** Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:25]** This is your 12 a.m.

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:26]** to 2 a.m.

**[00:01:26 - 00:01:27]** slot.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:32]** I am your co-host DJ, John Swan, joined by my co-host DJs, Kevin, Vinny, Will, and Kelly.

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:35]** How are we doing tonight, folks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:36]** Greetings.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:37]** Hello.

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:39]** Greetings.

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:44]** You know, I'm very, very pleased that you moved to this time slot.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:47]** I think that this more fits a voice of your register.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** It's very relaxing.

**[00:01:49 - 00:02:01]** And, you know, our listeners before, they would write it and be like, hey, you know, I listen to you for ASMR, but my wife kind of finds it creepy, which is perfect because now that you're at 2 a.m.,

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:07]** Their wives are dead asleep and everyone else just gets to listen to your wonderful, soothing voice, including me.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:11]** I'm almost about to go to sleep every time I listen to you say anything.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:14]** I'm just so happy that we're here now in the middle of the night.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** Some might say that we are late night.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:19]** Others will say we are very early morning.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:23]** And for those listeners, good morning and get ready for your day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:25]** Get ready for your day on We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** A little ASMR, a little sexy, a little good vibes.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:29]** It's all fun.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:30]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:34]** See, there's a difference in this tone versus the tone of the 8 a.m.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:39]** show where we're like, Welcome to We'll Save the Podcast!

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** We'll save in the mornings.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:43]** And Kelly, where's your We'll Save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** Well, that's the thing.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:47]** You know, always, always.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** You know what I like about Will Save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:54]** Will Save is always on, always at the scene.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:56]** We're going live to John.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:58]** John, tell us what you're seeing out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** Well, actually, I see a lot of people here.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:04]** There is a lot of ASMR coming through.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:07]** The radio is ready now.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:07]** Oh, wow.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** It's so sexy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** It's so good.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:09]** I love Will Save.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** This is the best.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:12]** The traffic report from Will.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:12]** Exactly.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:13]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:20]** Okay, here on the chopper, we're seeing traffic down on... I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:24]** The 105 and the 405 are stopped like always.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** I didn't want to do that.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:30]** I was like, what's a highway in Starfinder?

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** The driftway?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:36]** The drift's packed with traffic from this airport.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** The drift is packed up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** Is there traffic in the drift?

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:42]** There probably is, and just no one talks about it.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:48]** That's part of the, like, 1D6 days or whatever that you just have to roll to figure out.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:49]** Stop and go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:50]** There's this big lane.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** Some dude's on his cell phone.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]** Yeah, there's always somebody on his cell phone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** Cut to the precog meteorologist.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:04]** I'm receiving a message from Drew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:10]** Kelly, we still haven't heard your welcome to Wool Save.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:16]** There were two different Wool Save intros in this one episode, and at neither point did you say Wool Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** Well, that's what I was saying.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** I was saying that I was doing the 2 a.m.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:20]** every single time.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:25]** It's opposite day for me always than it is for you.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** It's a different time of day.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:30]** So I'm always saying, like, I'm always doing it that soft way.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** You know what I mean?

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** You're always giving the ASMR.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** Yeah, that's nice.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:41]** Will, you said that you had something that you want to talk about from the April Fools.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:47]** Oh, I was, it was more aligned with April Fools, but yeah, I guess it's coming up.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:52]** I went to a wedding and as a gift, I was running a photo booth.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:53]** Awesome.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:57]** I gave him a real gift too, but like, you know, it was helping out.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** Yeah.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** And, um,

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:07]** If anyone's familiar with Magic Lantern for Canon, Vinny's nodding.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:16]** There's an Easter egg that I didn't know about in that software that's great.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:20]** On April Fool's, it plays an April Fool's joke on you.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:25]** And they were getting married on April Fool's because it's their favorite holiday.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** Good figure.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:30]** And holiday, whatever.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** I think it's a holiday.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:32]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:34]** Celebrated by many around the globe.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:34]** Yeah.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:38]** I mean, it was really just a matter of me having to set the date ahead.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:43]** But to do that when you're like trying to set up a photo booth.

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:46]** and do all the logistics of that.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:56]** And to have your camera just suddenly not work anymore after tinkering with it for several hours, I was like, holy crap.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:59]** And then I searched online frantically

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** Finally figured it out.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:09]** And that's why their wedding date photos are dated April 2nd, not 1st.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:22]** For those that may not be camera enthusiasts or in the know, Magic Lantern is a very widely accepted custom firmware for Canon cameras that unlocks a whole lot more potential than came before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:24]** We do a lot more features with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:36]** But because it's open source and kind of at the whim of whoever develops it, they can bake in fun Easter eggs like pretending to bork your camera on one day every year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:41]** Yeah, which it does to this day still as far as I know.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** Yeah.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** It was, it was a little terrifying.

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** Absolutely.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:54]** Um, cause you know, they were like, Oh, like when you offer to do it, I did it at another wedding and they saw it and they were like, Oh, well, could you do this for us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** I'm like, yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** And, um,

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:02]** Because they could have booked somebody else to run it.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:07]** I felt like if I don't do this, I'm going to ruin their day type pressure on top of it.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:09]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:12]** Moral of the story is don't get married on April Fool's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** Too much room for error.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** Also, it's free.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:17]** Don't expect it to work all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:25]** I think the actual moral of the story is custom firmware on mission-critical hardware is probably not a great move.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** Yeah, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** That could be one takeaway, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** That is a little weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:35]** Like, it kind of reminds me... But I had it programmed to do, like, the three bursts, you know?

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:41]** And then, like, you could do, like, clap or, like, motion to set it off.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:42]** So I didn't have to actually run it.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** Anyways.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** There's this... I'm using this laptop.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:50]** The laptop that I have is, like, a gaming laptop from...

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:54]** It's ROG Republic of Gamers laptop and it's cool.

**[00:07:54 - 00:08:02]** But then like on holidays, it will just like play like random lights or something when you like open it up and it looks like you've been infected by malware.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:10]** The first time this happened to me was like on Christmas Day and then like it just looked like I was taken over by like like reindeers or some shit.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** And I was like, Oh, I've been like,

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:13]** I've now been infected with malware.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:17]** Yeah, I looked it up, and people saw that as well for the first time.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** Yeah, that's the one thing about this piece.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:20]** It's not a bug.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:21]** It's a feature.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** So I don't know what's going to happen.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:22]** It's a feature.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** I don't know what's going to happen.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:24]** Oh, it's a feature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:29]** You know what else is actually a bug and a feature?

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:34]** The creature that you all were fighting last time.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** It's a feature creature?

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:36]** Feature creature?

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:41]** Also, is here's a bug and a feature?

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:42]** Literally, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** Oh, I thought you said future.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** Oh, is he a feature?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:45]** No, yeah.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** Is the situation a feature?

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** Here's the situation feature.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** Before we get there, though.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** Double feature.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** Double feature.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:59]** Speaking of the creature that you all were fighting, I did want to give a quick shout-out to our partner, Syrinscape.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:00]** Y'all are fantastic.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:01]** Shout-out to Syrinscape.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** Thank you.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:07]** I'll put that in like 3D positioning on TimeScape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:15]** Those 3D dragon sounds last episode were just like... Oh yeah, it was just like, oh god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** Yeah, that was creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** Speaking of that, I...

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:34]** Did come up with a, you know, noise, the way that this beak, scaly, feathered, elbow-armed creature that you all are fighting, you know, what it said or what it was trying to say.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:39]** And then I found, of course, I found a Sirenscape, like, sound set for it.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** Let's see if I can...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:47]** That's gross.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:49]** I didn't hear it.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** God dang it.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:52]** Did it just belch?

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** I ruined our sirenscape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** You ruined our sirenscape?

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:58]** This has been your sirenscape moment.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** No, it's okay.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** A real reptoid.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:28]** Like, you unmasked a real reptoid.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** That was clutch.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** That is, like, huge news here.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** Somebody take a picture.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:38]** Someone take a... Just grab a quick selfie.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:39]** Yeah.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** Should I actually selfie?

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** Should I selfie?

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** I'm going to selfie, but hopefully you won't see me.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** Oh, I forgot.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:47]** You might see spoilers.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** Actually, I'm not going to do it because you might see spoilers.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:49]** I won't tell you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:49 - 00:11:08]** we should point out though like if anybody has here's something weird from vinny it's because he's holding his microphone and i just realized that these are going to be on video so people are going to see you holding your microphone the entire episode yeah this is i'm i'm away from home right now i met my girlfriends in illinois and like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:12]** I packed up my gear and I'm trying to work on traveling lighter.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:14]** And I did, I did travel lighter.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:17]** I also, I forgot the clamp for my mic stand.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:23]** And so I'm just holding this like eight pound weight for the next hour.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** My left shoulder is already...

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:49]** well that sucks i've been in chicago for the first couple of days so like i was setting up my rig at 8 40 this evening to start at 9 central so it was one of those like there was nowhere open nearby that i could have done anything about it to fix no fries or anything i might have some zip ties somewhere that i could probably figure out but at this point i'm just i'm gonna work out my shoulders holding this microphone all night yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:51]** You can also work out your grip.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:53]** Just be your hand as the clamp for the thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:58]** I love that when he was joking about the selfie that he used the microphone as the camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:01]** Yeah, that was a good joke for audio.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:03]** That was nice.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** That's why I explained it.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:04]** I know.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Thanks, Kev.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:08]** See, this is why we all work together.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:10]** This is why we're all co-hosts of the 12 a.m.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** Hold on one sec.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:26]** Boom.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** Show players.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:31]** Angry fire eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:34]** It just looks like an owl.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** You know what it reminds me of?

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:39]** Did you guys ever watch the 90s remake of Lost in Space?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** In the 90s.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:45]** The big humanoid spider thing at the end of the movie.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** Well, that was way creepier than this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:50]** The one that, yeah, what's his name?

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:52]** Gary Oldman became a spider.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:53]** Exactly.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:53]** Gary Oldman.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** I forgot he did.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** Yeah.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:57]** He can play anything.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Such a range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:58]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** He really can.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:00]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** Shout out Gary Oldman.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** Shout out Gary Oldman.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** If you're free, we would love to have you, Gary.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** We'd love to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:09]** Do you know there's a series on Netflix now?

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:10]** Yeah.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** It's actually pretty good.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** I want to watch it.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:12]** Yeah.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** I haven't watched it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** It's a couple years old.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** For Lost in Space.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** Decent.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:59]** don't know if you know this but this creature was also in the fifth element it was and no one's shouting out it's accolades oh so because it's gross and ugly yeah it's it's one line was cut it was like hey watch out i think it's just misunderstood just just misunderstood it's really just an owl bear that's been shamed

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** Yeah, that's been shaved.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:04]** Although, I have to say the elbow out arms in the back are really creepy.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:04]** They're really creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** You can't tell.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:08]** Owl bears, you can't tell because they're so fur.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:08]** No, but they're bears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:09]** Their elbows are forward.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:13]** It looks like the feathers are dripping kind of.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** Yeah, it's weird.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:15]** Like they're melting into the scales.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** It's like toad skin.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:46]** yeah dude it's gross i mean dr okay you already established that this is some sort of like genetic aberration that's been designed to be uh like the shape and form that it is in this is maybe this is what the term moist looks like in my mind it's not that bad oh false vinny hates that word and that concept but this really isn't that bad oh oh it can't be that bad


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:48]** little owl frog.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** Cool.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** Let's f***ing kill it.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** Moist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** Alright.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** Thank you, Science Game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:01]** That was not me, but I did change the name of the creature to Moist in Foundry.


## Speaker_0

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:01]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:05]** Instead of the real name of the creature, which maybe you'll find out later.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:09]** So it was the Reptoid Stewards.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:12]** Again, Vinny, crazy that you all are looking at a real Reptoid.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:18]** And it said that it was going to... Oh, I did not mean to have this be round two.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** Let's go back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:22]** It took a standard action to operate its radio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:49]** yeah uh no so it was close to the end around one it took a move action to operate its radio that is the official rules kev thank you was the radio in her hand no it was her car so it's a move action to pull it out it was it was it was in her hand she has it she's on patrol kev it's a move actually vinnie's on her to sign up vinnie kevin's on his game today i'm so used i haven't heard him just like be like no rules like and lay down their law yeah i know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:53]** He's funny that shows will do that to you powdered his white wig and can't showed up ready to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:54]** That's right He did.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** Thank you.

**[00:16:55 - 00:17:09]** I am ready for the challenge Kev But no the rule is that she used a move action to say they're here and then she is going to run 30 feet forward Where is she going now?

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:16]** She just starts booking it moving forward 30 feet across Clarifying question

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:21]** God, we are one turn in, and there's already a clarifying question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** What's going on, Colin?

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:27]** Is the Reptile doing anything to hide their appearance at this point?

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:30]** I'm assuming they know that they've been revealed, that the jig is up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:31]** Good question.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** They have been revealed.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:37]** They are not trying to change at this moment.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:39]** They have said they're here, and they're trying to move in.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:41]** Cool.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** Good question, though.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:43]** Good question.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:43]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:45]** Okay, here's Fabrice.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** It's your turn.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** End of round one.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** Oh, geez.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Rick and Colin are across from you.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:54]** You and Dr. O'Kare are spread out on the right side of the map behind the boulders in cover.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** What do you do?

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:00]** Here's just trying to think what he did, who he attacked last time, and he's too lazy to check the notes.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** You didn't attack last time for this round one.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:03]** Oh, really?

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:04]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:08]** I already had in my mind exactly what I was going to do, and it's going to be a big surprise.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:11]** It's a big surprise.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:11]** Is it Magic Missile?

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:14]** Yeah, it's going to be that.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:14]** I knew it.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** I knew it.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:15]** Yeah.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:16]** I got it.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:20]** I'm trying to think who's more weakened at this point.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** I think it's neither.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** I don't think either of them are voiced.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** I thought Moist was attacked already.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:26]** Moist?

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** Yeah, so there we go.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** So exactly.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** All right.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:33]** So he's going to do his, he's going to take a full action to attack Moist.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:39]** So that's going to end up being nine plus three.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:44]** So 12 plus another three because of that half of his Technomancer level thing.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:46]** So that's going to end up being 15 points of damage.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** Exactly.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:48]** Crazy.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** And there's something else.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** I forget what it's called.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** What is this?

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** I forget the name.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** Hold on just a moment, John.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** Checking my... Yeah, okay.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:02]** So right now you should... You know the thing where basically it's like half-time Technomancer level, I can just automatically add those points, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:07]** You click on Magic Missile, it'll tell you... It should break down, but... No, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:08]** It doesn't.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** What does your hat say?

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** Not in the case of Hero Lab.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** What does your hat say, Will?

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:13]** Moist.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:15]** Ah, great.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:15]** Awesome.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:16]** Killer.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** Love that.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:19]** How did you do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** Is that a digital hat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:25]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** I have that.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:31]** This hat is what you're referring to.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** He does have the hat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:35]** All right, 15 points of damage to Moist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:41]** Did you own that hat prior to your knowledge of my sentiments on the term Moist?

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** Yes.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** Yes, he did.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:50]** Prior to his sentiments in general, or did you buy it after the first time you figured out that Vinny hated Moist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** No, I've always had this hat.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:51]** There it is.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:53]** Yeah, since time immemorial.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:55]** Since the word was created.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:58]** What do you want to do with the rest of your turn?

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:01]** That was a full action to get that extra missile.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:02]** I don't know.

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:05]** Here's can flip off Moist, I guess.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:05]** That's fine.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** That's a free action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** I think it's a move action, Kev.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Top of round two.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** Colin, Eden Brand, what are you doing?

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:16]** Moisties is on the other side of Rick.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:19]** The steward is starting to run you don't know where.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:23]** Closer to Bernice, Dr. K, and here's are still hidden behind the boulders.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:25]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:42]** from 15 feet away I'm going to take a quick measurement to see I'm going to run up to the steward and I'm going to make a melee attack to cast fatigue on that steward so hopefully they can't run away so fast


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:45]** And so is that a spell?

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** You're casting a spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** Yes, I'm casting a zero level spell.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:52]** Sometimes referred to as a cantrip, depending on your opinions on terminology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** Not in Starfinder books.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** Just saying.

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:55]** Okay.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** She gets an attack of opportunity against you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:03]** Let's see what that is.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** Yeah, what's up?

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:08]** To cast fatigue, I make a melee attack against a single target TAC.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:09]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:11]** Against the EAC?

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:13]** Casting this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** Very specifically.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:15]** That's what I needed to hear.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Yeah, that's what I needed to figure out.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:19]** So you run in against the EAC, against your EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:20]** Yep.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:29]** And that is a... So my melee would be... What's the modifier for melee attacks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:31]** It's a good question.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:33]** It's usually at level six, right?

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** You guys are level six.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:38]** So what is a mystic level six base attack bonus?

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:40]** First one to get there gets an extra plus two.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** Let's see.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** Joke, so you don't get an extra plus two.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:48]** At 6 level, it's plus 4.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:51]** I get an extra plus 2 to my EAC.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:51]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** So that's 2 plus my spellcasting modifier?

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:57]** Or 4 plus my spellcasting modifier?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:57]** Is that right?

**[00:21:58 - 00:21:59]** For what's the spell?

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:00]** It's Fatigued.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:25]** fatigue mystic spell we will look it up you had your key ability score yeah what's your key ability score wisdom okay so what's your key to your attack roll so uh four plus whatever your wisdom mod is awesome yeah four plus four eight so eight wow roll up and natural one 16 plus eight okay is uh eight times three is 24 so 24 against eac

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:41]** You're running, or she is running, and you almost just put your hand out in the smoothest way, and it just hits her shoulder, and you see her slow down as you've successfully fatigued her, foiling her run.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:43]** So what happens to her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:49]** She actually gets a DC 14 Fortitude safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** Fortitude.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** There's no shout for Fortitude Safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:55]** We don't like Fortitude Safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:56]** Fortitude Safe.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** Yeah, we hate Fortitude Safe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:00]** Fortitude Save the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:01]** Reflex Save?

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:03]** Eh, you know, it's fine.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** It's a what, Vinny?

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:05]** 14.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** DC what?

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:11]** Okay, good thing she rolled a 16.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:11]** 16.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:12]** Fortitude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** I believe Dr. O.K.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:18]** had already hit her, by the way, with a... Inhibitor.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:18]** Inhibitor.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:21]** So she has a minus one to attack rolls for a long time.

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:24]** And then now, so what happens when she succeeds the Fortitude save?

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** With the voice crack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:29]** I think the spell has no effect.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:30]** Oh, okay.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:37]** I find it interesting that you have to make a melee attack and they have to lose the D.C.,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** Yeah, it's a bit of a save or suck.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** Yeah.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:43]** But it's a lower spell, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** Yeah, it's a zero level spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:48]** Yeah, so that's how they can get by it.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:50]** So she slows down for a second.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:57]** I mean, she kind of stopped, but we're saying in mid-motion, your hand touches her and you see part of her slow down and then...

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:10]** Reptoid eyes just turn and look at you and smile and you see these fangs as a free action kept as a free action smile and you see these these this Angry row of teeth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:17]** Well having shot his shot and missed Colin is gonna come back over here Okay, do I get a oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:18]** Yeah for stepping out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:19]** Yep.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** Okay, I do.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:21]** I

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:36]** as she smiles does a 27 hit she has a melee weapon just clarifying as this hand hits you with her claw and

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:49]** and scratches you with these crazy long talons for only eight points of damage, though, leaving this nice laceration gash in the side of your armor.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** Woof.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:56]** Not getting out of there without a scratch as you smiled, or as a Reptoid smiled in front of your face.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** She knows what she's doing.

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:58]** Creepy.

**[00:24:59 - 00:24:59]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** Very great.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** Rick19, what do you want to do?

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:06]** Colin goes in toe-to-toe and comes back with a solid scratch.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** What are you doing, standing in front of Moisties?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:15]** Well, I've got my greataxe out, and I'm debating on whether or not I should do a full attack.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:17]** I have a plus.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** I have a plus eight.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:22]** So it breaks it down to a plus four.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** Might be worth doing.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** So I'm going to do it.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:24]** I'm going to do a full attack.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** He's doing it.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** Swing twice.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:27]** Swinging twice.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:30]** That's a seven plus four.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:31]** Eleven on the first one.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:34]** And a 22 on the second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:39]** First one just goes right over the moist head.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:42]** And the second one right into their shoulder.

**[00:25:43 - 00:26:04]** right into the shoulder it's a good hit for one point no it's uh one d12 plus eight a d12 get out of here no one rolls a d12 which is only a four on the die for a total of 12 points of damage 12 points of damage solid hit though this creature

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:11]** There's almost a human-like scream that comes out of the beaks.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:15]** The gnarly beak of Moist.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** It is that creature's turn.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** And it is not happy.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:22]** You're going to step away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:25]** I was looking over my character list because we're supposed to know our characters.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** I do have a class combat feat.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:36]** So now that I have made a melee attack, I get a plus two AC against anybody else around me.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** Wait, what?

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:42]** So, like, if the Reptoid were to attack me, I get a plus two to my AC.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** Ah, okay.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:48]** Because I'm in combat, like, close-hand combat with the Moisties.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:48]** I like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:49]** I like that.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:51]** Okay.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:51]** Moist?

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** This, yeah.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** You are right, Dr. Okay.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** It is Moist's turn.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:03]** And even though Rick's guard is up, Moist is going... Moist is pissed that...

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:11]** Rick 19 has damaged you so much, and it is going to immediately attack you.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** That is what they do.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:15]** That is a 30 to hit.

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:21]** And as a claw comes out and scratches you for 12 points of damage.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:33]** And this claw, I mean, you feel like the material of the claw is just, it's almost like it penetrates your armor like silk.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** Just like butter.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** Just...

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:39]** Just cuts through your skin so easily.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:42]** 12 points of damage from Moist.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:49]** And then it is going to take a 5-foot step closer to the Steward.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:54]** Seeing that Colin Edenbrand had the gall to come up.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:58]** It knows to protect the steward.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:58]** Dr.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** O.K., what are you doing on your turn?

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:02]** You're seeing this all play out in front of you 30 feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:02]** Yeah.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:04]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:09]** is going to instruct, first of all, Bernice to fall back and then maintain fire position.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:10]** Love it.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** On the Reptoid.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** Stay sharp.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** So where's she falling back to?

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** So she's going to fall back, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:21]** Wait, is Bernice still in stealth?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:24]** I... She could roll, I suppose.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:28]** You could try to roll stealthy for sure.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Go ahead.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:32]** Because then you could attack first and then walk away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:36]** 16 on the die for a 22 stealth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** For a 22 stealth.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:43]** It seems like... Well, I mean...

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:46]** If you want to try and attack... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:49]** If you want to try and attack, I have rolled a perception for both of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:56]** I would have to do a full action for... Like, I would have to actually take over for Bernice, and I still want to do an action.

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:56]** Sure.

**[00:28:57 - 00:29:02]** So I'm just going to instruct her to fall back 30 feet.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** Just here.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:07]** So she's kind of, like, out of the range.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:12]** But she can still do some fire support, and then...

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:22]** I'm going to come up just outside of the rocks area, and I'm going to fire at the steward.

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** You're going to fire at the steward.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:28]** Bernice moves back, just scrambles the suitcase, scrambles.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:33]** With the decimator, and I'm going to try to hit her with the pharmacological inhibitor.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:35]** Okay, pharmacological inhibitor away.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:42]** And that is a 17 on the die for 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:45]** Does that weapon use a charge?

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:48]** Or is it your costa jet that uses it?

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:48]** It's the costa jet.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:49]** Yeah.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** Does the costa jet use a charge?

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** I believe so.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:53]** I think so, too.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:56]** I need you to give me a reflex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:59]** Is there a range on this effect?

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Yes, there is.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** I got a 19 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** I'm sure I passed.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** You're good to go, Dr. Okay.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** You're good to go.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** It was 24.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** 24 hits the Reptoid.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:11]** Stuart!

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:13]** That was 24 on the reflex save.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** 19 die.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:15]** You're fine with a 24.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** You're good, you're good, you're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:17]** It was...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** Yeah.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** Yeah.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** 1d8.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:20]** Give me a d8.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:24]** What was the roll against the steward?

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:24]** Yeah.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** Wait, no, what was that attack roll?

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** Sorry, I missed that.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** Oh, that was, I had a 17.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:30]** I think.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** 17.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:31]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** Cool.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** Yeah.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** Plus 6.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:34]** Plus 6.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:35]** 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:35]** Yeah.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:35]** 23.

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:36]** Duh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:36]** Yes.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** 23.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:42]** And I just rolled an eight for 13 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:47]** Full max damage possible on this creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:53]** And give me a fortitude save.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** Again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:58]** That is a 23 on the fortitude save.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** She's a hardy one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** So you are encumbered.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Encumbered.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** Nice.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:07]** Nice.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** Okay.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:08]** All right.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** All right.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** But not entangled.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** Encumbered but not entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:16]** Her condition, her body slows down.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:22]** You see like the fatigue that Colin almost wanted to have come over her.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:30]** as her speed is reduced to 10 feet wow that's a wow that sucks encumbered sucks all right well done dr okay

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** They are both hurting.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:34]** They're both hurting.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:42]** Dr. K moved up, successfully got through whatever field is in effect, and was able to encumber the steward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:47]** Can I do like a, is there a check to investigate that at all?

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:48]** On my turn?

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:49]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** You want to do a life science check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:55]** Or I'd say an engineering check, because now you've been, you've felt the effect.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** Whichever one you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:56]** Okay.

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:00]** I actually got a 30 on my engineering check.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:00]** 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:03]** Bernice also was subject to this effect.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** Then you were.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** Which is why she also moved away.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** Exactly.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:16]** And you're confident that this is some sort of electromagnetic field that disrupts technological devices and constructs.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:26]** So comm units, if you have a device with a charge that's within the 30 foot radius area, then you have to succeed at a reflex save.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:28]** If you're a technological construct, not

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:31]** not you, Rick, then you actually would be staggered.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** And you can't do any energy.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** Sorry?

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:36]** I am a constructive character.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:38]** You are constructive, but you're not a technological construct.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** I did check.

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** I could be wrong, but I think you're... So is Bernie a technical construct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:46]** Is Britney's a technological construct?

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:52]** I don't know what's the definition of technological construct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** Let's not worry about it right now.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** You are also outside of the range.

**[00:32:54 - 00:33:00]** I will put on this range so you all know what is happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:02]** Who is making this range a thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:06]** Is it just on the steward or is it on moist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:08]** No, it's on moist.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** Moist?

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** It seems like it's part of moist abilities here.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Moist.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:12]** Moist.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:15]** Okay, Dr. K, do you want to do anything else with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** That's all I can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Smart turn.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** Smart turn.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:19]** Okay.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:28]** The Reptoid Steward having successfully just feeling like they... Even though Colin unmasked them, they gave you a little jab, Colin.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** They put you in your place a little bit.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** They are confident.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:36]** And they then start to run to the west.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:39]** They are encumbered, so they move slower.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:44]** And they're going to move to the west again.

**[00:33:44 - 00:34:06]** and south closer towards the entrance and then as they move and as they move one of their hands pulls out a gun they have a base stack bonus plus one kiff and they're gonna fire at colin pretty much everything has a base tech bonus plus one kiff

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** At this point.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:08]** Thanks, John.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:10]** I wasn't questioning it.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:16]** Well, just in case, that's a 29 against EAC Collin.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:16]** Jeez.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:25]** Yeah, that's 10 points of damage to you as this... You feel the energy almost try and push you back.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:28]** You don't move five feet, but you feel like it just...

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:33]** Like, you are surprised by the force of this gun hitting you.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** Here's Fabricius.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:36]** End of round two.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** What are you looking at doing?

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:41]** You are still out beyond in the rocks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:43]** Is it a magic missile?

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:45]** Yeah, I'm doing some very Thaddeus tactics here.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** Yeah, because of the range.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:47]** Run away?

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:51]** I promised I was... Hey, shut up.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:56]** Well, I would, but the edge of the map, I'm literally at the edge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** I can't run anymore!

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:00]** I'm stuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:08]** So, I promised I wouldn't just use magic missile all the time with this new ability, but I'm going to have to for this battle.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** Sorry.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** So he's going to do that again.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:11]** Yeah.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:13]** This is the only safe way of doing this right now.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:13]** Yeah.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:22]** So basically, 13 total against our good pal Moist.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:24]** Against Moist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:28]** Again, just trying to make it in the acting business.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:28]** Okay.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:30]** Was in Fifth Element a long time ago.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Had their line cut.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:34]** It's Gary Oldman?

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:36]** It's not Gary Oldman.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:41]** Unless there's Reptoy Gary Oldman in which Gary Oldman plays everybody.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:41]** He can do anything.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:45]** You unmask the moist and it's Gary Oldman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:48]** The range of Gary Oldman again.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Again.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** You unmask it.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:53]** It's the inspector from the Batman movies.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** I can't remember what his name is.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** It's like the villain from that.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:58]** Whatever.

**[00:35:58 - 00:35:59]** He does too many good things.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:00]** I got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:04]** Moist looks like they are in rough shape.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:05]** Rough shape.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:10]** Dr. K, I didn't ask you, by the way, how long is the Reptile Steward encumbered?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:17]** The rest of their life?

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:22]** It's not going to have permanent emotional damage to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:24]** I believe it's seven rounds.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:29]** I think so, too, because it was earlier for the other inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:30]** Cool.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** We will go with that.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:34]** I'm checking, though, because it doesn't say on my hero lab anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:34]** Okay.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** No worries.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** Appreciate you.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:38]** Let's keep going while you check.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:40]** They'll definitely be in cover for the next round at least.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** It's top of round three.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:47]** Colin, you've been hit and you've been hit twice by this Reptoid.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:50]** Do you get back in the ring or not?

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** Oh, a thousand percent.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** Okay, cool.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** For sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:59]** Colin definitely doesn't appreciate being slashed and shot by this imposter steward.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:02]** This goes against everything he stands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** Strong words.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Impostor.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Impostor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** Stoosers.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:13]** I think Colin is going to... You'll see him shaping a little ball of energy and says...

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:16]** Your worst nightmare delivered right to you.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:22]** And shunts his hand to cast Mind Thrust at the Reptoid Steward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** Oh, wow.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** You could not.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** That'd be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:29]** Who needs to make a DC 16 will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:32]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:35]** John responded to that.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:35]** I did it.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:35]** I see.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** I did it.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:36]** I did.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:37]** We'll see.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:37]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** Will, I'm going to roll the dice that you got me.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:43]** I hope you didn't load them to negative one.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** It's the one you got me for my birthday a while ago.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** It's like the fire dragon die.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:47]** Yeah.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** I hope it fails.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** Thank you.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** Oh, okay.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:52]** It looked like a one, but it was a seven.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:57]** So, yeah.

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:59]** Was it DC what, Colin?

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** 16.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:00]** Okay.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:01]** Fails.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:02]** Fails!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Whoa, indeed.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:06]** Whoa, indeed.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:10]** So then, you take seven psychic damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:18]** Seven psychic damage as... As their mind gets overloaded with, you know, whatever their worst fears are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:21]** Seven sounds low for a Mind Thrust.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** What level is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:22]** Level one.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** First level.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** 2d10.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** I rolled a two and a five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:26]** Okay.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:28]** Okay.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** You know what her worst fear is?

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:32]** Not being lying alone.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:36]** Yeah, not not being liked by other people and this confirms it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:50]** Yep She feels the heat, you know And she knows that she might don't like you she sees like flashbacks from school where she wasn't exactly Because they could all do Gary Oldman impressions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:53]** She could not she could not

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** Rough.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** Rough time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:59]** She couldn't shapeshift into Gary Oldman.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:00]** She couldn't.

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:31]** she was the one reptoid at the Gary Oldman party that looked like Willem Dafoe that's it killer killer Willem Dafoe not good Gary Oldman they were having a huge Harry Potter party and everybody was showing up as Harry Potter characters and she was supposed to be and she couldn't do it it's rough 7 points of damage


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Also not holding up too well.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:34]** What else you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** You want to run away in fear?

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** I'm not going to run away in fear.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:47]** Colin's actually going to move to put himself between him and her or between her and her presumed destination.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:52]** I would like to remind the class that he does have his survival knife drawn and in his hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:55]** Did you get an AOO on the way?

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:59]** Or did she put away her... Oh, she has claws.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Yeah, she has claws.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:04]** So she gets another AOO on you if you're going to step right in front of her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:05]** Or do you go back and around?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:10]** I sure will say he went back and around.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:13]** You actually back-trot and then sidestep and you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Are you just like gritty?

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Yeah.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** Like over to her?

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:18]** Of course.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:18]** Okay.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:19]** I like it.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** It's six seconds.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** I'm actually at a pretty good gritty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:26]** I need a video of you doing this.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:26]** So it's 10.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** You got to do it.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:33]** So later after the ep, it's 10 feet left, 10 feet down, five feet back right.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:35]** I need a video of you doing that on the Discord.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:48]** Done from above we should make it on the ground and then we can make it a sticker Apparently we need to capture a video of me doing the gritty I am down in in this same within six seconds Please don't break your ankles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:52]** All right done cool Rick 19 All right.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** I rolled exactly the same.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** 12 points of damage.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:26]** 12 points of damage on this creature.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:34]** And it falls to the ground dead.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:35]** Oh, no.

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** You have killed.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** Moist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:39]** Does that mean the field's gone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:41]** That means that the field is gone.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** I was just trying to find where the dead.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:44]** There's the dead condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:44 - 00:42:09]** They have passed into this next life to play their biggest role yet as an angel He was the cool one moist it's kind of a cute The oh my god, yeah, the Reptile Steward was always supportive dreams


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** You want to do anything else, Rick19?

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:16]** No, that's my whole turn.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:17]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** Okay.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:18]** All right.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** Oh, cause of the full attack.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:19]** Thank you.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:20]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** What do you do?

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** The field is gone.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:28]** One, this horrid creature aberration is dead on the Vero surface.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:55]** uh dr okay is going now question if i want to switch to a melee weapon i have to drop my weapon if i want to move and attack or yeah or if if one is one-handed and you're pulling out another one-hand weapon you could no it's a two-handed weapon okay yeah it's fine all right so you would but just like you know metagame is that you would drop it as long as you're not going to reuse it in this combat


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** Then you would just go pick it up later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** Yeah.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** That's kind of how it's played.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** I hope this works.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:04]** I'm going to run with my weapon, drop it at my feet.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:05]** Uh-huh, uh-huh.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Okay, hold on.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:07]** I've got to move.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:07]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:11]** I'm going to move up to the reptoid.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** I'm going to be 10 feet away.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:13]** Okay.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:17]** I'm going to pull out my...

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:36]** new contraption my apprehension class capture pole oh okay i'm going to attempt to i guess i attack and grapple i'm i gotta yeah actually i should read up on how to do this yeah the um i imagine it's just like this really really fancy dog catcher's pole

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Yeah.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** Sort of.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** That's kind of what I imagine.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** But it has an injection property, which is nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:46]** Yeah, so basically you make an attack.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:50]** If you are successful with the attack, then you automatically... Grapple?

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** No, you automatically inject whatever's in there.

**[00:43:54 - 00:44:01]** Then, if you want to grapple, you can use it to perform a grapple combat maneuver without having your hands free.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:04]** You get a plus two bonus to that grapple attack roll.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:06]** And if you roll a natural 20... Let's do it.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:10]** then you automatically apply whatever other critical effect.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:11]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:14]** But to grapple is still... You have to hit KAC plus C. Right.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:19]** So do they lose the attack if they don't hit the grapple?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Their KAC or my KAC?

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** Their KAC plus C. Okay.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:25]** Well...

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** All right.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:28]** Then hold on one second.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:37]** Let me just do some... If I hit with a basic inhibitor, that reduces their AC by two, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** You've already hit them with a basic inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:40]** Yeah.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** They don't stack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:42]** Wait, what?

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Do they stack?

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:46]** I thought that the basic inhibitor was a minus one to their attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:48]** No, that was the minor inhibitor.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** That was the minor inhibitor.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:52]** The basic inhibitor is...

**[00:44:52 - 00:45:02]** I can choose between target takes a minus two penalty to AC, DR reduction by five, or target resistance to an energy by five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:04]** You didn't hit them with that yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:06]** All right, so I'm going to walk up.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:10]** I'm going to roll for the attack on my apprehension.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:14]** Okay, so you're rolling to attack and grab them and inject them with that minor inhibitor.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** Yes.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** Or with the basic inhibitor.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:16]** Cool.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:17]** Love it.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:17]** Walk up.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** They're not even looking.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:22]** I can see the cam moving as Dr.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** O.K.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** 's coming up and see the weapon in your hand about to slam down.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** And what do you roll?

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:29]** It's a 19.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** It's a 19 against KAC?

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:31]** Yeah.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:38]** That's a hit on the steward as it wraps around their neck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:41]** Do I roll damage and then do you try to do the grapple?

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:44]** No, your grapple would have to be your next standard action.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** So next turn.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** Yeah.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** Oh, okay.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Yep.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:49]** So they can move away then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Right now they are right there.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:58]** I don't think that they're grappled because you haven't successfully grappled them, but you did hit them with this and inject.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:59]** I thought I, okay.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:00]** Do you want to redo that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:02]** No, no, no.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** I'll roll for damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:05]** You could just do a grapple check instead of the damage.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** You could just try and grapple them.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** No, I'm going to kill this bitch.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:39]** always been supportive of moist and yet the hate still comes in uh that is 16 points of damage 16 points of damage she is looking at a reduction of her ac by two and ac down by two okay reduction by two yeah go ahead and now bernice is gonna open fire oh i forgot about that so bernice moved last time okay cool got it yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** Let's kill this bitch.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:44]** That is a 17.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:44]** Against?

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:45]** Ye.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** Against ye?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** A say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:52]** I think that's what a cylindrical lens pistol would be, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Yep.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:53]** Okay.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** That's probably fire.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** Laser.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:58]** And let me roll again.

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** Roll again.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** Tell me what you get.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** Tell me what you get.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:04]** Tell me what you get.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:05]** Tell me what you get.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** Max damage?

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:07]** One.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:08]** Eight.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:12]** Eight points of damage with the pistol.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:29]** Colin, I imagine that you gritty, you're running over, and as you start to come up, she is running that way, and then just this apparatus comes around her neck, and you see her get stabbed with the basic inhibitor, and then...

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:49]** shot and she drops to her knees and falls to face forward the first Reptile dad that you've seen and her body does not move you have killed The Reptile you killed the only Reptile you've ever known Grave words


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:51 - 00:48:10]** right is is there room for me to cast stabilize as she falls no she's dead yeah really yeah dude like monsters don't get that whole that whole thing yeah okay well i'm still gonna cast great words


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:13]** That's very prejudiced.

**[00:48:14 - 00:48:15]** No, I mean, they don't by the rules.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:16]** That's an intelligent monster.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:19]** Yeah, no, that's cool.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:19]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** All right, cool.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:25]** Well, maybe... Are you just saying that I'm a Reptoid?

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:27]** Are you insulting all Reptoids now?

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** I'm not.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:29]** They don't get cool rules.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:30]** They don't read rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** So she's face first in the ground.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:36]** You all still remember... I'm going to end the combat here.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** Dr. Ace is going to pick up his decimator.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** You pick up your decimator.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:41]** What's the mood?

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** What do you guys talk about?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** What do you say?

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** This is a fine gun.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** Before anything happens, I think Colin searches the body.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** On the body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:56]** Here's adds moist to his Pokedex.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:57]** Sorry to interrupt.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** He's just going to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:00]** He's in there now.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:06]** Moisties is a bird reptile type Pokemon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:10]** Yeah, maybe Dr. K wants to get a DNA sample of Moist.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Do a quick analyzer.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** Yeah, will do.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:16]** Colin, you go over... And of the reptoid.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:17]** What, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Why would he not take it of the reptoid, too?

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:20]** Sure.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:23]** A reptoid is just as weird as a reptoid creature.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:23]** Sure.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:24]** That's fine, too.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** That's true.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:28]** Listen, their bodies... I checked their donor card.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** It says they donated to science.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:33]** They do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:33]** It's fine.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** They do.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:34]** They do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:41]** Colin, you go up and you rummage through the reptoid's pocket.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:44]** And as you do, you feel the skin, maybe.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:46]** You have to turn her over.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:48]** The skin...

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:53]** I don't know how to say it feels both smooth and sharp at the same time.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:55]** It's a little bit like a, like a shark.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:56]** Yeah.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:59]** But literally at the same time, like no matter what direction that you do it.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:02]** And as you like move it, it's like a cappy bar.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:10]** Maybe your hand grabs on and you can see that as you, as, as you grab the skin, it like expresses different pigments.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:13]** There are different colors that come out.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** There's like a different texture.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:18]** Some of your hand feels hot and it feels cold in one finger and hot in the other finger.


## Speaker_0

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:49]** you start going dead body is doing this i mean she just died and in general i'm just talking about the physiology i'm giving some color kev i didn't know if that was i didn't know if this is like a natural like their bodies just continuously do this until they're they're like hit rigor mortis or if like that's a conscious thing that they can shift around i mean dude if we can zombie reptoids zombie what if she breaks back up her eye pops open shoot it double tap


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:51]** If we could do shape shifting or something.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:55]** If we could scrape those properties and use it in some way, that'd be so cool.

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:57]** I'm going to add this one to my Pokedex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:01]** You guys sound like Hannibal Lecter wanting to wear this reptile skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:05]** That's a little intense.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** Colin, you find a pusher decoupler.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** That was the gun that hit you.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:15]** It has a critical of corrode and demoralize.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** Usually it just has demoralize.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:24]** You also find a hook sword, which, you know, help with tripping.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:25]** Cool.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:27]** Tripping enemies if you want to use that combat maneuver.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:36]** And to find basic glitch into temp weave and a personal comm unit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** Well, we're taking that comm unit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** For sure.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** Okay.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:40]** So you take the comm unit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** Pack that thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:50]** Dr. O'K, you go and grab some DNA samples of the steward and of Moist.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:51]** Yes.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** Okay.

**[00:51:53 - 00:52:04]** When you get the samples of moist, you see that it's a rarely used entry that maybe you've seen before.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:08]** This thing is called a wet zelt.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:19]** And your quick study showed that this scaly skin, glowing eye, bulbous head with melty feathers, and a

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:24]** gnarly beak and elbowed out humanoid arms.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:33]** This was absolutely once a normal reptoid humanoid reptoid.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:47]** And based on the way that the body changed with the introduction of this wet cell virus, DNA, whatever it is, it was absolutely painful.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** So you start thinking anthropologically, you think

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:55]** This was done to reptoids who did something wrong.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** This was a punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** Moist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:59 - 00:52:59]** Exactly.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** They were turned moist.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** Poor moist.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:04]** R.I.P.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:05]** Okay.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** What else did you all want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:15]** So mechanically, have we harvested that virus in a way that we could deliver it to other reptoids?

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:15]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** It's just the DNA of the creature.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Got it.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:21]** That's horrible, by the way.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** That's a disgusting thing.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:25]** Is that how gray boundaries are made or something?

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:26]** I wonder.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:29]** Maybe you should talk to a conspiracy theorist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** I think that's horrible.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:33]** I thought what we got was that gray bounders are more like a pet.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** Like it's an animal.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** Yeah, but so is this boy.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:45]** Well, this is a genetic transformation where I think gray bounders are naturally occurring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:48]** I think reptoids operate on a caste system.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:52]** And so they just make certain people do terrible things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:55]** You should, again, talk to a conspiracy theorist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** I'm going to write a book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:02]** There are probably some fringe websites and PDFs out there that you can download when you have some free time.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:05]** Also, note.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** Another late night show.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:10]** The one thing that didn't really come up because it wasn't necessary.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:17]** The what's out besides the electromagnetic field has these intense claws that ignore hardness.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:40]** up to the cr of the wet salt so if y'all were in vehicles or behind a door it absolutely can like it is known to hunt you know through victims that yeah like it can cut through a lot of doors and material because it's going to ignore the harness take this dude's arms and just um like cut through this uh

**[00:54:40 - 00:55:04]** and use them as like do you want to like take out the claws like a raptor claw and try and use it as a weapon sure i can help you make a weapon i wanna can i like claw through the sidewall of the space interesting you could try you could try it will it might take a while

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** It's concrete.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:07]** For John to look up the hardness of concrete.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** It's like reinforced concrete.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:14]** I mean, how thick could it be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:16]** A secret base on Veros?

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:17]** Good question.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:19]** Good question.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** Let's say you take the class.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** What do you all want to do now?

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** You're like the moment still there.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:28]** They have said they're here and you're standing outside.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:29]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:32]** Do we, do we hear any chatter on that comms device?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:35]** You don't hear any chatter on that comms device.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:38]** Okay.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** My signal jammer is active again.

**[00:55:43 - 00:56:01]** So knowing that it was, you know, just whatever nullified, you see Rick actually pick up, he's got like it attached to his gear and he kind of just pulls the signal jammer off and it just kind of melts into his hands.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:21]** uh as he disperses it since the signal jammer is not doing it didn't you know it has been negated for just a second i think it's enough for him to throw the jammer away altogether he disperses that so now try again if is there anything coming off of us nothing coming in off the comms


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** Okay.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:26]** But the signal is no longer jammed.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** What are you saying?

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:29]** There's no more jamming on the signal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:31]** Well, it wasn't jammed.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:36]** And for the time that I was in the range of the creature, it was no longer jammed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:38]** Nobody.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:39]** Nevermind.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** Space boss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:44]** I'm sorry.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** It's been a while.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** It's been entirely too long.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:48]** Raspberry jam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:48]** So,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:58]** Should we walk around the perimeter and prepare for them to exit and possibly do another ambush?

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:02]** If we approach this door, they have the advantage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:13]** Yeah, is there, like, well, I mean, we could test the theory, too, that, like, maybe this Reptoid has, well, if they called it in, they probably went over to control it anyway.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:18]** But I was wondering if, like, this Reptoid had anything on them that would disable it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** Do you want to just hack the comms unit?

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:21]** Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:26]** Does this Reptoid have any identification on them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:26]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:27]** Okay.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:31]** I think the best course might be to hack this comm unit.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:42]** We could probably sell plausibly that the Reptoid might be changed into one of us, potentially, to try to infiltrate the group.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** Who's got the best bluff check?

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** What does Dr. K say to that?

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** I don't know.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:47]** Hmm.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:53]** Who's the best at disguising themselves as one of us as a Reptoid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:57]** Not I. Um...

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:01]** I don't think I can help with that.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:05]** I have many ways to be invisible and have invisible things do things for me.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** That's my limit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:08]** My bluff is five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** My bluff is plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:17]** Maybe we should go ahead and hack the comm unit first before we decide on this course of action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** That sounds like a plan.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** At least better than clawing through concrete.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** Who's hacking?

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** Is it a computers or engineering check?

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** It's a computers check.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:27]** Rick can assist.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** I have a plus 15.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:31]** But what's Dr.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** O.K.'s?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** I have 12 computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** Rick doesn't assist.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:35]** All right.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** I have the highest.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** Let me roll that.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:40]** So Bernice and I will assist.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:43]** 32 plus 6 then.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** Plus 4, I should say.

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:45]** 36.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** Bernice and Dr. O.K.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:47]** assisted.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:50]** Easy peasy.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:54]** You are inside the comm unit.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** It's like a dumb phone.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** It's pretty basic.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:58]** There's a two-way comm.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:04]** There seems to be some sort of other app that's set behind a firewall.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** And there's also photos.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:09]** You can take photos.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:10]** You look through the photos.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:13]** There's some selfies with her and Moist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:17]** Should we take a selfie?

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** With the dead body?

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** Yeah, let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:22]** Hey, can I do grave words?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:26]** Yeah, I'm not stopping you if you want to do grave words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** Yeah.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:32]** I cast grave words on our poor, unfortunate steward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:40]** While that's happening, maybe here's you want to try and hack the... Maybe she yells out her password.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:43]** Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:47]** She says, delete all my browsing history.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** Get rid of all my browsing history.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:51]** Here's rolled a 30 on that hack.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:54]** Okay, 30 on the hack.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** Does he need assistance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:58]** Well, Dr. K is occupied.

**[00:59:58 - 00:59:59]** I don't know if he can help.

**[00:59:59 - 00:59:59]** Bernice assists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:01]** Bernice, of course.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:01]** Bernice.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:02]** Bernice assists.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:05]** Well, she's got to roll for it, but as long as it's above four, she's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** Go ahead and roll, Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:08]** No, she... Okay, cool.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** I just did.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:09]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** Rolled a 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:13]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:15]** You cast grave words.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:34]** And when her mouth opens and the voice that comes out is like 10 voices at once, all these different sounds, all these, there's like male voice, female voice, non-binary, like all these different species, they all come out at once.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** And they say,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:43]** Try typing that into the computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:46]** Don't let them get to the computer core.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:49]** That's how it sounds like to me.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:52]** You do a... You are able to crack the app.

**[01:00:52 - 01:01:04]** And there's a panic button here that you would think, oh, this is tied to the gun behind the gun port in front of the entrance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:07]** So I can disable the gun?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:07]** Excuse me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:19]** Here's would like to do that or does it free access to move action, but you push it and there's a nice satisfying click and then it's gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:25]** That's a nice, nice click gun down.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:29]** Do I need to, do I need to do something to get these doors open or are they just going to open?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:33]** Like, uh, I mean, the door is, the door is still locked.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:34]** Maybe.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:37]** Or maybe you have to still try and get in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** Maybe it's unlocked.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:41]** Just in case cutting through however many feet of concrete doesn't work.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:44]** Well, he doesn't want to open it.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:45]** He wants to find out if it's locked.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** Can you do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:50]** Is that like... How else do you find out that a door is locked?

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:53]** Truthfully, like... Colin walks up to the door and tries it.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:54]** Thank you, Colin.

**[01:01:54 - 01:02:01]** So while he is philosophically discussing what a locked door is, Colin just tries it and it is locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:05]** It's both locked and unlocked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:10]** The door is locked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:13]** Thank you for trying that.

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:15]** You're welcome.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:22]** Is there a standalone camera that's not attached to the gun in this case?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** Yes, there is a camera.

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:25]** It is on currently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:25]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:27]** I'd like to disable that, please.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** Give me an engineering check, Paul.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:30]** Rick puts his middle finger up towards it.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:34]** I like the CCTV shot of you all walking up and Rick flicking it off.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:38]** First, if here's being like, what, do I lock it?

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:40]** And then Colin's like, let me just try it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:44]** This is a very poorly designed base, okay, if that's possible.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:45]** Don't, don't, don't, don't.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:48]** So, like, it's a 28 engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:49]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:52]** You're able to disable the camera.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]** Actually, the camera was locked, so you could.

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:56]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:58]** The camera you disabled.

**[01:02:58 - 01:02:59]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:03]** I'm sorry, buddy.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:03]** It's fine.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:04]** All right.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** Are there any others?

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:08]** Are there any other security measures that need to be dealt with?

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:11]** Oh, it's if it's locked, you where can you unlock it?

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:13]** Can you electronically unlock rickrolls?

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:14]** It's trying to be done from the inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:20]** Is it like a physical rickrolls of what rickrolls of 22 is able to unlock the door.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:46]** rick rick's like i got this and just puts his finger in and kind of just jams the just a little shoulder yeah twist the doorknob just it's it's just like a closet door like he just uses his fingernail to unlock it yeah it's an it's an it's actually a wood door yeah yeah it's still locked on geez calm down buddy let me unlock it's a wood screen door geez


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:49]** Alright, I'm gonna unlock the door, Rick.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:51]** Alright, well.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** Okay.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:54]** And the door is unlocked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:58]** Are we gonna stack up on the door before we open it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:59]** Yeah, Rick's got his gun up.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** Let's not stack up.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:02]** He puts his gun forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:05]** Here's your all the way over there.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:06]** You gonna come join us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** Pop the handle.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** Here's Gritty's over.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:12]** And then he's down.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:14]** He gives a wink to Colin.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:14]** You see that?

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** I learned that from you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:19]** We should just run in and grab the computer core.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:19]** Moving.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** And Rick pushes the door open.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:25]** Okay, the door is open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:27]** The door is open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:28]** I'm not going to stack up.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:29]** That's not a good thing to do.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:30]** You go in first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:36]** It's called stacking up when you align yourself for how you're going to enter the door.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:38]** It's so dumb that the military does it.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:41]** That's what I was about to say.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:42]** That's literally how you enter homes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:44]** I lived on a submarine.

**[01:04:44 - 01:04:45]** for three years.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:46]** Did you stack up in a submarine?

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:47]** Because there's no room there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:54]** I went through firearms training where we stacked up in order to appropriately... We did a role initiative before this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:54 - 01:05:01]** I understand, Tears, that you are salty about Colin and your content stealing your thunder of unlocking the door.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:02]** And I'm sorry.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:04]** but no, it's fine.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:05]** What do you want to do?

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:05]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:06]** All right.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** He's all right.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:09]** The doors, the doors open.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** The doors open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:10]** He's leaning.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:12]** Rick 19.

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:14]** When you open the door, here's his leaning.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:22]** When you open the door, it's like opening a door in the Southern summer in August.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:27]** A just whatever heat you're feeling outside on Barrows.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:33]** You feel it push over your skin.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:39]** The entire inside of this hallway that you see in front of you is hot.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:46]** And when you're breathing, there's almost a little bit of a quick condensation that comes up and then comes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:49]** I am so moist right now.

**[01:05:49 - 01:05:51]** The moisture, it's just all over me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:58]** You're saying it's hotter inside than it is outside on a lava planet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:01]** No, I'm just saying it's very, very, very moist in here.

**[01:06:01 - 01:06:02]** All the moisture in there.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:04]** It's not as moist as it is outside.

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:08]** It just waves over in front of you.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:09]** God damn lizards.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:12]** Rick19 takes a step in.

**[01:06:12 - 01:06:17]** And as you do, you see that the air, it even tastes a little hot.

**[01:06:18 - 01:06:21]** The floor, it seems a little wet.

**[01:06:21 - 01:06:22]** There's just condensation.

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:24]** Slick with humidity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:27]** Is this just a sauna?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:28]** You see off to your left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:29]** This whole facility?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:31]** Good question, Dr. K. Sorry, I didn't mean to talk over you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:32]** It could be that.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:33]** Wait, sorry.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:35]** No, I am going to talk.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:37]** It's that prison thing that they were talking about.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** Is it the sauna?

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:38]** No, it's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:38 - 01:06:45]** You look over to your left and you see that there is a bedding off to the left.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:50]** And then off to the right, there's a small console that must operate the camera, the gun, everything else.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:52]** But off to the left, there's some bedding.

**[01:06:53 - 01:06:56]** You think maybe this is where Moist would sleep.

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:58]** The hallway is concrete.

**[01:06:59 - 01:06:59]** He's got a bed.

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:01]** It's all sticky and gross.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:06]** The hallway is concrete and extends to the left about 30, 40 feet.

**[01:07:06 - 01:07:09]** And there's a single door off at the end of the hallway.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:12]** And then it curves around to the right.

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:20]** And Rick19, you can see that there is at least one door, maybe 20 feet diagonally up from you.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:23]** And the hallway extends beyond what you can see.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:29]** You're in front, Colin's behind you, Dr. K's behind you, Bernice is behind Dr. K, and Hears is still around the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:31]** Hears is running away in Thaddeus style.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:41]** Rick Hears is not... Rick is going to move up to the right to try to get a view down that hallway.

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:45]** And he sees that the hallway to the left kind of ends and there's only a door there.

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:47]** There's just lifeless concrete.

**[01:07:47 - 01:07:52]** So yeah, Rick is going to move over and get a full view of that door and then wait for the crew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:54]** Seeing Rick go to the right, Colin covers to the left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:56]** Dr. O'Keefe fills in the middle.

**[01:07:56 - 01:08:01]** Here's what you do.

**[01:08:01 - 01:08:09]** Here's kicks off the concrete now knowing that there isn't just a freaking Eldritch blast or whatever that's just going to go cut through everyone.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:10]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:36]** rick 19 you look around the corner and you see a continuation of the hallway and you see four doors one or two are like 10 feet away on either side of the hallway left and right there's another bit further down on the left and then there's a double door all the way down on the right and then the hallway seems to curve again to the left what do you want to do what does everyone want to do let me unpause

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:47]** You're infiltrating Terrapin, the place that you have gone across the literal lava planet for, and you're making your way in.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:49]** What's the thought here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:56]** I think we should start with working left to right, so we have some sort of systematic way to make sure we've got all the doors.

**[01:08:57 - 01:09:00]** Should we go ahead and grab this first door at the end of that hallway?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:01]** I concur.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:03]** I'll keep an eye on this hallway over here.

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:14]** And Rick's got it pointed down that hall in case any of those... So Rick's got a view of the hallway with four doors in it, and it kind of wraps around, so if anything comes out from that area, he would be able to engage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:17]** Colin steps over to the door to the left and listens.

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:18]** Give me a perception check, Colin.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:21]** Perception.

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:22]** Perception.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:28]** Ooh, that's an 18 on the die for 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:30]** You don't hear anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:33]** He checks the door to see if it's locked.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:38]** This one's locked too.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:42]** I'll move out of the way so somebody else can give me it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:42]** Engineering?

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:43]** Give it to me.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:47]** Either one, my friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:53]** Well, then I'll go for computers since that's my thing, I guess.

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:55]** But it's only 20 this time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:56]** I'm going to need some.

**[01:09:56 - 01:10:00]** I rolled a 32 on engineering.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:02]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:04]** I like to think Dr. O.K.

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:10]** walked up with his hands on his hips and said, engineering under the door, but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:13]** This is how Dr. O.K.

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:14]** is winning, though.

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:14]** Dr. O.K.

**[01:10:14 - 01:10:16]** is like skill guru.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:20]** Just like, this is one of your big strengths.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:23]** I only have like six really good skills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:25]** Is disguise one of them?

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:27]** Okay, pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:28]** No.

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:30]** Zero in disguise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:34]** Okay, so Dr.

**[01:10:34 - 01:10:37]** O.K., it unlocks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:10:37 - 01:10:40]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:41]** Looks like we're in business.

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:41]** All right.

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:45]** Would you like for me to open it or do you want to do the honors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:46]** Sure.

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:48]** Why not?

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:49]** I'll step back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:49 - 01:10:50]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:51]** You're more of a tank, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:51]** Yeah.

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:54]** Three, two, one.

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:57]** And Colin opens the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:57 - 01:11:01]** It's not hotter in here, Colin, but immediately as you open it, it feels heavy.

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:03]** In the room.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:04]** Yeah.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:05]** Do you step in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:08]** Yes, absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:09]** Colin goes in, Dr. Okay.

**[01:11:11 - 01:11:18]** Although you don't see anybody, Colin, you look and think, wow, this air in here is stagnant.

**[01:11:19 - 01:11:21]** There is not a lot of activity here.

**[01:11:21 - 01:11:29]** There are six hospital beds that each of them, the sheets are just flat.

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:37]** maybe with moisture and the indentation from people that have been here for hours at a time,

**[01:11:37 - 01:12:02]** over time sheets have never been changed you see two medical grade beds and a steel cabinet on the east wall and at the end of each bed is metal lockers that like rot because they just are almost never used and on top of the beds there's some medical paraphernalia

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:05]** What do you all do?

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:06]** Here's still in the hallway.

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:07]** Rick is still keeping an eye out.

**[01:12:08 - 01:12:10]** Dr. K and Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:11 - 01:12:15]** Colin immediately goes to the steel cabinet to see if there's anything useful in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:16]** Sorry, I don't have a view in the room.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:18]** Are there other doors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:19]** Yeah, there's three other doors.

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:23]** Dr. K is going to look at it.

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:28]** Based on the appearance of the door, is there any way to tell what might be behind it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:33]** Yeah, you think that the two doors... Thank you for calling that out.

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:34]** There's one door to the east and three on the north.

**[01:12:36 - 01:12:46]** Here's is up in the northwest corner, and there's a door that looks like it's just marked storage.

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:51]** The two doors next to that on the north side are clearly marked as some sort of bathroom.

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:52]** Doctor, okay.

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:52]** Okay.

**[01:12:55 - 01:13:00]** Colin, you look in the steel cabinet.

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:18]** You see that there is a, there is not too much inside except for empty canisters of Larval Caffox.

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:24]** You see two tier two sedatives.

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:57]** you look over to your left and on the table or on the two medical beds immediately are a spray flesh and an advanced med kit and then colin there there does seem to be some strange paraphernalia that you haven't seen before but maybe you have like of nodes and wires and little sensors give me a medicine or engineering check it's like the ekg


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:58 - 01:14:00]** It's a two on the die for 14 medicine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:01]** 14 medicine.

**[01:14:01 - 01:14:03]** You are not sure what this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_13

**[01:14:05 - 01:14:06]** Do you mind if I take a look at that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:08]** Go ahead.

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:10]** And he pockets the sedatives.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:16]** Oh, I was going to ask if I could have one and see if I could use it on my gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:16 - 01:14:17]** Oh, sure.

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:18]** We can spread the load.

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:23]** I've got that needler pistol that I was planning to take advantage of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_12

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:25]** Well, we'll save it for a rainy day.

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:28]** Colin, maybe you...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:54]** i got a 24 medicine so let's say dr k you walk up next to the steel cabinet and colin you're waiting while dr k is looking colin give me a perception check while i tell dr okay what he sees dr okay you think that these components are part of some sort of hybrid magic and tech item that measures not only brain waves but is able to remove

**[01:14:55 - 01:15:13]** elements of someone's personality it's like it's like it scours the mind for an understanding of an individual's personality and memories

**[01:15:13 - 01:15:23]** It must connect to some sort of circlet and allows whoever is using it to look into the life of whoever is wearing it.

**[01:15:23 - 01:15:26]** Take information, you think.

**[01:15:26 - 01:15:32]** The main apparatus is not there, but these are some of the... It's not the actual sensor, but it's the wires.

**[01:15:32 - 01:15:33]** It's other elements.

**[01:15:33 - 01:15:35]** And just by...

**[01:15:35 - 01:16:04]** cracking it open you think there is some advanced obscure and science that was definitely achieved through illegal means and pain and the at the expense of many lives in order to make machines like this you don't know of any like on the market spot that would have something like this this is too nefarious it says powered by lou yeah exactly yeah there's a there's a lot of drop

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:30]** colin you maybe you're looking over you notice that a few of the metal uh few of the metal uh what's what's the word i'm trying to say uh the lockers lockers thank you uh have writing on them hmm uh that was a dirty 20 on on perception okay brother 20 on perception do you walk over and check them out okay uh yeah

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:36]** One of the beds has a name that you don't know.

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:40]** You look at the writing, you think, yeah, that's definitely a name.

**[01:16:42 - 01:16:44]** Taj Lanner.

**[01:16:47 - 01:16:49]** Maybe you just go through.

**[01:16:50 - 01:16:51]** You're about to open it up, but then you look.

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:54]** The one right next to it in the middle has another name.

**[01:16:55 - 01:16:56]** One word.

**[01:16:57 - 01:16:58]** Effecta.

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:00]** Moist.

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:02]** E-P-H-E-C-T-A.

**[01:17:05 - 01:17:09]** The two others on the south side of the wall have nothing written on them.

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:21]** You look north, and you see that one of them has nothing, and the other one has another name on it.

**[01:17:25 - 01:17:28]** And maybe without even reading it,

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:33]** There's a pit in your stomach.

**[01:17:36 - 01:17:38]** And you step over.

**[01:17:40 - 01:17:41]** And you see the name.

**[01:17:43 - 01:17:45]** Cora Edenbrand.

**[01:17:46 - 01:17:49]** The name of your sister.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:49 - 01:17:52]** And that's our game.

**[01:17:52 - 01:17:57]** You just recognize the length and the lettering.

**[01:17:58 - 01:17:58]** Oh, my God.

**[01:17:59 - 01:17:59]** F***, dude.

**[01:18:00 - 01:18:03]** We just found out last week that you murdered that poor girl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:04 - 01:18:05]** Apparently not.

**[01:18:05 - 01:18:06]** Wait, you murdered your sister?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:18:08 - 01:18:14]** Because he found out she... Oh, my God.

**[01:18:14 - 01:18:16]** I am so moist right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:16 - 01:18:18]** The moisture is just all over me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:18:19 - 01:18:22]** Big things starting to happen here at Terrapin Station.

**[01:18:22 - 01:18:23]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:18:23 - 01:18:25]** Big things.

**[01:18:25 - 01:18:26]** The biggest things.
