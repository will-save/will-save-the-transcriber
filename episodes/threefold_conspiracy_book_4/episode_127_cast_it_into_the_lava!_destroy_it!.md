**[00:01:31 - 00:01:35]** We'll Save the Podcast.

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:36]** We'll Save the Podcast.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:10]** And then in another corner, we have a drinker of like tea or like they're just the drinker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** And then in another corner, we have blue sheets.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:17]** And then in another, we have the center.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:20]** Yeah.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:23]** And then in another drink, we have the man in black.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** You're just saying words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:47]** weirdly that is language kev saying words is actually a basic form of communication yeah i i actually am fascinated people do that on podcasts i'm fascinated by this like social contract that we all have that this particular collection of noises that we've learned to make with our mouth actually means something yes

**[00:02:47 - 00:03:02]** Because, like, something my kids like to do at dinner is they will say, Daddy, what does this, what does A-A-A-A-B-B-B-B-A-J-J-J-J-J-K-K-L-L-L-L-V-V-V-V-V-A-A-X spell?

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:06]** And then I have to somehow recreate that collection of letters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** Chris's favorite right now is B-O-B-B-Y.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:10]** And I'm like, oh, that's just Bobby.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:11]** And he loves it.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:13]** He just bursts out laughing.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** Bobby.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** That's so funny, dude.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:19]** But if he ever changes that extra, oh yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:25]** Do you ever say a word so often that the meaning becomes really weird and it starts to lose all coherence in your brain?

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** Yeah, I've had that before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** Or like type a word.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** This happens to me.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:35]** I type a word so many times and then I'm like, did I misspell it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** Yeah.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** That little squiggly red line is my saving grace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:40 - 00:04:02]** between that and i have i before e because i get i get stuck on the i before e and i always lose the except after c part and so i cannot spell receive to to save my life there's so many exceptions to that it's not just so many exceptions to that yeah it's like crazy english is hard weekends holidays all throughout may yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:04]** English is a weird, weird language.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:07]** It's probably the most, the most, uh, has the most exceptions.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:11]** I think any language probably all told.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:13]** Would you just call that like a really lawless language?

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:16]** Just totally completely without rules.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** Just, you can just kind of say what you want, come up with it.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:20]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:21]** Yeah.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:21]** Fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Make up words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Yeah.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** Got that German influence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** Right.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:37]** There are so many other languages that are just portmanteaued into a single collection of noises that the words are made up and the points don't matter.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** What was that word there, Vinny?

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** They were what into a collection?

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** Portmanteaued.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** Don't ask me to spell it.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** I have zero hope.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:44]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:46]** This feels like case in point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:49]** Is that one word or is that like a compound word?

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** Portmanteau is one word.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:53]** It's to like take two things and just kind of smash them together.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:56]** Or take more than one thing and just smash it together.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:59]** P-O-R-T-M-A-N-T-E-A-U, I believe.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** So I guess it's French.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** I think you're right.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:02]** It's a French word.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:07]** Also, apparently it's a leather suitcase that opens into two hinged compartments.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** So is that Bernice?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Is Bernice a portmanteau?

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** Bernice is a portmanteau.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:14]** Maybe.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:21]** There's some stylish portmanteau luggage I'm looking at that could fit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:24]** One pocket's got a knife and the other pocket's got a gun.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** That's it.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** It's the same item, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:35]** I think that we need a, we'll say portmanteau now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** Ooh.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:36]** Yeah.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:42]** You gotta get on a supplier from, uh, I don't know who makes a portmanteau.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:46]** Are portmanteaus like the briefcase or suitcase?

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:54]** Are they kind of like, uh, is it champagne or what's the other alcohol that if it's not actually from that region of France, it's not called a portmanteau?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** No.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** Champagne.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** Burgundy from Burgundy.

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:58]** Burgundy.

**[00:05:59 - 00:05:59]** Riesling?

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:00]** Yeah.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** Riesling.


## Speaker_0

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** I don't know.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:06]** I actually don't know much about wine, to be honest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** I don't either, except that a lot of it tastes good.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** I like tasty things.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:10]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** I like tasty things, too.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** Did this just become a food banter?

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:14]** No.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:14]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:20]** I was just going to say, before we go into another food banter, I have a question for your characters.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** Very quick question.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:28]** What music would your character be listening to in the car?

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:33]** you know, like, in the drive across Veros, what's the music that y'all would be playing?

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:38]** You know, it's like, oh, hey, have you heard this new track by... Strawberry Machine Cake?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:38]** Yeah.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:46]** I feel like Colin is the, like, yacht rock, like... Taking us to the street.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:46]** Yeah.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** Classic.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:50]** Rolling the Eagles, rolling some Steely Dan.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** Some Doobie Brothers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:53]** Some Doobie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:56]** Let's go to the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:56 - 00:07:02]** Classic, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** It's actually just the acapella version.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:06]** Colin's really into acapella.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:12]** It's a monk throat singing cover of Hotel California.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:17]** It's a version unencumbered by instruments, as they say.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** Anyone else?

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:19]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:26]** I think Rick would listen to French rap, but it's actually just in Akatonian, so it's like Akatonian rap.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:29]** It's rap in a different language.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** It's pretty hardcore.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:34]** Now I just want to go rock some French rap.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:36]** Lauren had a whole bunch of it on her iPod one time.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:36]** It was awesome.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** I was like, this is great.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:41]** It's not as hard as American rap.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:44]** It's not all gangster rap stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** That you know of.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:49]** It could be French gangsters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** I speak enough French.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:53]** Wait, what?

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:55]** You speak French?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:15]** and for our listeners who aren't quite 30 an ipod was what we used before you could play music directly from your phone and had it with you all the time you had to have a separate thing just to listen to music from yeah that was cool before that you had a walkman and you like would record off the radio onto blank tapes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:15]** Yes.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** Yeah.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:23]** Before that, you would put a vinyl, you would put a record player in your car and then just attach that to the stereo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** Oh, you had 8-tracks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** It would just like get interrupted.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:29]** And before that, even, people would try to do that.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** It's like radio.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:53]** radio waves were were being used in the 1930s oh yeah right you would actually like set a dial and just listen to what other people played and a lot of times it was like manual and you basically like are like fine tuning it and then if somebody like hit it or you adjust the volume and accidentally slip you like completely lose it yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:53 - 00:09:05]** As technically the youngest person on this show, I'm going to apologize to everyone else who's younger than me for these cantankerous folks talking down to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:08]** No, I like the young thing.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:10]** I don't like even commercials.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:14]** I haven't seen a commercial in years because of streaming services and stuff.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:17]** When I see a commercial, I just want to flip a table.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:17]** What?

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:17]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** What streaming services are you using?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:21]** Everyone except Hulu, obviously.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:24]** And then he's paying for the premium ones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** Every one of my streaming services has commercials all of a sudden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:29]** We're pirating it like our forefathers.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:33]** Pirating is pirated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:34]** Please.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:36]** With that said...

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:39]** Kelly, what would be your song that's commercial-free?

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** What would he choose?

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:47]** Did he install a sound system in the cars when he was unlocking them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:47]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:53]** He installed the Sirius Radio 90-day free trial.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** Yeah.

**[00:09:54 - 00:10:00]** It just plays with channel one.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** That's like all the topics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:11]** He's probably listening to audio books and it's basically like a 30 year reading of one of the books of Harry Potter by someone named Kevin E. Decker.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:14]** Because it takes a while for Kevin to get through books just reading it, right?

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** So it's just like Kevin...

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Ouch.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:19]** And then it was like, he sighs.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:20]** He's like, oh, it's going to be a while.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** And then that's what he does.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** He doesn't really listen to music, per se.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** But it's music to his ears, because I like to hear Kevin speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:32]** Well, you'd only listen to three pages at a time, and then you'd only get one episode every three or four weeks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:34]** Is that how it works, too?

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** That's why I like the way this podcast is.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:39]** You just get an hour at a time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:42]** No, this podcast comes out weekly, and you get a good solid hour.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:44]** I read until I fall asleep, which is only two or three pages.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** And then I don't pick it back up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** I'm in the same boat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:49]** I'm still in the same book from a year and a half.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** That makes sense for you.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:53]** I'm like 20 pages into this really esoteric book.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** And it's...

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:59]** From, like, two pages at a time over a year.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** Dr.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:07]** O.K., I feel like he listens to whatever kind of is in the mood.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:10]** Like, he has a lot of eclectic taste.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:10]** Oh, I'm sure.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:17]** I'd say top of his playlist if he was, you know, listening to some...

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:35]** earth music would be like bucket heads albino slug album some like 70s funk some yeah some classic uh classic drill trap remixes so like bach remix electronic


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:39]** That makes sense for a doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:39]** Yeah.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:41]** I think he's got a lot of tastes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:43]** Does he make custom playlists?

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:43]** I think he does.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** They're probably on Spotify.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** They're probably on Spotify.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:48]** And that's what he always goes to.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** He never searches for the track.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:52]** He's like, oh, no, I've got it in this playlist.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** 70s Funk, though.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:57]** That's such a banger.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** 70s Funk.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:08]** When we were at the Gen Con house with SCF, they were playing some funk one time, and I heard some tunes that I hadn't heard in a while from this band called Mandrill.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:10]** Hot band.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** Hot, good times.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** That was a good time.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:18]** Hey, before we get into the ep, I want to take a moment, be a little serious here.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:19]** I'm going to...

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Turn down the music for a second.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:21]** Hit stop here.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:31]** Just want to acknowledge a couple things that are happening right now for us and a lot of other people in California and also across the country right now.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:36]** There's a lot of intense, dangerous weather conditions and natural disasters happening.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:37]** I'm not experiencing it.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:40]** Maybe some of you might be, or Vinny.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:44]** There's a large winter storm that's hitting the south, southeast, east coast.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** That's supposed to bring in a lot of inclement weather.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:50]** So we are thinking about you all.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:52]** We want you to stay warm, stay home, stay safe.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:56]** Here in SoCal, we're dealing with the opposite.

**[00:12:56 - 00:13:19]** the devastating loss terrifying conditions as wildfires are like swarming the city surrounding them there's a new one every hour john and i are literally surrounded by fire we are we are we are we are currently safe in our little silver lake corner which is why we're like able to record and but we are monitoring the apps we like if you are listening if you're in this

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** We are thinking about all of you.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:43]** If there's any way that you want to provide support, like monetarily, you can obviously Google a lot of these things.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:51]** A small selection of these places are like the LAFD, the Los Angeles Food Bank, the Pasadena Humane Society, World Central Kitchen.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** Go to GoFundMe.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:56]** There are a lot of people I know that are reaching out on GoFundMe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** A lot of people, lost homes, stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:58]** Yeah.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:58]** Yeah.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** Folks that are, you know, private.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:03]** donations, wherever you're able to help.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:05]** They are very, very grateful.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:09]** So we're thinking about you and we hope that you are okay.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:14]** And also, if you know anybody who lives in these areas, check in on them.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** Make sure that they're okay.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:18]** They will probably appreciate it.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:19]** Anyone else want to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:21]** Just, you know, help.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:25]** It's a good time to help your neighbors in Southern California.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:34]** And, you know, our thoughts and our help is available here for, you know.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:41]** people affected by it, checking on the elderly infants to smoke inhalation, stuff like that.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:43]** It's not great.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:43]** Yeah.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:51]** Not just, not just the damage and loss of like property and stuff, but people, people died.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:57]** Um, people have stayed behind when maybe they should have left.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:59]** Like, don't, don't make that choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:07]** There are some people chasing the Instagram clout, sticking around places.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** Also, f*** looters.

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** Don't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:10]** Yeah, truly.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:15]** Since we're surrounded by fire.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:24]** Yeah, as Will brought up in our internal pre-recording.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:28]** Since we're surrounded by fire, let's roleplay Surrounded by Fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:32]** Let's go into our safe space where we can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:34]** It's like we're on a planet and it's just burning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Always.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:37]** At least fine.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** It's fine.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:41]** As I get WatchDuty notifications on my phone.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:42]** All right.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** Let's get back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:47]** Can I talk conspiracy theory before you go back into it?

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:48]** Sure, bro.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:49]** Not about the fires.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:53]** Yeah, I was like, where is this going?

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:55]** Yeah, about three full conspiracies.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** The real conspiracies.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:03]** John has been harping for a long time now that the Reptoids are not Reptoids.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:06]** They're supposed reptoids, and we've never confirmed that.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:09]** He's been doing an on-air and off-air, and it's really digging into me.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:17]** And now I'm thinking about how Tricolas blew up with the kill switch button.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** What if this is just another gray thing?

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:31]** It's not necessarily a full-on gray simulation, but what if the grays are using their same brain wash over of the stewards to

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** And they're controlling them.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:37]** And then what do these people in this dome have any connection to all of that?

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:39]** And this whole palace obscure up to .

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:41]** Those are the thoughts that are on my head.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** That's all.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:47]** But now I'm really concerned that like all the people that were on that base are dead now.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:50]** And they were actually people, not Reptoids.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** And we're not dealing with Reptoids at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** What if they were never alive?

**[00:16:53 - 00:17:14]** they were like why today's the anniversary or like uh they're like an ant like an animus like uh um oh uh like assassin's creed like they're reliving their ancestors lives or or something oh maybe the wrong words anime but like uh do you mean like an avatar


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** Oh, well, no, that could very well be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:27]** They're like just a husk of parts that you put your conscious into.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:31]** They're like a sleeve from Altered Carbon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:52]** alter carbon good show good book too i enjoyed the book oh it is good well yeah oh you you've finished a book wow it has words that has words that we used it was the audio i don't know what that's like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:59]** Words spoken?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** You can speak words?

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** By someone else?

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** Words that you know?

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** Okay, John.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:09]** You can go back to... Good conspiratorial thinking.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:11]** That's what we want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** That's what we want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** That's what you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:16]** I know, you were sitting there giggling while we were having this conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:18]** I just want to see what's at Terrapin Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:29]** I feel like what we want is answers, and what you want is for us to beat ourselves to death thinking about what is going on.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** No, not beat yourselves to death.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** That would not be good.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** Maybe not to death.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:35]** Twist our conscious in knots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** Not ourselves.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** That's his job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:38]** Yeah.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** That's my job.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:44]** Let's do a quick flyover.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:47]** Let's go back a little bit before you even get to this dome.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** Because...

**[00:18:49 - 00:19:07]** I want to think about how you decided after your escape from Tyrcalis and the subsequent destruction of Tyrcalis, presumably by the leader of the base, Stewards Inspector Joxherd, that your next best course of action is Terrapin.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** Why Terrapin?

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:12]** I think some of the reasons that... Because it's the only thing on the map?

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** Possibly.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:16]** Although, is there more on the map that you haven't found?

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** I could say so much about it.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:21]** Also, is there more... I mean, there's more to the moon than Varos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:26]** Yeah, but don't try to distract us from what you planted.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:30]** You made that station because it's not in the threefold conspiracy.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** I know it's not.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:36]** So then, like, this is a... The reason why I wanted to go there is because you created it.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:39]** So I'm, like, curious what that might mean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** How do you know that, Kelly?

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:43]** This is like a conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:47]** Because he's been reading the book like the assigned homework says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:48]** Yeah, I've been reading the book.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:51]** Everyone's about to get really pissed too.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:53]** Why do you think I wanted this to sleep before the dump?

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** I knew what was going on.

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:08]** Sorry to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to take you off the tracks with this, but like, and anyone that doesn't want to know this kind of cool thing, please, like if you're listening or like mute, but like, but we talked about this in the music channel.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** I can't remember who brought it up.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:11]** Adam talked about it and then someone else.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:20]** I'm sorry if I'm forgetting who it is, but like, if you look at the lyrics of Terrapin Station by the Grateful Dead, there's so many things in there that relate to our characters.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:26]** So if you, if you have time, read the lyrics of the song, Terrapin Station, you will see how it could be related to what we're going through.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:29]** That's why I wanted us, that's why I really want to go there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:32]** So I want to see what might be there.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** You think it's a John insert?

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:35]** Not necessarily that.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** I think it is.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:41]** The people at Paizo are Grateful Dead fans and named this station after that.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** A Terrapin's also just a turtle.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:46]** Well... Because... Okay.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** The Maryland mascot is the Terrapins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:52]** But if you look at the lyrics of Terrapin Station...

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:54]** If John planted it.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:56]** In the shadow of the moon.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** It would work really well.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:04]** It talks about a spacefaring, what is some kind of like spacefaring captain or some shit like that and a bunch of other things.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** Like, I'm not sure if there's a murder bot mentioned.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:09]** I can't entirely recall, but I thought there was like some kind of thing like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:12]** Storyteller makes no choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:15]** I have reason to think that John planted it.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:23]** I hope I'm not wrong, but there's some thing that made me realize it without giving the book away to myself or whatever.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:27]** But that's what I think, based on some very light investigation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:31]** I hope I don't come to... Some very light investigation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** I hope I'm not wrong.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:34]** All right, that's all.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** But that's why I'm like, I really think we should check it out.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** Yeah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:40]** Well, that's one reason.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:41]** You mean it attracts?

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** No, no, no.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** That's one reason.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** That's one reason why you decided to go there.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:55]** Consider the reason that possibly the only other survivors of the Tyrcalis base explosion were in a ship that you know as the Voidcrier.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:59]** And you tracked that ship in the direction of Terpin.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:06]** That's your best guarantee right now for a way off world and to see who made it out of the base.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:10]** Also, remember that all... It's also close, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** Yeah, it's close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:15]** Yeah, it's close enough.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:23]** All comms traffic is funneled through Terrapin, so ship or not, that's your only way to get a message out.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:44]** And recall that when you were messaging, too, when you hacked into the Tyrkales computer, you discovered that the stewards, not only, according to the messages, were Reptoids, but you were messaging about you with Reptoid Masters?

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:47]** In Roselight?

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:50]** On Roselight, the famous floating city on the Avara.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** Roselight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:56]** And you also saw that comms were being funneled into a small dome structure on a remote part of Veros.

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:02]** So on your way to Terrapin, lo and behold, you see a small dome structure.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** Decide to investigate.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Stop there for the night.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:09]** Get off at the exit that says small dome structure.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:11]** And then flash forward.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** Knock, knock.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:24]** The pause is very long until you hear this like whispering behind the door.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:28]** And you think to yourself, huh?

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:35]** And then voices talk and they say, we'll come out if you back up 15 feet from

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** You eventually meet a human male and female.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** They are tired.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:48]** They look beaten down, but also scared, cornered, like wild animals pushed into a corner.

**[00:23:49 - 00:24:03]** They're wearing these blue jumpsuits and they make you speak in a zone of truth and start to ask you kind of these like really odd questions, these bizarro questions like,

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** Where is Palace Obscura?

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:07]** Where is Hex House?

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:11]** Are you here for the test?

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:21]** And then when you all don't respond in a manner that fits with their expectations, they sort of initiate combat?

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:24]** I mean, technically they do for the game, but also like...

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:26]** You know, they act in a fool.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:31]** They act a little bit of a fool and they tell Rick 19 to act a little bit of a fool.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:35]** Charming Rick to go inside like a good friend.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:38]** He does obeys her suggestion to go inside.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:42]** You see that the man has run inside and is working with some sort of battery or computer core.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** Dr. OK, here's Bernice.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:49]** You all get off these like great shots on the woman.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** Colin, you head inside.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:52]** You fascinate the man.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** And then we ended this.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:57]** with the woman looking at Rick's gun.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:14]** And I said last time as a note that as we get back into it and I bring you guys over to the map as we get back into combat round two here, I said last time that the gun starts to move on its own.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:18]** And that was a mistake, as I have come to find out.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:20]** And I'll tell you guys more about that later.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:28]** But in the meantime, what happens instead is that Rick 19, you see her looking at you.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:30]** You see her looking at your gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:37]** And then she shouts, Cairo, snap out of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:40]** And then she literally snaps her fingers.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:45]** And when she does, the light inside the dome goes out.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:54]** Shrouding it in darkness for Rick 19, Colin, and the man named Cairo.

**[00:25:55 - 00:26:24]** only lit i'll say it's dim light because it's only lit by this bubbling gold lava with these multicolored hues in it it reminds you a bit of an oil slick combined with the lava that's in the ground right outside and with that that was her turn she then well actually she does one more thing she does one more thing she reaches over

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** And she shuts the door.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:32]** So she spends a move action to shut the door.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:35]** She says, Cairo snap out of it.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:41]** And then she turns off the light inside with a snap of her fingers.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** Rick19, it's your turn.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:44]** Middle of round three.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:48]** You are inside, standing next to Cairo.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:49]** Colin is next to you.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** The door is shut.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:50]** The lights are out.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** It's dim light.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:54]** You can only see the light of this bubbling pool.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:57]** Dr. OK Bernice and Hears are outside with this woman.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:58]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:01]** Am I still fascinated?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:06]** You are still under the effect.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** We are in round two.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** It was a two rounder.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:17]** I believe the old two rounder, as they say, it lasts for duration.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:18]** Where was it?

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** No, sorry.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:23]** Duration five hours.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:27]** So right now, you are still her.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** Yep.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** I really lied on that one.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** It's not two rounds at all.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:33]** Duration is for five hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:38]** So Rick is going to look at, is it Cairo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:41]** Yeah, that's what she calls him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:44]** Look, Cairo, what is happening here?

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** What are you doing?

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:49]** As if he's talking to a friend because he's fascinated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:52]** Quick correction.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** Charmed, not fascinated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:54]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** Yeah, he's charmed.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:57]** Kyro's fascinated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:01]** Can I roll a diplomacy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:02]** Sure.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:04]** He's fascinated, though.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:10]** So he can't really take another action for, I think, another one more turn.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:16]** So round three, he still can't take an action unless somebody attacks him.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** And then it breaks it.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:21]** I thought you said she snapped him out of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** No, but she's trying.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:27]** She said snap out of it and then she turned off the light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:32]** I thought she was actually doing a spell to remove that from him.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:32]** Who knows?

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** I'm pretty sure my diplomacy is like a plus two.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:38]** Give it a roll.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:43]** I feel like I can do diplomacy on a friend, right?

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:45]** That's a 12 on the die.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** Hold on, it did load.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:50]** He's not your friend, per se.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:55]** You were friendly with her, so I guess technically, by extension, you're friendly with him.

**[00:28:55 - 00:29:15]** not quite the same friendly enough that i'm like hey man tell me what's going on here uh with a 15 with a 15 okay 15 total sorry 15 you asked 15 total uh what's what's gonna happen okay you want to do anything else with your turn uh uh no okay no i don't because i feel like my the charm spells


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:38]** got control i think that's that's right yeah dr k you're outside you've just seen the door shut as she said that was a big mistake lady and uh he's gonna full attack with the the needle air pistol so i get a minus four like from halo shoot shoot shoot


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** That was pretty intense, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:43]** Okay, first one is a definite miss with an eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:45]** Yeah, that's a miss.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** It's a miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** Okay.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** That was 15?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:53]** 15 against... To hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:56]** Against EAC, I think?

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:57]** No.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:59]** I think it's K, maybe?

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** KAC?

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:02]** It's the needle or pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** Yeah, I think it's KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:04]** Projectile.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** That is a hit!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** Ha ha!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:08]** Nice.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:14]** She's going to get a little taste of the pharmacological inhibitor.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** Ooh.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:20]** So roll a fortitude save, and I'm going to roll for damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:23]** Oh, actually, can I highlight real quick?

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** I got a new die from UR Wizards.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:29]** I'll post a picture of it because I can't really do it too well.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** Is it like mine from UR Wizards?

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** No, because yours has ****, right?

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** Which is awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:37]** No, mine's a volcano because I knew that...

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:55]** we're on arrows and also it's like all uv so it like lights up a little bit it's pretty cool it's pretty sweet i like it i'll send a picture in the chat you can see like the lava coming down the side anyway it fails you thank you that's a 17 on my fortitude safe you got max


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:55]** Okay.

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:00]** Well, you're still encumbered, but you're not entangled.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** I'm not entangled.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:01]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:03]** Oh, but I'm encumbered now, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:05]** Because I was.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Yes, you are encumbered.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:09]** Because I was fatigued, and now I'm encumbered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:11]** No, no, no.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:15]** It gives you the encumbered condition, so I don't know if that actually pushes you down.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:43]** uh further but well now i'm encumbered and fatigued the encumbered condition yikes okay and how many hit points of damage um you got nine points man max damage whoa did you not you don't know what her life story is she doesn't like that damage she might not want that bernice is gonna follow suit as well oh she's she's also gonna shoot a needler full attack

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** No, not the needler, though.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:48]** I don't think she can full attack.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** I don't think she can either.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:56]** And that's what the vapor cavitation pistol, which I believe is EAC.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** And I rolled a 16.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:02]** Dude, stop killing my characters, please.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** That's a hit.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** That's a hit.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** Hit.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** And.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** You don't want to hear that thing talk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** Yeah.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:10]** Right.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** Four more points.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** Four more points of damage.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:15]** Of the damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:18]** She was not expecting that.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:21]** Is she concentrating on this charm or is this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:23]** That's a great question.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** I don't think so.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:26]** I don't think she needs.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:26]** Okay.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:26]** Yeah.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:27]** She doesn't need to.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:28]** There's no.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:31]** I don't believe that there's a concentration check for this.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:32]** Okay.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:33]** If I'm wrong, then let me know.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:39]** Dr. Okay, you want to move after your freaking beatdown of this woman?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:41]** No, I did the full attack.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:44]** I did two attacks, so I can't move.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:44]** Okay.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** Yeah, you can't move.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** You can't move.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** Right, right, right.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:50]** So, yeah, I'm going to stay in range of your spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** Okay.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** Okay.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:55]** Which the spell that you had cast, though.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:57]** No, you threw the pheromone grenade.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:20]** right yeah yeah yeah yeah which is that's the circle that we're seeing here which is what was keeping cairo there okay colin you're inside it is dark the store was shut the light was sent out what do you do um i think do i hear gunfire outside through the door yeah i would think so


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:38]** for sure yeah the vapor cavitation pistol for sure for sure yeah just a huge shot for sure i'm actually i was thinking about dropping the uno reverse card in charming cairo


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:38 - 00:34:05]** but what that seems like a waste of a first level spell slot right now um i'm going to it's gonna be move to here where is here here is one step closer to the door okay you just shift along the back of the door slide yeah slide to the left slam in with your shoulder hurts your shoulder i'm gonna use a cantrip called


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:14]** telekinetic projectile and I'm just going to grab like a rock from the ground and just like fling it at Kyra.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:15]** Okay.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:20]** I want to fling it at Rick, but I don't think it would break the charm because I think it has to be from the person that charmed him.

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:24]** And that's something that Colin would know because he has charm person.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:32]** So I guess GM ruling, if I hit Kev, will it snap him out of this charm or does it have to be the ally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** That's a great question.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** Or by ally, you mean... The charmer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:43]** I think it's charmer or anybody on... Or their ally, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** Non-ally.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:50]** And act by you, meaning the spellcaster, or your apparent allies that threatens the charm creature breaks the spell.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:53]** So if Cairo attacks... Yeah.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:56]** If Cairo attacks, it will break.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:59]** You have also broken the fascination.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:02]** of Cairo by throwing a rocket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** Only if I hit him, though, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** I think it's fascinated.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:11]** Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at you automatically ends in condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** Cool.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:16]** Well, we'll just drop that right in the bucket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** Just disarm him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** Is he armed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:23]** You can see that he has guns on him, but he didn't try and pull out any weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:28]** He was trying to reach for a button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:32]** He's reaching down to this computer core battery thing.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:37]** The enemy cannot use his hand to hit the button if he does... If he doesn't have a button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:41]** If he doesn't... Starship troopers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:42]** Oh.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:44]** If the button is in his mind.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** So what's it going to be?

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:49]** I'm going to flick a projectile at him.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:49]** Okay.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:50]** Flick!

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** Right in the fucking bucket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:51 - 00:36:15]** let's play paper football if you disable his hand if you disable his hand awesome okay what's that roll 15 on the die plus six bro that's that's a that's a touchdown on a paper football shot did you actually move to the left or not uh no okay i just moved toward the door

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** You just did a little shuffle.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** That's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:18]** That's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:18]** Cool.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** Yeah.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** Yeah.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** Boom.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:26]** Flies off the floor, shakes a little bit, and then hits him in the back of the head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:26]** Yep.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:30]** And damage is... What is the damage?

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:32]** I'm trying to figure out what the damage is.

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:33]** I don't see it in the spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:37]** Of telekinetic... You're going to go with either 1d6 or 1d4?

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:43]** Plus some sort of... Some sort of thang...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:45]** How long has it been since we've done combat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:46]** Yeah, a long time.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** It's 1D6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** Perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:55]** Let me know what you do as you click that rock.

**[00:36:55 - 00:37:01]** He makes the finger gun and just like... And hits him for four points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Four points of damage.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:03]** Oh.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:05]** And then slides right back up.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Slide right back up.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Okay.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** So you're standing right in front of him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** You can't do two moves.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:10]** Huh?

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** You can do two moves.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:12]** You can move and spell move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:12]** I can move.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:13]** You can move, spell move.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** Wait.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** I thought you didn't move at the beginning.


## Speaker_0

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:16]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:46]** I did I was right next to him I moved away I shot my thing and then I moved back in got it I don't think that he also as when when he was fascinated I I guess it doesn't say but I don't think he can take an attack of opportunity no because he wouldn't be like so yeah but now you've tipped your hand and I know that you can move cast move yeah I have a feat called agile casting which means as a full uh action I can move cast a spell and then move again


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** Pretty sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** Now everyone knows, including them.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** They also know.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** Just by transference, that's how that happens.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** Okay.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:55]** Good move, Colin.

**[00:37:56 - 00:38:02]** Lots of attacks coming the way of these weird questioning Palace Obscura people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** Here's, what are you doing?

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:11]** Here's is going to use his really sexy spell cache of unlimited, at the moment, magic missiles.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:12]** Just keep firing magic missiles.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** Unlimitedly.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** For the time being.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:40]** just yeah yeah yeah 20 all at once no i still have to do uh the regular roll so i do have a little bit of a modifier for that but so i'm gonna roll them now we got uh i'm adding up the totals as i go five plus four plus three five plus four plus three plus half of half of my um

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:43]** Technomancer level, which is also 3 in that case.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** 5, 4, so 9, 12.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** Plus.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** 15.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:51]** 15 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:51]** Yeah.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** Wow, bro.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:53]** Can you not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:56]** No, I cannot.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:58]** Does he do... We have like...

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** Finger pistols?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:02]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:05]** And he has like... Dude.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** She chose violence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:12]** She's getting pretty... She's getting pretty hurt.

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:15]** You can see blood starting to seep through the jumpsuit.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:20]** She is starting to grab her arm where she's been hit and her leg.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** You want to do anything else?

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:22]** You want to move?

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** How much damage total was that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** 15?

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:26]** A lot of arteries in the leg.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:30]** Very vulnerable area.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** I'm reading something.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** Is that what you say?

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:42]** He's also saying like, I've been reading that like you really can't effectively do diplomacy or intimidation or whatever in combat without spending a full minute doing it.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:49]** This is, I can't remember if we've handled that before or not, but following that, I'm not going to try to do that.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:53]** So he's just going to say that, you know, and there's a lot of arteries in that area.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** Like, so just letting you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:56 - 00:40:03]** We're living up to all of our Gen X fandom who just want us to kill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** Yeah, right, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** I think that was it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:10]** I was actually just thinking like... Yeah, they just want us to kill.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:12]** The thing is, if there was something that...

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:30]** Like, I'll give always rule of cool, which is to say that if there's something with your intimidation, right, or like with your diplomacy that fits, that fits with your class, your character, an act, an item, something that fits in the moment, I'll always allow you to do that.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:36]** But you can't just always rely on, well, I'll just keep saying this and be like, I really hate you and I'm going to punch you in the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** But it has to be something.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:39]** I'm sorry to interrupt it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:47]** There's always the option, but in general, I'm not going to typically say like, sure, like you can just be like, I'm going to punch your lights out, kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:49]** Well, let's say that that was intimidating.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** I mean, like, you know, I mean, there's a lot of arteries in the lake.

**[00:40:53 - 00:41:21]** attack attack and here's the attack you could say like no do you want to leave this and here's saying like you know there's a lot of arteries like you could just have a nice conversation instead of going down this road that will lead to your inevitable demise i don't what shut the up is what she says back to you oh my god what about does your palace of whatever huh what what is the the palace of what palace obscura obscura


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:26]** The only way that you can intimidate her is if you make some lava strider f***ing noises.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:27]** That's it.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** That's the only way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** If you're being serious, I'll do it again.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** I'll do it if you're really, really serious.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:33]** Oh no, the lava striders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** I want to know things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:36]** I don't want to necessarily kill everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:39]** And then a herd of lava striders come over the hill.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** Oh f***, actually.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Trying to trample her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:47]** And she's been trying to record lava striders mating because they're actually an endangered species.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:50]** She's like, that's all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:50]** That's the real purpose?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** That's the real purpose?

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:56]** We've happened upon peaceful researchers just trying to record Lava Striders mating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:58 - 00:41:59]** Pact World's Geographic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:00]** We don't know for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:06]** It's just enough intrigue for the Palace of Obscura.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:10]** It's really like a research society that is here for Lava Striders.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:11]** That's it.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** That's it.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** They're actually just camera enthusiasts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:16]** We don't know for sure that these are bad guys, really.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:18]** There was no smoking gun with this kind of thing.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:20]** So that's why he wanted to, you know, turn.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:20]** Nope.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** They did try and attack you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** They did try and attack you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:28]** Yeah, but OK, but that doesn't mean everyone's trying to attack everyone because they're freaked out.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** You know what I mean?

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** There's so many factions on this one place alone.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** So like.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:35]** Alright, cool.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:35]** Anyway, whatever.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:36]** Just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:40]** Well, the attack was actually just a spell.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:51]** I mean, it's not considered... They've not done any violence towards us, but the way they approach that button and do the spell is kind of... How you do things matters, not just what you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** So just keep that in mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:55]** Yeah, this is Among Us.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:58]** They're like, one of you guys are the murderer.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:02]** I gotta push this button a million times before the timer gets up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** Top of round three.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:06]** Good round from everybody involved.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** Eject!

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:12]** And they press the button and it takes off like a spaceship.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** It just pulls out.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** That would be really funny.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:18]** No, so it's...

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:20]** It's the top of the round.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** It's Cairo's turn.

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:22]** It is dark inside.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:25]** It's only again lit by this bubbling lava.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:31]** Cairo reaches up, touches the back of their head, looks over at you, Rick.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** What did you ask again, Rick19?

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:36]** Hey, what's going on here?

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** That's a good question.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:38]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** Hey, what's going on here?

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** With a 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:43]** With a 15.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** Hey, man.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:48]** Let me check something that I just thought of.

**[00:43:50 - 00:44:17]** just thought of this i think i can do this tell me if i can't self-destruct yeah they all just fall over he looks at you and he says you're never going to find out and then he just pushes that computer core into with all the wires attached to it pushes it into the bubbling the lava oil

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:26]** And as he does it, it just starts to spark and like erupt in flame itself.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:34]** And then the entire lava itself erupts in flames.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:39]** as it's floating on the top there, short-circuiting.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:46]** And then, I think that push action is probably his standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:49]** Okay, once again, we don't know for sure that they're bad.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:55]** Okay, John's a great GM, but one thing is that every PC is super suspicious that he plays.

**[00:44:55 - 00:45:00]** So I'm just saying, like, we don't know for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:06]** And then... You mean the people in the three-fold conspiracy are suspicious?

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:07]** Very suspicious, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:11]** And then... Cairo... How dare they?

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:11]** ...runs for the door.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:16]** Colin and Rick, if you have a melee weapon out, you may take an attack of opportunity.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** I do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:21]** I do have a... Let's roll it up.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** Is the computer push considered violent?

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:26]** I mean, what'd he say to me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:28]** Also, could he do that this round?

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** Is that...

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** He was still fascinated, wasn't he?

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** It was broken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:33]** No, it broke.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:34]** Oh, okay.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** Yeah.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** Yep.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** That's the only reason why.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** By the paper football.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** It stings in the back.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:42]** He's got a little welt, you know?

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:42]** Ah!

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** Yeah.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:46]** That is a 15 to hit.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** That hits.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:47]** Nice.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Wait, wait.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Against EAC or KAC?

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:49]** KAC.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** KAC, right?

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:50]** Yeah.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** That's a miss.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** Oop!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:54]** Oh, that's a miss.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** Got him.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:59]** You think you hit and it just cuts off part of the suit.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** There's a tear.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Good attempt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:04]** Good attempt.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:08]** So did his actions break my charm?

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** Good question.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:11]** Because if they did, then I would get an AOL.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** But I personally don't think there was enough there to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** I don't think that they did either.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:19]** To threaten Rick individually?

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** I don't think so.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:21]** Yeah, no.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:22]** I don't think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:24]** Unless Rick took that statement as a threat.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:26]** He just said, you'll never learn.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** You'll never find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:35]** Rick kind of just stepped out of his way as he pushes back and then is confused as Colin hits him.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** He's like, what's going on here?

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** Let's kill Colin now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:40]** Whoa, whoa, whoa.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** Guys, guys, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** Guys, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:45]** Guys, please, please.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:49]** Outside, the woman looks at Dr. O'Kay and hears.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:56]** And then I think hears you were the last one to do the damage.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Magic missile.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** From the magic missile.

**[00:46:59 - 00:46:59]** Yeah.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:01]** That was me.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:05]** She runs forward 20 feet.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** She's encumbered.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:09]** So she walks slash half drags her leg.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:13]** and she's just eyeing you the whole time.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:18]** It's like when the camera moves, but they've done that effect so their head stays in the center of the shot, but then everything else moves.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** Her eyes are the center of the shot.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:28]** Like she is just locked on you and you feel this pressure building in your head as she's casting mind thrust.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:31]** And you need to give me

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:35]** Oh, we'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:35]** We'll save.

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:36]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:38]** Trademark 2021.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Oh, we'll save, you say?

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:41]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** I don't think we can trademark we'll save.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:45]** Unfortunately, we can trademark something.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:46]** We can't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** If anyone could, I don't think it's us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:51]** What are you going to do?

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** Just need to steal some.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** Lobbyists from Disney.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:57]** We need eternal reign over that crazy.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:57]** It's only 13.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** That's all we need to do.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** I got some mind dress.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:02]** So 13 will sit.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:07]** It's only... Rough.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** That's the DC.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** Yeah.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:12]** Unfortunately, that is not the DC.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:16]** And you are going to take...

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:24]** That's 13 points of damage as it feels as if your skull is breaking from the inside out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:27]** Emotional damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:28]** Yeah.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:29]** Yeah.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** This is that violent damage.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** I'm just suggesting.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Rick19, it's your turn.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** What are you doing inside?

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:37]** Her good friend, Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:39]** So Rick is still charmed and confused.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:42]** So I want to make a couple of rolls.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** Can I do...

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** a perception on their uniforms?

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:49]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:51]** If there's any more details or just perception check in general?

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:55]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:55]** Go ahead.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** Ooh, a 19 total.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:57]** Mm.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:59]** 19 total.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** Pretty good roll.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:12]** And I would also, before you go further, I'd also like to do a, like, computers check on the device as, like, if it was actually something or if they're crazy and it was just a pilot joke.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:13]** Mm.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** I guess perception would tell you that too.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** Mm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:17]** Yeah.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** Perception would tell you that.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** What's your computer check to know?

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** Give you a little bit more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** I'm going to roll a separate computer check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:24]** Yes, please.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:26]** I would like for you to.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:29]** That would be great.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:32]** That's a seven plus six for a total of 13.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** Okay.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:38]** Perception check on the outfit.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:41]** You recognize it as a...

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:44]** Prison outfit, for sure.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:57]** And you think to yourself with a 19, and I mean, this is a little like meta in the sense that the reason why the outfit is not orange is because orange would blend in with Varus's landscape.

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:00]** So it's blue to stand out more against the landscape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:04]** You also notice... Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** Nothing.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:06]** Okay.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** You notice there's no...

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:13]** There's no markings on it.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** Official markings.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:19]** But there's, let's say, an official bootleg marking, right?

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:24]** Kind of a hand done, right?

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** On one of the sleeves.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:36]** Right where Colin ripped it with that attack, where it ripped, you see that there's a stitching in there that says, The Sauna.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:42]** Oh, is that like the cute name, this cute nickname for the horrible hellscape of a hot prison?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:51]** You notice with the device that is now sparking and flickering, this is a pretty high tech device.

**[00:50:53 - 00:51:17]** combination device of battery can support some systems like a limited amount kind of makes sense with the scale of devices that you see here it's not going to support a full broadcast or studio or large set of equipment but it's going to support some things and it also serves as like a like a mini pc in a way and and comms equipment it's kind of like an all-in-one box

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:34]** that you can take anywhere, and you think these things are pretty durable because they're designed to be out in the field used by people like, you know, Xeno Wardens who are trying to get the mating calls of Lava Striders, right?

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** It's meant to be pretty durable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:39]** Durable enough to survive being thrown into lava?

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** That would be quite a thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:44]** You may have to find out after this combat's over.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:46]** What else do you do with your turn, Rick19?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:51]** Think about how good of a friend you are to this one.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:55]** Well, he's still charmed, so he's going to be like, Kyro, Colin, what are you doing?

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** Please stop.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:59]** Because he thinks that's two friends fighting at this point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** Okay.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:01]** Okay.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** I like it.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** Playing into the role play.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:05]** Let's jump back outside.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** The scene shifts back outside.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:11]** Dr. Okay, you've just seen Hears cry out in pain and go, ah, that hurt.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:15]** And then you saw the woman run up 20 feet.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** And where's she going?

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:22]** She was looking at here's, but where's she trying to go?

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** What do you do?

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:25]** Is she holding a... Does she have a melee weapon out?

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:28]** She does not have a weapon out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Good question.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** How would you escape these?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** Bernice Blaster.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:35]** Nice.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:42]** Bernice is going to do his cavitation pistol in melee range.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:47]** And I think Dr. O'Keefe is going to do the same thing.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:52]** Does a... Oh, I should have done this backwards.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** It's fine.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:55]** Does a 14 hit EAC?

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** It does hit EAC.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** EA sizzles.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** All right.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:03]** She gets two points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:26]** two points fire damage oh singes her bald head looking not in my head i just shaved it um she is looking really hurt really really hurt yeah uh dr okay is gonna try and finish her off with a 17 no more than that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:49]** 23 23 absolutely hits she's 10 feet away from you what's it gonna be uh damage is gonna be another figure yep nine points of damage and i'm gonna hit her with the basic inhibitor

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:52]** to reduce her AC by two.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:53]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** Both EAC and KAC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:56 - 00:54:00]** It just says a basic inhibitor reduce AC by two.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** So yeah, I'm assuming both.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:02]** Probably both.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:03]** Wow.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** Oh man.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:04]** All right.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:09]** Her movements instantly become more sluggish.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** Inhibited?

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:11]** Sorry?

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** Her movement becomes inhibited?

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:14]** Her movement.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:17]** The muscles are, what's the word for it?

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** Slowed down.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** Like they're covered in molasses.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:24]** It's inefficient?

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** In, yeah.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:29]** In portmanteau, I think is the term that the French use.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:35]** So she is slowed down.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:54]** absolutely looks like pauses visibly pauses for a second and is clearly about to gather her strength for maybe one last turn well done doctor okay well done colin what is she running from though back inside words what is she doing colin what do you do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:55 - 00:55:00]** Colin says he turns to Kyra.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:00]** Dr.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:00]** O.K.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** 's going to move.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** That makes sense, Dr. O.K.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:05]** That makes sense.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** Where'd he move to?

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:08]** Where'd you move to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** I can't see anything.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:12]** Dr. K is going to move by the cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:14]** Move in between the cars.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** Okay, got it.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:16]** Just run her over with a car.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** Yeah.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** Yeah, right.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:21]** It would be the first time.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:25]** It would be the first time.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:27]** Colin, what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:32]** I'm going to do it right next to him because I don't think he has a melee weapon out.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:41]** I'm going to turn to him and say, I don't think you're going to make it out of here.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:45]** And does exactly what his colleague did.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** Casts mind thrust.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:53]** He's going to thrust his mind with your pelvis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:55]** So make a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:55 - 00:56:01]** Save with my super awesome volcano die.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:02]** What is that?

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** Okay, that's what I thought.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** Come on, don't fail me now.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** Blast off.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:09]** Clean with a 22.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:11]** Does that pass?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:15]** If it does pass, but it only halves the damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Only halves the damage.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:21]** You can have your damage.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:23]** So that is ten halves to five.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** Five points of damage.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:29]** As his body, I think, just slams forward a little bit.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:33]** And maybe some of the damage comes from the fact that you crushed his brain.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** That's like four points of damage.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:38]** And one point of the damage comes from his head just slamming into the wall as he was running forward.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:41]** Just like, oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:41 - 00:57:10]** yeah oh hang on what sort of tomfoolery oh so now you're deciding that you cast it nah you probably cast it at first level right I think it's 2d10 I did but it's like when I look at it in hero lab it's only available as a level 2 yeah I mean you have to decide which one you're gonna put it in but I don't think that that changes like if you want to cast it at second level you can and at second level I think it's more it's 4d10 right

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** Yeah, it's 4d10.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:14]** That's why I was saying I need to roll more dice because I didn't see it.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:18]** But if you have a second level spell in your spell list, you can cast it at the first level.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** Is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** You can.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:22]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** You can darn well.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:23]** Cool.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:25]** But it uses a first spell slot.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:25]** Right.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:26]** So mind thrust.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:27]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:27]** All right.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:29]** Yep.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:29]** I think that's fine.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** I'm not worried about it.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:31]** Go ahead.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** Do your worst.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** No, that's it.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:33]** I'm done.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** Okay.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** All right.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:36]** What's going to happen next?

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** Back outside.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** Here's Fabricius.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** You were just mind-thrusted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:42]** Yeah.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:43]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:46]** Keep your dirty claws out of my head.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** Giving him that business.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:50]** And then he's going to... He snaps his fingers.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** Another three missiles come out.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** Give me a second.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:02]** One, two, five, three, plus three, two, five, three, plus three.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** Seven missiles.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:05]** Eight.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** Eleven points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:11]** Getting some real Deadpool vibes from this woman.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:12]** Eight points of damage.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** Eleven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:14]** Eleven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:17]** Eleven points of damage.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:26]** Whatever breath she took, looking down at her feet, she looks up at you and just magic missiles hit her.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:30]** And she falls down backwards, dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** Hooray!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:35]** You have killed the woman outside.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:37]** Really didn't want to have to do that.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** Kevin's no longer charmed, right?

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:43]** And Kevin is no longer charmed.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** Oh.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:49]** Kevin, something snaps, and you're like, they're not.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** Why did I think they were friends?

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** That is weird.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:54]** That is weird.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:59]** I'm going to cover her in blood with this new token effect that I got on Foundry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:01]** Directive initiated.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:03]** Kill sequence engaged.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:04]** Must murder.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:08]** Shout out if you're in Foundry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:11]** Did I miss an AOL?

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:13]** I thought I did.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:23]** The token magic module is really cool and it allows you to add blood to tokens or I added fire to the oil slick inside.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:27]** There's a bunch of 3D active fire going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:27]** I can't see it.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:29]** The door is closed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:31]** If only it wasn't closed.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:33]** Tears, you have just taken out this woman.

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** You've taken her life from her.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:38]** What do you do now with all that weight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** The weight of taking someone's life?

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:42]** You mean like how do I process it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:42]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:47]** He's not like Rick, but he has killed a lot of people.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** I don't want to hear the...

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:51]** He was a career pirate once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:52]** I don't want to hear your life story.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:53]** I just want to know what you're going to do with your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:57]** It's been so long since I've done combat, I can't even remember if I can move after this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:00]** I can't even remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:02]** Well, he's going to move straight into the facility.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:05]** Wait, did you fire three missiles or just two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:09]** Yeah, I did fire three, so that's right.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:12]** I was getting D&D confused with Starfinder.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:12]** You're right.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:15]** I thought that was D&D for some reason.

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Can't do anything.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:35]** super he's kind of like you know like a tuscan raider where he just puts up his hand but he just goes like but oh do like the uh the sex noises yeah exactly

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:41]** Man, I'm not he lost his he lost you can't do sex local apparently hey, that's his turn.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:04]** Let's keep this going cuz I want to see what happens because

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:13]** Cairo doesn't even look back, slams his head against the door, and then uses a move action to open the door.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:19]** Sees this woman lying there.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:27]** And there's just this incredible scream of like, NEXT!

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:30]** As he runs...

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:34]** outside, Colin, if you have a melee weapon out, you will get another AOL.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:35]** Take it.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:36]** He doesn't care.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:38]** Stab it.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:39]** Go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** That's a 16 to hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:44]** 16 is a hit.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:46]** What is your hit as he writes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** Three stabby damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:49]** Three stabby damage.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** Doesn't even notice it.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:53]** Just a little stab.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:55]** Just a quick flick of the wrist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:56]** Just a cut.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:57]** Arm goes back.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** His body keeps moving forward.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** That's two actions.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:07]** Move and move as he runs over and stands over the dead woman.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:09]** Rick19, what do you do inside?

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** You are no longer friends with her.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:14]** She's not in, you're not in her topic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:15]** She's not.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:21]** Rick, like almost as soon as he snaps out of it, his gun comes up and he points it at this guy.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** But then he kind of like...

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:43]** glances around and he realizes that computer is in the lava but like it might be durable enough if he gets it now so he's gonna lower his weapon and step towards the lava pool inside the room yeah and i i'm gonna try to pull out the computer whatever's left of it okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** Not just a murder bot.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:46]** Just a murder bot.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:49]** Also Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator 2.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:51]** Yeah, you're going to take some damage.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:54]** So you run over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:56]** Also a pretty face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:57 - 01:03:00]** He rolls back his sleeve because he knows it's going to hurt.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:02]** And you're going to reach in and grab this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** No, there were wires, I thought.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:06]** Can't you just pull it up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:08]** Yeah, you can't just grab whatever's still sticking up.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:10]** Anyways, tell me what to roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:11]** Okay.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:15]** I think you need to roll... You have nanites.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:15]** Yeah, yeah.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:17]** You could probably heal yourself.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:18]** I think it's fine.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:23]** It's not a reflex save, but it kind of is a reflex save.

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:25]** Maybe it's a dexterity check?

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:27]** Because, like...

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:32]** What is the right save for reaching into hot stuff and trying to pull something out?

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:33]** Maybe that is a reflex save.

**[01:03:33 - 01:03:34]** I feel like it's a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:36]** Constitution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:36]** Yeah.

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:37]** Sleight of hand?

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** It's a will save.

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:40]** You know what?

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:48]** If you're just going to try and the DC is higher if you're a reflex save because that is like you just being like, let me just grab it.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:52]** The DC is a little lower if it's a will save because that's you being like, this is going to hurt.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:55]** Both hands in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:57]** Wouldn't that be a fortitude save?

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:57]** What?

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:58]** Because it's physical.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** Wouldn't that be a fortitude save?

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:00]** Sure.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** Because it's going to be the physical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:01]** Yeah, that's fair.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:02]** That's fair.

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:03]** I'll take that.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:03]** Okay.

**[01:04:03 - 01:04:04]** Fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:06]** The will save is in the decision making.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** Yeah, that's true.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:08]** And he's already decided to do it.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** What is your fortitude save?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:13]** 14 on the die for a total of 21 fortitude.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:14]** 21 fortitude.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:16]** Wow.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:25]** And as he reaches in and the lava starts to burn him, he is going to spin a nanite surge and use defensive dispersal.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:25]** What does that do?

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:30]** So his nanites are going to take off five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:32]** Takes off five points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:38]** He's like, it's like lava coals, like walking on lava coals, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:39]** Yeah.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:39]** Yep.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:40]** I get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:41]** He's just doing it so quick.


## Speaker_0

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:43]** Run run run run run.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:44]** It's gonna phase him.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:46]** Not even gonna phase him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:47]** Not even gonna phase him.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:55]** Okay, you take 14 points of damage so you can subtract 5 from that.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** Whew!

**[01:04:57 - 01:05:03]** But you successfully reach both hands in, pull this computer up with the wires,

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:30]** fall back onto the ground let me move it here on the it's still sparking smoking this lava starting to drip off and just burn through the floor there wow smart that was fast that was in one round you went and pulled it back you want to do anything else with your turn laugh maniacally no that'd be my whole turn okay dr okay because there's a move and an action what do you do that's okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:30 - 01:05:59]** uh i'm gonna hit this dude with a pharmacological inhibitor oh that missed seven seven actually no wait sorry i'm forgetting to add your bonus 13 yeah 13 13 okay 13 doesn't hit probably yeah it doesn't hit flies sinks in the pool of oil does he have a melee weapon out he doesn't have a weapon out no but he he clearly has weapons on him but he doesn't have one out

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:04]** uh so i think bernice who's like right next to him is gonna just pop them real quick


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:05]** Hit him.

**[01:06:05 - 01:06:06]** Hit him.

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:06 - 01:06:07]** All right.

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** That's a 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:10]** That is a 14.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:11]** Also doesn't hit.

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** What?

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:16]** She thinks she has him and it just pierces a hole right through the suit.

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:20]** And for a second, maybe you can see he's pretty gone.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:23]** Like he has not eaten well in days.

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:27]** Suit is loose fitting, but that was close.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:27]** It was close.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:29]** Colin, what do you do?

**[01:06:29 - 01:06:30]** Door is open.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:31]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:36]** So I don't know if this is like a perception check.

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** I mean, one, I can't see him.

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** So I'm going to move out of the door.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:42]** Like he seems like he's pretty shaken up.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:45]** Like he's not, he's not fighting us.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:47]** He's worried about Nick's dying.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:51]** So like, I think Colin is going to try to deescalate the situation.

**[01:06:51 - 01:06:53]** Just be like enough, enough bloodshed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:59 - 01:07:00]** And that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:23]** um oh he's thinking he's thinking the man's thinking yeah he he turns to cairo and says we we mean you no further harm what is it we need from each other that's that's his turn that is his turn okay trying to de-escalate the situation see what trying to de-escalate

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:47]** we mean you no harm what can we take the man's offer here you know what further harm further harm yeah because we did kind of a little bit you did you did and and killed his girlfriend or sister or here she is real tight she came with a mind thrust man did you say for a whole time


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:51 - 01:08:12]** cool uh here's what do you do well here's is gonna second what colin says he's like we really didn't want to do it and we don't want any more destruction or death so let's just talk

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:16]** Mmm.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:17]** Mmm.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:21]** And... Two de-escalation attempts.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:21]** Oh, wait.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:22]** No, never mind.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:23]** He's just going to do that because I can't do this other thing.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:24]** Never mind.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** Go ahead.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:27]** The rules, man.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:28]** I'm reading ahead.


## Speaker_0

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:31]** Wait, what all did you do just now?

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:32]** You just said something?

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:33]** Diplomacy.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:34]** You can't do something else?

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:36]** Well, I had to... Oh, because, yeah, I guess it's not an intimidation check.

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:37]** You can move.

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:40]** So, like, it's a standard action to ready an action.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:46]** So, basically, what he would like to do is, like, if this mother trucker goes for anyone, he wants to have his magic missiles hit him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:51]** So... If he attacks anybody, then you will cast your magic missiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:51 - 01:08:54]** Makes sense.


## Speaker_0

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:54 - 01:09:00]** okay okay i did not technically roll and then yeah so all right cool that's what he's gonna do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:01]** Yeah, that's fair.

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:04]** Two escalation attempts from Colin.

**[01:09:05 - 01:09:07]** De-escalation.

**[01:09:07 - 01:09:08]** De-escalation, thank you.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:13]** Dr. Okay and Bernie's putting on the heat, so to speak.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:15]** Trying to let him know that you are capable.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:16]** Deadly.

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:23]** And Rick is taking a siesta with this sparking, burning computer core.

**[01:09:23 - 01:09:24]** May have saved it.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:40]** staying in his lane capable Dudley does his face skincare routine every day it's the top of round five Cairo looks down at this woman

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:42]** And I'll say this.

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:45]** He goes, Nix, my sweet Nix.

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:52]** And then he looks up at all of you with just this fire in his eyes that feels hotter than the land that you're in now.

**[01:09:53 - 01:09:58]** And he says, one day you will pay all of you.

**[01:09:58 - 01:10:01]** And then he just uses the run action.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:06]** And you think for a second that he's going for the car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:09]** No, I should have been more general.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:12 - 01:10:22]** I'm thinking about this suit he has on and the general landscape of Varos.

**[01:10:24 - 01:10:27]** How long he might survive running.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:29]** That's a good thought.

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:38]** But he just runs, leaps, kind of slides, pushes around the car.

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:42]** and just begins to run off in the distance.

**[01:10:43 - 01:10:46]** He can move four times his speed.

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:47]** That's the run action.

**[01:10:47 - 01:10:48]** That's over 100 feet.

**[01:10:49 - 01:10:53]** Runs off into the distance.

**[01:10:53 - 01:10:54]** And that's our game.

**[01:10:54 - 01:10:55]** Creepy man.

**[01:10:56 - 01:10:57]** Vaulting over cars.

**[01:10:58 - 01:10:59]** What's on that computer?

**[01:11:00 - 01:11:02]** What's up with her?

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:03]** Why was she trying to control you?

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:05]** Find out next time.

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:06]** We'll see you in the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:07]** Who knows?

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:08]** Thanks, everyone.
