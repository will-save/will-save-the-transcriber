**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** I spent a lot of money to smell good.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:51]** Thanks, man.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:52]** That's good.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** That's good.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** I also like my... I take showers regularly.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:56]** Colognes.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:57]** Yeah.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** I shower, too.

**[00:01:59 - 00:01:59]** That's funny.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:01]** But I wash my hair only twice a week.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** That's the secret.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:04]** Yeah.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** It's important.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** Question.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** That's how you keep the curls luscious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:16]** I was getting ready for today's sesh, and I was like, which D20 should I use?

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:20]** So I just, you know, went and rolled a couple.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:28]** just to see, it's chance, but I was like, let me just like roll a couple just to see, are they gonna roll well for me today or not?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** And then I was like, this is dumb, but also I want to do it.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** And a couple rolled poorly.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:34]** And I was like, all right, well, you know, I'm not gonna use you.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:37]** And I thought about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:39]** You should use those ones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:42]** That's the opposite of the point again.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:46]** But I realized that I tend to do that kind of a lot.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** I was like, oh, I didn't know that.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** I was like, I think I do that almost every time.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** Then I was thinking like, what?

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:56]** like little rituals do you all do in your day?

**[00:02:56 - 00:03:01]** Like, do you find that you're like, Oh, like I, I always wipe my feet five times when I'm coming in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:06]** You know, I always like make sure that our OCD, you're talking about like what are signs of OCD?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** No, no, no, no, not signs of OCD.

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:11]** What are just like weird little things that you find yourself five times?

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Very sign of OCD.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** It can be, but that's what I was asking.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:18]** I was just asking if there are there things that you all do in your day?

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:20]** That's like, Oh yeah, I tend to find myself, uh,

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:26]** doing this like i always pour my milk before my coffee things like that i mean yeah sure yeah

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:29]** I agree, but not that specific question, Kevin.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** Stop focusing on my example.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:30]** I disagree.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:38]** The satisfaction of watching the cream bloom is really nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:41]** I'll just come back.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:47]** Are you some sort of person who doesn't steam their milk before putting it in their espresso?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:49]** I use creamer because I do a pot of coffee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:51]** I do iced coffee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:57]** So I pour the creamer in and then I pour the hot coffee in and drink it immediately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:57]** Nice.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** You got to steam your milk and throw it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** I'm not going to try to steam my milk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Steamed milk is really good.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:06]** If I steam milk, I would put it in afterwards for sure.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** You're not making a macchiato.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** Come on.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:12]** But I'm making an iced coffee.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:16]** Does anyone have any other weird little rituals?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:22]** I always wake up in the morning, put on my paints, and then go take my vitamins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:23]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Is that a ritual?

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** Is that enough of a ritual?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** Yeah.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** That's a thing.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:31]** I'm pantsless when I take my vitamins usually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:34]** I usually have my pants on pretty early in the morning.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** And then your underwear on top of the pants.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:36]** Right.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** Like Captain's pants.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:39]** Or like Quillman.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:39]** Quillman, yeah.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** Yeah, Quillman, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:41]** Okay.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** Put my belt around my head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** You have to look like Quillman in order to take your vitamins.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** And then I immediately take that off and become Captain's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:54]** That's what the vitamins are for, to make you more quail-ish, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** Yeah.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** To quail the quail.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** I'm not sure where this is going.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** Anyways.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:02]** No, I don't really think I have a true ritual that helps me with my day.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:07]** I probably should have more rituals that help me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:08]** I...

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:34]** i will typically in a normal morning i will get out of bed i it's a normal morning route i guess i'll get out of bed i will go to the bathroom and then put pants on crucially and then go outside water my plants while my coffee brews and then i'll open the fridge i'll grab my i've been eating greek yogurt with fruit on the bottom yeah

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:46]** i'll grab that i'll use a spoon stir it up eat my yogurt cup toss it and i will use that same spoon to stir the cream in my coffee and then i go to work okay

**[00:05:47 - 00:06:17]** no shirt sometimes shirt depends on how early my first meeting is I might wait an hour or two to put a shirt on that's fair if I'm slammed for work I'll actually sleep with my laptop next to my bed and just like spend the first couple of hours like not even get out of bed just lay there in my underpants hacking away because when you work from home you can do that I haven't joined a client call without pants on yet


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** But you're always on video though.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Yes.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** I am always on video.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:24]** I also, even if I'm not on video, usually always have pants on for a call.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** I don't know what it is.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:29]** Maybe it's the risk that I will click the video button and I'm standing up.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** It's a fear.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** You know?

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:31]** Yeah.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:33]** Yeah.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:39]** I will say every time I get in bed and like there, there's times when you get in bed to like watch TV and do other things.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:41]** And there's times when you get in bed to go to sleep.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:44]** When I get in bed to go to sleep, I always rub my feet together.

**[00:06:44 - 00:07:01]** oh like a cricket yeah yeah do you make a little sound do you like a little music just a little yeah it's like the the church yeah the thing is pinocchio or something i don't know yeah

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:21]** yeah it's that and i always have to have something in my life it's actually really bothering me now because i can't find it oh it's like q that i fidget with all the time and i've lost it and i'm like not freaking out but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:29]** I'm uncomfortable, but I'm, I'm feeling the, the urge to find it right now at this, at this moment.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:29]** Okay.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** That's fair.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:30]** That's fair.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** Thank you for sharing that.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** That's good.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:34]** It's a good morning.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:34]** Yeah.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:34]** Yeah.

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:35]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:36]** Yeah.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:36]** Kelly.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:39]** Well, I like, I like that you can make music with your legs.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:46]** I feel like if your kids are like really annoying and they want something from you and they're crying, you can just be like, Oh, let me just play you the smallest violin.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:48]** You just rub your legs together.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:49]** Yeah.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** I think that's pretty good.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:53]** How did it go so long and I didn't know that you could do that?

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** Show us right now.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Take your pants off.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** He's like a freaking renaissance man here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:00]** Yeah, take your pants off and demonstrate for us now, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:04]** While you're gritting, do you actually play music with your legs as well?

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:08]** Because I guess you're really good at gritting, which I still haven't seen.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** You got to demonstrate it someday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** I will.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:15]** The next time we're all together, we'll find the occasion to gritty.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:15]** Yes.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:16]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:17]** Good.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:18]** All right, good.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:21]** I will learn to gritty just so I can join you.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:24]** And you'll look better than me, but I will learn.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** But I can't make music with my legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** I won't be able to learn how to gritty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** I will try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** I will try.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** That will be what we'll do.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:36]** Well, since I'm talking, I guess I'll go.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:41]** So right now, I like to listen to... There's things that I like to watch.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:45]** They're not quite like ASMR, but relaxing videos on YouTube to help me go to sleep.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** Recently, I've been watching The Roam.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** HBO series.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:49]** Yeah.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** From like the early 2000s.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:51]** Yeah.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:52]** Yeah.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** Just excerpts from that over and over.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** Like all the Game of Thrones actors in it.

**[00:08:56 - 00:09:08]** And then like, but like, yeah, it will be like a clip of like, you know, being like, like Caesar bribing someone and the guy, the senator will be like, my wife has very expensive tastes like that.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:11]** And I'm like, oh, it's so relaxing to me for some reason.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** And that puts me to sleep.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** So that's my ritual.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:16]** I like to hear about senatorial drama.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** That's what I relate to.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:20]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:23]** It's very soothing to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:23]** That's funny.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** Will?

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:29]** I mean, rituals change so much over time.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:32]** It's really hard to pinpoint one down.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** I mean, when you're as old as you are.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:35]** Yeah.

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:40]** So, you know, sometimes I crack open, you know, like,

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:49]** keys of Enoch or like Golden Dawn rituals and I just perform them in the nude in my kitchen.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** As one does.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:52]** You know?

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:58]** Pointing to the east and to the west and drawing, you know, symbols.

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:01]** Yelling words and spirits and stuff.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** Your neighbors love you.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:05]** Yeah, I mean... 6am.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** Yeah, usually... Golden Dawn people are weird.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** Yeah.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:11]** You know.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** Screaming at the top of my lungs.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** Bellissima!

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** Tutatis!

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** Sirona!

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** Serenunos.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** I don't know.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:25]** That's... Order opto.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:25]** Okay.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** Solid.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** I like it.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** Your neighbors must love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** They really love that.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:37]** I mean, my cats are, you know, fine with it, but... What do they know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:39]** What do they know?

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** Kelly, do we have any shoutouts this week?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:48]** Uh, well, I guess, I guess I should shout out someone if you're going to be saying stuff like that.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** Fine.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:52]** I guess we'll shout out Z. Z?

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:53]** Yeah.

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:53]** Yeah.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** Z, uh, you've been like, um, she has a lot of nicknames.

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:03]** She's like Mama Z. There's like all kinds of good nicknames, but she apparently is like doing some really cool stuff at her job.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** Yeah.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:28]** Well, it's with that that I want to get back to the combat at hand.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:31]** The eight round combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** I think that we'd like to get out of the combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:38]** I want to get back to the combat.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:43]** And this is definitely a, this is a, it's a tough moment.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:51]** You guys are in combat now for the first time really since the combat at the monitoring station.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** Yeah, pretty much to call us.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:55]** I mean, that was a, that was a tough one.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:59]** Is this tougher than that or the same?

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:02]** It feels about the same.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** About the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** Yeah, it feels tougher.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:09]** I think it's because we're not using as good tactics as we did that time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:12]** Yeah.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:16]** Well, I thought that the attempt at the door closing and opening, I thought that was like a good idea.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** And it worked for a bit, so.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:28]** For some reason, the escape from Tyrcallus seemed like it was more, the stakes were higher for some reason for me personally.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:32]** But maybe that's just because I've been doing nothing except rolling on the floor on my own vomit, so I'm not really sure.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** Like, I don't know what's going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** Well, you guys can all run away because Rick's going to be fine.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** They want him alive.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:43]** Well, we'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** That's what you think.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:48]** So, I mean, the stakes also were a lot higher.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:52]** You were getting out of Tercalus when it was after so much time.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:55]** Yeah, it was like your chance to finally escape.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** You're finally on your own.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:58]** You're on your own now, for sure.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** So, I get it.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** We're back on the map.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** We're going back.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:09]** It is round eight right now.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** I'm going to bring up the battle music again.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:22]** We ended last time with... There was a lot of movement from you all trying to corral them, use the doors as tactics.

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:28]** They decided to move into one side of the hallway and just start firing like fish in a barrel down the hallway.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** And that is where we're going to start.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:36]** Brick had aimed a gun at Rick 19 and then pointed it at Colin.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:51]** Colin, that is a natural 19 on the die to hit you for, for a total of 28.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:51]** Nope.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:58]** 32, 33.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:02]** Huh.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:02]** Huh.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:04]** I don't know if that hits.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:07]** I mean, we don't know if that hits.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:08]** Roll your mischance.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** Oh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:13]** Nice retort there.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:19]** A little truchet on that one to borrow from somebody from another show.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:19]** That's a 41.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:20]** They're good to go.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:21]** They're good to go.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:22]** Firing at you.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** That's five points of damage.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:24]** Where are you?

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:27]** Are you in hit points like Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:30]** I have just arrived at hit point land.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:54]** at hit point land welcome to hit point land okay they took a step over aimed at you it is like shooting fish in a barrel or four of you or there are four of them and they are looking down the hall rick and here's cannot uh cannot do anything except take a single move action for the next two rounds dr k and the android are at the back and colin you're at the front of the line

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** It is the top of the round.

**[00:15:56 - 00:16:08]** Dr. K and the android, the goo beneath you starts to really just become water and just start to loosen up pretty quickly.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** So you're good to go.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:11]** That's no longer difficult terrain beneath you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:17]** Things... Something needs to break here.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** This is a big wave coming at y'all.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:23]** It's top of round nine, I feel like.

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:27]** The Wetzel's going to take a strike at you, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:37]** Colin, that's a critical hit from the Wetzel.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:38]** Oh, my God.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** Is there a mischance?

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:44]** Against melee attacks?

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:48]** Because he's going through the... That should be a mischance, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:50]** Okay.

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Let's hope.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:53]** No.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:55]** That is a 50 on the die.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** I am sorry about this, Colin.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:03]** That is 22 points of damage.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:05]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:07]** Oh no.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** Where's Rudy?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:12]** 22 points of damage.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** What are you at, dog?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** I'm at not good.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:23]** He's at not good, and you are critically bleeding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** What does that mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:29]** You gain the bleeding condition.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** Cool.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** Yeah.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** Yeah, man.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** Something needs to break here.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:35]** This is a lot.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** This is a lot.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:37]** Bleeding.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:41]** You take the listed amount of damage at the beginning of your turn each round until this condition ends.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** It's 1d4.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:50]** Your bleeding can be stopped with a successful DC 15 medicine check as a standard action or through the application of any ability that restores hit points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:50]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:55]** I feel like Dr. Okay is healing serums.

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:58]** I feel like there are other things that can happen here.

**[00:17:59 - 00:17:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:02]** Healing serums don't heal stamina.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** He said, right.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:07]** But unless if you heal hit points, he is no longer bleeding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:10]** So like Colin is literally a doctor.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** He's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:12]** Yeah.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:15]** Who's not fine?

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:15]** Cool.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:17]** Rick19, it's your turn.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:20]** You are recently a new member of Hit Point Land.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** Uh-huh.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** It's a tough fight.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:22]** It's a tough fight.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:25]** He's going to tell Colin, pull back.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:29]** And then, like, in between, vomit.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:40]** And then he is going to step back and he's actually going to step into the room where the android was.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** And up around the corner inside that room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** And cough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:50]** You just hear him cough.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:50]** Yeah.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** All right.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** That's one round.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** Okay.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** Pull back.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:03]** Leaves Colin as the only viable target in range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** Colin, Colin, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:12]** Okay.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:17]** Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** What's going to happen here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:25]** I know what's going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:28]** Yeah, 100%.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:33]** The android is going to step up.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:37]** She's going to drop her gun.

**[00:19:39 - 00:20:08]** step forward into the difficult terrain and the smoke or the nanite whatever and she's going to take a swing as she pulls out this hook sword she's going to take a swing at colin that's a 19 for my attack of opportunity she can uh she can take a five foot step okay so yeah so she doesn't occur thank you though

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:14]** Colin, that is a 26 against KAC.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** That hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:17]** Roll a mischance, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:19]** Even standing in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** She's in it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:22]** Yeah.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:23]** It's a 66.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:29]** Oh, Colin, that is eight points of damage from this hook sword.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** What is the missed chance?

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:32]** It's 10.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:32]** 10%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** 10 or less.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:34]** Oh, cool.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** I thought it was 50.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** I was super confused.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** No, it's only 10%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** Yeah.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** You're like, I feel like you keep missing.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:40]** It's kind of weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:41]** Yeah.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:43]** Odd there, buddy.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:43]** Strange.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** Cool.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:44]** What?

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:47]** I get hit by a stick or something?

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:50]** You get hit by a hook sword that cuts into you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** Eight points of damage.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:53]** Woof.

**[00:20:54 - 00:21:00]** Colin, and maybe here's, you see the steward Gripley move out of sight.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:23]** like back into the room back into the room yeah you see colin like swinging on his feet colin it's your turn i hope please tell me you don't have four or less hit points uh i have right i have not fewer than four why

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:27]** Okay, good, because you do take bleed at the start of your turn.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:32]** You just took two points of bleed damage from the Wet Zelt's Claw.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:34]** What do you do?

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:35]** It's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:40]** If I normal move, I take two attacks of opportunity.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:46]** If I guarded step, I have to double move and can't heal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:48]** But you could get pretty far back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:50]** But I could get away.

**[00:21:50 - 00:22:01]** I think I'm going to double move into the cell with Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:03]** Okay.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** Tactics time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** But I'm going to go all the way to the back of the cell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:32]** okay all the way you go in in into the sonic shower you're like i i can see you stumbling there's like the stinky goo every everywhere your hands are up against the shower you're bleeding like and there's like a clear hand bloody hand print on the wall yeah yeah the shower probably turns on automatically so it's like i mean for flavor you're you're getting like clean you know starting to like sure yeah moisturized yeah

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:32]** Yeah.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** Refreshed in your lane.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:35]** Happy.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** Here's what do you do?

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:42]** First round of being sickened for the second time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:43]** Yeah.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** But you know what the cool thing is?

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:45]** What's this?

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** Electrovor is out.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:48]** Electrovor.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:50]** You can activate Electrovor!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:53]** You pulled it last time and now you can throw it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** You pulled it last time and he can do it now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** Or can you drop it?

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** That's a free action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:01]** Alright, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:03]** You need to activate it.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:06]** Here's activates Electropore.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** I thought it was a Pokeball.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:09]** I thought it just activated by touching the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** Electrovor comes out.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** Electrovor has the ability to fly.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:18]** So the sticky bullshit is not going to stop it.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:22]** So Electrovor ascends up where it flies towards.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:24]** Okay.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:26]** He's going to come out right in front of here.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:35]** He's well within his movement like range to get to here, which does not evoke attackers of opportunity because we're going into these squares, not out of them.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** He's going to move and he's going to

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:40]** What's up?

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:42]** So you take a five foot step forward.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:43]** I'm sorry to kill it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:47]** So Electrovor is going to move 30 feet.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** He's going to move up to here.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** He's flying.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:53]** So he's going to actually right there is perfect.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:54]** Come to think of it.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:00]** So he's going to stay right in AOO by moving into that square.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:23]** right that's not what i'm reading so then like i can't see i actually just looked that up before i did this yeah well they're moving into the square that the android can provoke right right so uh started right in front of uh rick if you want to look started right in front of

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:29]** moved five feet into a threatened square, but then left that threatened square into another threatened square.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:29]** I understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:30]** Got it.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** Because you're leaving a threatened square, that's what's happening.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** So never mind.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** I misread.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:37]** Rick, are you in that room?

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** Is that what I see?

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** Yeah, I'm in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:41]** I came out so I could see what was happening.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** Rick steps out of the room just to look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:46]** Hey, guys, what are you doing?

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:48]** I forget...

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:54]** So if you evoke an attack of opportunity, that can prevent you from attacking, right?

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** Or no, you'll just still attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:01]** It just uses the reaction to take an evoke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** She would use her reaction for the round.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** Okay, that's fine.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:13]** Electrovor is going to do that.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:17]** He's going to move there and he'll deal with whatever's going to happen to him.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:23]** So he's going to go in between Brick or right next to Brick and this saucy android.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** Saucy android.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:27]** That is a hit with the AoE.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** Okay, what's the damage?

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:31]** That is 10 points of damage.

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** That's okay.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:32]** He'll take that.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:33]** Okay.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:36]** And then he's going to do, um, this could save you going to do.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** Yeah.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:39]** Yeah.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** So he's going to do just the moment, please.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:43]** Um, electrical discharge.

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:45]** All right.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:51]** So now this has, uh, this, everything within 10 feet is going to be, so we'll see.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:51]** Wow.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:55]** It's not super, super beefy damage, but it's something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** Yeah.

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:00]** Oh, wait, I just forgot about this.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:06]** You do need to roll a reflex save for the electrical discharge because of the wet seltz ability.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:10]** The field that is around it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** The field that is around it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:19]** Yeah, it emits a field that electromagnetic field that disrupts

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** Oh, wait.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:27]** Technological devices and constructs and interferes with electrical signals such as those by comm units.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:27]** Hold on.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** Oh, but this is not a charge.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** It's a creature.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** A creature or object.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Let's see.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** A technological construct, which you are not.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:39]** When a creature activates an item with charges.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:40]** Okay.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** No, actually, I think you're fine.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** You're good.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:42]** You're good.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** It doesn't affect you.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:46]** John, they each take six points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** They each take six points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** What is the move?

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:54]** Yeah.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** It's called Electrical Discharge.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:06]** I'm gonna get there before Kevin gets on this, but basically, you can attempt a DC 13 reflex save, though, to try to halve this damage.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** To halve the damage or to not be staggered?

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** And to not be staggered.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:15]** Both.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** Okay, let's see.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:21]** Mm.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:21]** Mm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** Wet salt.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:25]** Failed.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** Android.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:28]** Failed.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Bricks.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:31]** Succeeded.

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** Guess how much HP the Android had left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** Was it six by chance?

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** Was it six?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:45]** The Android falls dead.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:48]** Well done.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:48]** Huzzah!

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:50]** That is what you needed.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:53]** You needed a break here from all this.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** But it's not out of the woods yet.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:58]** Okay, so the other two are not staggered.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** They've taken three points.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** Or no, sorry, the Wetzel is staggered, right?

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:03]** Wetzel's staggered and takes six points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Yep.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:06]** And Brick is not staggered.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:10]** The Behe guy makes sense that he pushed through that.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:13]** Yeah, no, of course he does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** He is a baller.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:15]** Well, ****.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:16]** Okay.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** That is what you needed.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:19]** You needed something to happen.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** Stagger is also not great.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:23]** Single move action or standard action, but not both and not full actions.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:24]** Yikes.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:25]** Yikes, yikes, yikes.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:26]** All right.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** One is down.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** One is down.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:31]** There is light at the end of the tunnel.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:31]** Doctor, okay.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:34]** You see the android go down.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** What do you do?

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** The hallway's starting to clear out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:39]** Yeah.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:51]** was flipping through the pages of the character operations manual and forgot that he had an ability that would help in all of this.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** Which is alleviate pain.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** Let me read it for you.

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:03]** As a standard action, you can create and deliver a formula to a living creature to prevent pain and nausea.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:13]** When injected, the mixture provides target with plus four enhancement bonus to saving throws against pain effects and effects that cause sickened or nauseated condition.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** This bonus lasts one minute.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:22]** If the target is already under one of those effects or it has already has the sickened or nauseated condition,

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:30]** It can immediately attempt a new saving throw with a plus two enhancement bonus to end the effect.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** Wow.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** This is important.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** This is important stuff.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** We knew Dr. Okay.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:35]** Yeah.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:36]** I forgot.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:37]** Of course.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:38]** Sorry, guys.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** I'm sick.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** It's all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:40]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:42]** It's all good, but it's...

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:48]** So Dr. Okay is going to walk up to here's and give him a serum as a standard action.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:50]** And that's all I can do in this round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:52]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** But you can now roll a new saving throw.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:56]** And for the next minute,

**[00:29:56 - 00:30:02]** So like six rounds, you can attempt a new saving throw to alleviate the condition, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** Do you attempt it?

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:06]** I would think they would attempt it on their turn, right?

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:08]** It says as soon as it's delivered.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** Oh, as soon as it's delivered.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:09]** Thank you.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** Perfect.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:12]** Give me a fortitude saving throw.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** 17.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** That's with the plus two?

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:16]** You get a plus two to it.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:18]** Oh, with plus two on top of that?

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** Then 19.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** Yes.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:30]** As soon as that breaks your Sheeran skin and hits your Sheeran bloodstream, you are... The nausea is removed.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** You are good to go.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** Here's Fabricius.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** You are no longer...

**[00:30:37 - 00:31:03]** nauseated what a relief ah what a relief you you were counting the days and you were reminding yourself of what it felt like to not be nauseated oh yeah i mean like when you're sick you can't think of anything else really i know especially when you're nauseous come on you really can't um you can't yeah well done yeah during this time bernice is going to try and one two three

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:23]** and then open the door to oh i guess this is locked yeah so you go to open the door of the other bathroom back in the uh barracks bedroom that door is locked the lower door the one that was already open no there there was one that was already opened and then there was another one there oh okay there there there were three doors along that north wall


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:24]** Okay.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:33]** Well, she's gonna... Seeing that the door's locked, she's gonna start moving back to the other door for the rest of her movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:34]** Copy.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:35]** Okay.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Got it.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:37]** Okay.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** Things are starting to change a little bit.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** Here's is up.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:45]** One of the stewards is down.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:53]** The android behind you, Dr. Okay, steps up and is going to shoot at...

**[00:31:54 - 00:32:00]** Brick will have soft cover that is not going to work.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:06]** flies off in the direction of where the other steward would have been.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:09]** And it is Brick's turn.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** Brick drops the gun.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:15]** Oh, can only do a single... No, that was the wet salt.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:29]** Okay, Brick is going to drop the gun and start to move forward into the space, stepping right on the body of the dead steward.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:42]** pulls out a hook sword, takes that guarded step or that five foot step to not incur an AOO, and then is going to swing at the Electrovor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** Sorry, slow down.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:46]** He moved and then took a guarded step and then swung?

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:49]** No, he just took a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** Just took a guarded step.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:52]** Pulls out, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:54]** So that whole movement you just talked about was a guarded step.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:55]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** Again, I can't see the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:58]** Yeah, it's all good.

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:00]** But I know you're still checking the rules nonetheless.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:05]** They probably has to roll the mischance.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:07]** Oh, close.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** That was a 19.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** Almost there.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** Almost there.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:13]** That's a 14 against Electrovor.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:15]** Does that hit, Kelly?

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** Oh, just a moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Against KSE.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** Yeah, just a second, please.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:20]** That does not hit.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** That does not hit.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:22]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:26]** Oh, that doesn't hit.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:26]** All right.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** All right.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** Enjoy your moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** Yeah.

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** Okay.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:30]** Love it.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:36]** The wet cell is annoyed that brick is in the way.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** Can only take a move or a standard.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:46]** Um, I think the wet cell is going to kind of step around and move up to.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:46]** Ooh.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:48]** Ooh.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** It's going to take a move action.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:55]** It's going to move 5, 10, 15, 20.

**[00:33:59 - 00:33:59]** Let's see.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:03]** Would it move in to the room with Rick and Colin?

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** Oh, that'd be devious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:10]** Can it move 20 if it's all in one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:10]** What's up?

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** I don't think it can move that far, too.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:16]** It would have to move through an enemy square to get into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** True, true.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** It would have to incur an AOL.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:19]** It can move 40 feet.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:23]** It can move 40 feet on normal terrain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:44]** right so if i move five that's ten then that's 20 to move into a threatened square from here's then it would incur an ao to move if here's had an melee weapon out and would move into the thing and that would be 30 feet not out yeah i didn't think so the question is would it do it

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:47]** I'm actually going to roll an intelligence check for this creature.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:49]** Because it's such a unique creature.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:52]** Is it dumb by chance?

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:57]** Well, it used to be a reptoid.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:57]** And then now it's not.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:58]** Right?

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:01]** And so it's been genetically altered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Does Electrovor not get an AOL?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** Does Electrovor get an AOL, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** It has Slam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:11]** I don't know if it ever really talks about that.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:13]** Is there just an assumption about...

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:29]** i mean yeah natural weapons it does it does happen then it would yeah it does yeah so uh give me a moment okay movement right there it wouldn't just stop the movement but you would definitely get hit right

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:38]** Okay, so he's going to do that Electrovor scene, this creature that he's like, what the f*** is that?

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** It's terrifyingly hideous.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:46]** He's going to like, he takes a moment, shakes his head, his little scaly head, and then he's going to tail slap it.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:50]** So he does like a forward somersault at just a moment.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** Yeah.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:54]** I'm going to roll my dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:58]** So drones do not get a reaction until level 20.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:59 - 00:35:59]** Huh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:24]** that's a true right i don't know how that applies to well we can figure that out later here's what do you uh what do you get what's your attack roll oh all right so yeah he uh electrovore does a five damage says tail slap no no no no no no no no so tail slap plus nine it's your attack roll and then add nine so roll d20 add nine


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** You still have to roll to attack.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:28]** I see.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:28]** I see.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:29]** I see.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** I see.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** Give me a moment.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** That makes sense.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:34]** It's been a while.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** I've been casting spells.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:37]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:39]** You literally haven't attacked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:40]** 15 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** 15 does not hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** And it moves through.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:46]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** And it moves through.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:51]** John, would you ping for me which square this guy started in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** Started here.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:53]** Okay.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** Started ping there.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:57]** So my thought would be...

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:18]** diagonal down oh 10 so it has 40 feet so it would move into the square which is 5 feet got it and then it'll move down that's 10 that's 25 or sorry it's 15 then move down again that's 35 then it can move 5 feet oh no it can't move fully in right unless it can move diagonally around the door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** It technically, yeah, can move.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:23]** So the first one would be 10 and then the second one would be 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:26]** But moving diagonally is double the distance, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:29]** No, because it's moving into the space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:33]** But the second diagonal move in a row is twice as much.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:37]** So it would be, is that four times as much or is it just three times as much?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** Oh, I see your point.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:38]** Okay.

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** Well, it sounds like it can't get in.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:42]** It can get right to the door in front, right?

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:42]** Yes.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:42]** Yeah.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** Okay, cool.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:44]** All right.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:49]** It gets right to the door in front, ignoring the AOL from Electrovor.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** Thank you for holding me to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** Rules paralegals are on it.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:57]** Currently, it's looking like summoned creatures do not get AOLs.

**[00:37:57 - 00:38:00]** But we'll wait until the final version.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:00]** No harm, no foul.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** Yep.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** Rick19, what are you going to do?

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** You are still sickened.

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:11]** for the second round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:17]** I'm trying to figure out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:17]** Yeah.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** I don't know why you go in there.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** Just to hide.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Just to get away from the combat.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** Yeah, I got nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:29]** I think he's going to... Let's see.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** Give me one more second.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** I'll give you many seconds.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** I know.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:40]** I'm going to use my move action to move my clouded array.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** Oh, okay.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** If I can find the map again.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:52]** So the array is going to move here, here, and here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** Okay.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:58]** So you swing it around to be vertical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** Kind of just wrap around the wall back towards me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:02]** Okay, that's cool.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** Start to protect you.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:03]** I like that.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:04]** I like that.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Maybe it'll work.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** Okay.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** That's my move action, and that's my whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:24]** 19 points of damage.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** That's a standard action.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:30]** And then as a move action, I'm going to do the same on myself.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:31]** Okay.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:42]** And that converts into stamina when you hit the threshold.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** If I hit stamina, yeah.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** That's where he shines.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:27]** Yes.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** So, it's all good.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:29]** Can you take a guarded step in difficult terrain?

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** Can you take a guarded step in difficult terrain?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:33]** I don't think you can!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:39]** That would also mean that we all made that mistake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:45]** And can you take a guarded step through an enemy square?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** It wasn't through an enemy square.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:47]** Through a threatened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** Yeah.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** Well, like,

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:54]** I guess moving diagonally through between a door and into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:57]** It just took a five foot step forward into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:04]** According to Stack Exchange, difficult terrain doubles the cost of moving into terrain.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:07]** Therefore, a move is not enough to crawl into it.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:13]** Crawl move action also gives five feet of movement.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:18]** And would similarly not allow one to crawl into a square of difficult terrain.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** That's like the analogy.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** Cause it's not explicit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** Yeah.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:28]** I don't think it, there's nothing that says that you can't take a guarded step through difficult terrain though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:40]** Difficult terrain says, such as heavy undergrowth, piles of junk, steep stairs, hampers, each move into a square of difficult terrain counts as two squares of movement.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:46]** Each diagonal move in a difficult terrain square costs three squares.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** Okay, great.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** You can't run or charge.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:49]** Yep.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:53]** If you occupy multiple squares, you can only move fast at the most difficult.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:56]** Yeah, there's nothing that says that you can't take a guarded step in there.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** Yep.

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** And it just moves straight.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:00]** So it moved right in.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** Who does it attack?

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** One through three, it attacks Colin.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** Four through six, it attacks Rick.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:07]** That is a six.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** Rick, it's gonna swing at you.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** Gonna swing at you, Rick.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** Gonna swing at you.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:16]** That's a 19 against KAC, which I don't think hits.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** All right.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:18]** Does not.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** That does not hit.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** It's not looking great.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** It's not looking great.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** Rick, what do you do?

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:25]** It's your turn.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** This thing tried to swing at you.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** Missed.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** You're in the corner.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:31]** Oh, wait, I'm going to let this Wetzel put you in the corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:34]** I'll take the chance to do a full tech.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** Okay.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** Oh, God.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** Full attack.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:39]** Not used to this table.

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:45]** That's a ten plus four for 14.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:47]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:50]** What's the rule for moving?

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:57]** Guarded step says that you can move five feet as a move action, right?

**[00:50:57 - 00:51:00]** But you can't move five feet in difficult terrain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:04]** Because it costs two.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:06]** It's the cost of two squares.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** Right.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:12]** But if the squares are not five feet, if it's a template square, it will cost more.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:16]** Yeah, I don't... I do hear you.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:19]** I don't know that that...

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:28]** I could do that, but then I'm setting the precedent that you all, now you all cannot take a guard to step in difficult terrain, which I don't think is fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:34]** And I think it's something we've already done in this combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:35]** We have.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** Yeah, I think we've all done it.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:42]** It just doesn't make sense to me that the point of a guarded step is for you to move through it.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:47]** So I feel like the spirit of the rule supersedes the technicality, because I feel like it's not quite a one-to-one.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** I do hear you will, though.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:52]** It doesn't make sense in your brain that you can only move five feet with a guarded step.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:55]** Difficult terrain means that you move double of whatever it is.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:58]** But I also feel like the spirit is that it takes more movement.

**[00:51:58 - 00:51:59]** to move through it.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:05]** And the fact that a guarded step is already limited to five feet anyway, it's not like I'm saying guarded step and then keep moving.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** It's like, I can only move five feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:09]** I can't guard that twice.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:09]** Five feet.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** And I'm like, you can't move.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:16]** You can't expend five feet of movement in difficult terrain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:39]** is the problem i am having but i say i think it's to the discord yeah that's fine and yeah yeah that's fine and i think it's more like i like if i'm counting down from the what's else movement i've moved 10 feet even in the guarded step i've taken like it costs five feet but i've actually like it it will deduct 10 from the movement that i've done


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:48]** And like spirit of the movement, I would I would actually argue that like a guarded step is a careful movement to avoid combat.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:52]** But at the same time, that could also be used to overcome difficult terrain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:58]** Because you're expending a full move action in order to just move five feet.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:01]** So I think that kind of... We'll see what the Discord says.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:02]** Cool.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:04]** All right, Rick, what are you doing?

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** You're going to full attack.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** I did full attack.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:10]** My first hit or first attack was a 14.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** That's probably a miss.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:12]** Yeah, it's a miss.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:16]** The second one is 19 plus four for 23 to hit.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** That's a hit.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:18]** Nice.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** Okay, so that one hit.

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** So it was worth it.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:24]** And that's going to be a D12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** Gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:31]** That's only a two on the die for a total of 10 slashing hits.

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:32]** 10 slashing damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:35]** Ooh, this thing is looking real bloody.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:36]** Real bloody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** Rick's finally feeling a little bit better.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:51]** Sees this thing walk in the room, and he kind of, like, picks his axe up, upward cutting and misses, and then puts it, kind of, like, steady hands it, swings back down, and slices this thing across the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Okay.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:54]** Ooh, you cut a deep gash in his face.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:57]** It is not looking great in the slightest at all whatsoever.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** Okay.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** Okay.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Getting in the middle of the round here.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:04]** The Gripley steps out.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:10]** sees Bernice in front, Dr. Okay, and the android to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:13]** Did you take a garden step?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:18]** No, but he moved into a threatened square, right?

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** Yeah, I don't think that you're doing that.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:27]** But... It has a...

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:29]** Hooksword out.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:35]** It is going to step up to you, Dr. Okay, in which you do get an AOL.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** It's going to risk it for the biscuit.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:46]** And you can tell that as it starts coming towards you, its face is like the anger in its face is starting to move some of the features of the Gripley.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** Give me the roll on the AOL.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** Creepy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** Well, it's nothing.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Gripley.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:58]** That's a 19 on the.

**[00:54:59 - 00:54:59]** Oh.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** Oh, my God.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:06]** For 23, that is a hit with the apprehension class.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** Hey, watch out.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:07]** Watch out.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** I'm going to hit you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** Taste of your own medicine.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:09]** How's that?

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:10]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:13]** That is 11 points of damage.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:15]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** More than that.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:17]** Sorry.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:22]** 16 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:26]** 16 points of damage as you swing and hit the Gripley.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:30]** The Gripley falls to the ground dead.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:33]** You have taken out the Gripley.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:36]** You have taken out the Android.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** The tide has definitely turned here.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** You all are... Yeah.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:41]** Wow.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:42]** Colin?

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** Yeah.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:46]** What else do you want to do with your... Well, that was its turn.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:48]** Colin, what do you do with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:54]** For clarification, where is Rick in this room?

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:54]** On a bed.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** Got it.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:56]** Cool.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** In mine, you're right in front of the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:23]** think that's why i was so confused about the wet salts movement so the the rooms are four uh two by two i see you in the bottom left corner i'm in i'm like kitty corner from you top right top right got it the wet soul is his bottom right to the bottom right awesome um i'm gonna stab the it out of this wet salt yeah i'm gonna do i'm gonna do a full attack i'm gonna stab it twice


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:24]** Okay.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:25]** Okay.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:25]** Here we go.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** First stab.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** He rears.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** First stab.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:29]** First stab.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:31]** Rears back with a survival knife and just.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:36]** That's a 10 on the die for a 14.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:36]** 14 miss.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:38]** 14 misses.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:45]** The second stab of the survival knife is a 16 for a dirty 20.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:46]** That is a hit.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** Sounds promising.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:48]** That's a hit.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** So he's calling.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:53]** He just like javelins it right into the face of this wet salt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:54 - 00:57:08]** four two plus two four stab damage four stab damage and it is looking real close to dead here let's take it down

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** Let's take it down.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:16]** You're in the shower, you're like feeling better, but you're like, you are down to your last weapon, just trying to take this thing down.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** Here's, what do you do?

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** There's two left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:29]** Having previously snapped his right finger, snaps his left, and three more missiles come out for, just as before, 15 total damage.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** Against who?

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:31]** And he's going to do this at Brick.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:31]** Brick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:32]** Against Brick.

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:33]** Okay.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** Hits Brick.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:37]** Brick is still up, but almost dead.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** What the fuck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** All right.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:53]** Electrovor is going to do a... He's going to spend his final resolve before he goes to sleep to do another electrical discharge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:54]** Okay.

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:56]** And I need to roll a thing?

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** You need to roll a third.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** Yeah, no, no, that's correct.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** Yeah, five.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:20]** Two damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:21]** Two damage.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** What the heck, man?

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:24]** Dang.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:28]** And then Electrovor falls into his... Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:30]** Bye.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:33]** Disappears.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** See you soon, Electrovor.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:35]** Dr.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** O.K., what do you do?

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** You've taken out the Grip Lee.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:42]** Sounds like things might be in hand here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** Yeah, so Dr. O.K.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:46]** is going to walk up through the sticky stuff.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:48]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:56]** And if I do a full attack, I can attack both the Ripley and Brett.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:57]** Go for it.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:57]** Go for it.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:58]** Why not?

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** Why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** Are you guarded stepping?

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:05]** Because the Ripley has... The Ripley has reach as well.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** Oh, it's dead.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:06]** Okay.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:07]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:08]** This dude's dead.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** I missed that.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:10]** Yeah.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** So, yeah.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:18]** And I think I get a plus two to my attack because now we're flanking it on this first...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** Oh, you are on the wet salt?

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** Yes, you are.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** Yes.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** The tactics are coming through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:32]** That is a 17 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:34]** 17 to hit the wet salt?

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:35]** Yeah.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** On the first attack.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** On the first attack.

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:40]** That's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** I'm typing it now.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** Dr. Ok kills the wet salt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:45]** Yeah.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:47]** How much damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:54]** That's 13 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:56]** How do you kill the Wetzel?

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:57]** Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:04]** I would assume that the Aberrant Henshin class has a loop, and it just garrotes.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:10]** It loops around his neck, and I would assume he just falls lifeless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** Oh, man.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:18]** It was snapping at Colin and trying to hit Rick, and then just comes out of nowhere.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** Amazing.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:21]** The Wetzel is dead.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:24]** What is the second attack on the brick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:26]** Can you take out the brick?

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:30]** Okay, so does a 15 hit the brick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:32]** Does a 15 hit the brick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** It's minus 4, right?

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:35]** And 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:37]** For a full attack, a 15 does not hit the brick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** Okay, so I miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:41]** I miss.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:42]** What does Bernice do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:45]** Save the day?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** We'll see.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** Come at the last second?

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** Just take a shot?

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** She can't do anything.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:51]** She's just going to move out to the hallway.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** Oh, okay.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:53]** She can't take a shot?

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:54]** Yeah.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:56]** She can only do one or the other.

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:57]** Okay.

**[01:00:58 - 01:01:01]** If I did a, you know, because I moved and attacked.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:02]** Got it.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:02]** Yep.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:02]** Copy.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:03]** Copy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** Wait, so what did you just roll against?

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:05]** Brick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:10]** I rolled a 19, but I did a full attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** Yeah.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:13]** Oh, you moved and then did a full attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:13]** Yeah.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:42]** yes because net was flanking i get a plus two so it was kind of like you can't move and oh but it's a full yeah that's fine the full attack is a part you give up a movement to do the full time yeah yeah we didn't catch it so you would yeah you didn't hit break anyways but you wouldn't have been able to all right so i just did a attack it's fine yeah no but that's that's still fun you did a hell of an attack yeah because you took out the friggin wet salt effecta looks over sees brick and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:42 - 01:02:05]** takes a shot thinking it's a final shot and it swings wide brick has one more turn before presumably for what for we to attack oh before he dies yeah i think brick walks up to dr okay and just takes one more swing unless you all miss again

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:31]** brick takes one more swing dr okay that is a 26 to hit i want this dr okay that is an attack of opportunity takes a guarded step okay yeah that is 10 points of damage dr okay to your stamina as this bloodied creature also just angry but confident like their confidence has not been shaken this whole time even when they are on death's door


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:43]** they are sorry to take the garden step thing actually that paralegals got back to us uh it says that you can't move uh or use a garden step through difficult terrain without nimble moves


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** Okay, sounds good.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:49]** Dr. K, you get an AOO on Brick, who took a step that cannot be a guarded step.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:54]** Let it be forever known that you all also cannot take a guarded step in difficult terrain.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:58]** Dr. K, what is your AOO as he steps confidently towards you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:58 - 01:03:03]** I rolled a... You got to roll a 17 or higher.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:05]** Yeah, I did, I think.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:11]** I rolled a 14, and I got a plus 4 on my attack bonus, so that's an 18.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:11]** That...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:13]** That is an 18.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:14]** That is a hit.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** Roll your damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:35]** I don't take any damage either.

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:38]** You didn't take that 10 points of damage because the AOL.

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:40]** That is our game.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:42]** That is insane.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:45]** We have just wrapped a four episode combat.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:46]** That was crazy.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]** That was loud, but it's needed.

**[01:03:57 - 01:04:06]** yep yeah seriously thanks jmb we did it thanks finder guys i don't know if i agree with that ruling but i'll take a look i haven't looked at it wasn't the big bad

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:10]** That was a really hard fight, and it wasn't the big bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:12]** I walked away completely unscathed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:14]** Yeah, so you're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** Okay, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:17]** So it was just me and Rick that almost died.

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:17]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:19]** I would have revived you.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:22]** Yeah, with great words.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:25]** No, I have stabilized you.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:27]** I can do that.

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:29]** I would have reanimated you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:30]** Do you mean revive?

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** I said what I said.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:38]** So it looks like nimble moves.

**[01:04:38 - 01:04:41]** It literally says this feat allows you to take a guard and step in difficult terrain.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:48]** That is weird that you have to go to this feat to get the answer that you need that says that you can't do it.

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:53]** Unfortunately, this means for all of us that you cannot take a guard and step in difficult terrain.

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:55]** But that is very good to know.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** Wow, y'all.
