## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:42]** Welcome to We'll Say the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:44]** Can't have flow and be wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Well, he's excited.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** He can't have flow and be wrong.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** Wow.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** All right.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:51]** People at home don't know how choppy I've been for the last year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** Oh, my goodness.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:57]** Kevin's been a gif, which is the correct pronunciation, I think, for like a year.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:59]** And now he's no longer a gif.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:02]** I'm still convinced he's using like a 14.4 modem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** That's such a dumb name.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:07]** I just don't pronounce it for like the past 20 years.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** Finally just upgraded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** Finally upgraded.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:12]** Do you still have...

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** Hotmail?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:19]** I still have a Hotmail account, but I have started migrating to Gmail for official purposes.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:21]** So next year... Hotmail is now my spam account.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Gmail is starting to go out, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:24]** That makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:27]** It's your spam account.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:29]** Hotmail should be your spam account.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:35]** I really wonder how much money Microsoft spends on spam storage every year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:38]** About as much as the post office spends on delivering...

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** Fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:41]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** Public services, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:48]** Speaking of mispronouncing things like Jif and Gif, question.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:52]** I, the other day, heard someone say, you know, with all intents and purposes.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:59]** And I remember a time in my life when I thought that saying was, for all intensive purposes.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** Intensive, like very intensive.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:05]** For all, like, really meaningful purposes.

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:27]** hardcore purposes really hard which could also be a like that's a brand new sentence right for intensive purposes it could be that but if you're intense and have purpose intense intensive purposes if you're intense and purposes yes for your intense purposes of camping that's the that's the third phrase choose rei

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:55]** that's how we announced that we have an rei sponsorship is by this little thing yeah uh no we don't actually have an rei sponsorship uh but my question to you all was are are there any phrases that you all thought were like one way and then you found it out later and you're like oh well i didn't know that i kind of look a fool a little bit sometimes when i said songs always do that to me for a lot a lot of songs i'm like that's not what i remember


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:58]** And now I just look at the lyrics constantly.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** Like, oh, that's what they're actually saying.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** But I can't think of anything specific.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:01]** Racked up like a deuce.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** It's a classic one.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:06]** It is revved up like a deuce, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Do you know what a deuce is?

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** No.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:12]** A deuce is a 1932 hot rod.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** You're revved up like a deuce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** Revved up like a deuce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** That one I know.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** That one's actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** Like a douche.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** It does sound like douche.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:24]** But if you're revving up a 1932 car, you're probably a douche.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:24]** Wow.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:24]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** Or Cruella DeVille.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:27]** Yeah.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** There's no in-between.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:33]** Are you familiar with the Peter Gabriel song?

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:34]** No.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** Shames Without Frontiers.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** The intro is Kate Bush.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:43]** And it sounds like she's singing She's So Popular.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:48]** But it's actually like... And I can't do it because it's French.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** I'll butcher it.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:52]** But it's like...

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:56]** That's the one that shows my memory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:57]** I see it here with the lyrics.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:03]** John, I feel like this is a hard banter you chose.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:05]** I don't know.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** For Kelly, because he doesn't mess up anything.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** It's just hard.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** I'm a well-read person.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:17]** When you know the English language as well as Kelly does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:42]** uh he just laughs uh all of our new will make mistakes language uh for sure so much time i mean here's the here's my problem is i often will revert into the proto language in which the english originated and then people will just be saying you actually yeah scribe the rosetta stone because you were so tired of people being confused by your transition

**[00:05:42 - 00:06:07]** you wrote it and then yeah and then it got cracked yeah it's rough um i oh because i'm like stupidly obsessed with like where these sort of sayings anachronisms came from i will i very rarely will like mispronounce them but i do like to put them together like mix them up oh yeah but like intentionally you know we'll burn that bridge when we get there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:11]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** That's a valid statement.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:14]** That feels like a literary device thing.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** We're going to cross it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** I know another word that came across my mind.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:24]** Are you familiar with the term for a book of spells?

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** A tome?

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** No.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:29]** It's a... Sure.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** But...

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:38]** I think when I first read it the first time, I think I pronounced it Grimori.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:41]** If we're doing pronunciation, I don't know why.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** Grimori.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:42]** Go down a road.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:44]** Yeah.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:46]** Ah, Kelly has found his end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:51]** When the spell hits your eye like dark moons in the sky, that's Grimori.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** That's the title right there.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:54]** That's good.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** When dark moons hit your eye.

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** Yeah, that's good.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** It works.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:24]** yeah yeah that's good i think like uh speaking of books of spells who's who's outside our door right now that's a that's a good question i did have one other that came to mind i think kelly has something that he wants to share now he's been teeing up all episode he's he's been he's been really gassing us up be like guys this is the best banter i wish i had the best story for you right now i'm about to drop the funniest thing five minutes ago he was bashing this banter


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:29]** I mean, it is hard.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:33]** And technically, this is a deviation from the banter, technically.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:36]** But when you read things, you don't necessarily know how they're pronounced.

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** Welcome to WorldSafe.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:40]** Yeah, it's a deviation from the banter.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:43]** I think, like, hyperbole, I used to pronounce hyperbole.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** Or hyperbole or something like that.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:47]** Hyperbole?

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:47]** Hyperbole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** Hyperbole.

**[00:07:49 - 00:08:06]** that's like speed bowling or like speed like highlight mixed with actual bowling yeah yeah yeah hyper bowling yeah that's good that's good just cocaine whatever


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** Same thing.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:09]** Eamon, you want a Hyper Bowl?

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** You want a Hyper Bowl?

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:12]** Oh, for sure.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** You want a Hyper Bowl real quick?

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:18]** I did recall that in fifth grade, I was reading some book about Egypt.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:23]** And it's that time where you do the test, and then the teacher's like, all right, you can do.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** I'm like, I'm done.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:28]** And then they're like, OK, just go sit in your seat quietly and just read.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** I was like, OK.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:37]** So then I go and I grab this book about Egypt off the shelf and I'm like reading it and reading all the cool, you know, captions underneath all this stuff.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:47]** And one of them was like, they take this, it was talking about mummification and said like, you know, they, they take the, the organs, they put these in these like canopic jars.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:52]** And then they were talking about some of the shapes of some of the jars and some shapes that they were using.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** And then.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:57]** I found this word and I was like, I don't know what that means.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:02]** So I went up to the teacher during the test and I was like, excuse me, Mrs. Washington.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** No, it was Mrs. Williams.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** I was like, excuse me, Mrs. Williams.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:09]** Benny knows because he literally was there, probably.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:12]** And so then I was like, what does this word mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:16]** And she was like, you should go ask your parents.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:16]** And I was like, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:18]** And I was like, are you sure?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:21]** Because it's P-H-A-L-L-I-C.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:24]** So that seems like it's pretty clear what that is.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:26]** And she was like, you should go ask your parents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** I was like, all right, cool.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:28]** So that's how I learned the word phallic.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:33]** But in the middle of the thing, like fifth grade, I'm like, I don't know.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:33]** I don't know.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:59]** just figured i'd ask her because we were buds you know it's fine i'm gonna i'm gonna have to ask your parents how that went the next time i see them yeah yeah you should that is that sounds like a story that i want to hear likewise will your question speaking of dark moons and books of spells who is outside your door well


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:03]** Kev, I see you on Threefold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:04]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:07]** I lost my screen somehow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** Looks like you can't play.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** I think you just have to sit the episode out.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:12]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:14]** Sorry, man.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** I see him.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** I see him in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** Is he in the room with you now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** It's a new computer, guys.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:24]** Is Kev really in the room with us?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** It's kind of unclear.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** Kelly's walked away from the camera.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:27]** Things are falling apart.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** Kev's not in Foundry.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:30]** This is solid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:33]** It's going to be a great episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** I usually do it in Foundry.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** And that's our game, everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:39]** That's episode 29.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** Thanks for coming.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** Solid banter.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** There we go.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:10]** I'm not used to Safari's tab setup.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:13]** I was on a different tab with that.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** Okay, I'm on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:17]** Yay, you're good, you're good, you're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:20]** You're coming in loud and clear, which I'm so pleased to see.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:21]** Wait, what?

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:25]** I said he's coming in loud and clear, which I'm so pleased to see.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:25]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:26]** I totally agree.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** That is a miracle in and of itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:31]** I'm very happy to be here, guys.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Thank you for showing up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:34]** Are you taking notes this time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:35]** I can.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** I can take notes.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** I haven't started yet.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** That's fine.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** It's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:45]** In case anyone wondered how much of a hot mess we are, this is us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:48]** I rolled in like three minutes before recording.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:52]** The problem is the keyboard's different, so all the notes are going to be all screwed up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:55]** Yeah, Mac changes the keyboard with every release.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** Well, it's a much smaller Mac.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:59]** It's not a bug, it's a feature.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:02]** I'm going from the 15-inch to the 14-inch, and the keyboard's smaller.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** Yeah, that one inch makes all the difference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Yep, it does.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** One-inch on a keyboard's a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:06]** That's what she said.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** That's what she said.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:10]** Yep, that's what they said.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:18]** Speaking of making a big difference, last time you all made a big difference in one man's life as you killed his sister.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:19]** That got Will.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:24]** Last time we all made a big difference.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:25]** Ah.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:25]** Sister.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:28]** Well, that's a, yeah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:05]** I don't get that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:09]** Oh, because Lamar Jackson in an interview was like, oh, you guys see cars?

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** Because the way he was running, he was like Lightning McQueen.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** And everybody was like, what are you, three-year-old?

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** What are you, three-year-old?

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** Well, getting back to the recap.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:28]** No way to stand up for your sister.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:34]** This feels like the start to a limerick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:41]** You all decide to explore what is on the drive that Kev saved from this bubbling, oiling lava.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:43]** This music is a little too intense.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:47]** And you restore power.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:51]** Some of you start looking and just taking in inventory.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:59]** What is in this dome that the stewards flagged, that you flagged, and that you finally showed up to?

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:00]** What is in here?

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:06]** You know outside there's all this communications equipment that was dismantled in a hurry a while ago.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** But it's been here for a while.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** You're looking through.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:18]** You find tools, specialty tools and materials that are trademarked from Ringworks.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:24]** You start looking at the device itself.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:40]** and you're able to find that there are data that's been pulled by these two, Chiron Nix, from the communication river that's headed from Tyrcalis to Terrapin, and then out, right?

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** It's a controlled line.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:46]** You're able to find out that there are

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:52]** That they've pulled down all the data from the kind of unencrypted, right?

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:59]** The unclassified files of ship logs, general personnel logs, happenings, cleanings, things that just get sent out.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:09]** Then you also see that they have been sending a message up.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:13]** They've been trying to get out to somebody.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:14]** Desperately.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:16]** Desperately.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:47]** saying that they have passed the test saying that they are ready saying that they are ready to to to gain their entrance they are incessantly asking when they can meet again to someone that they addressed as wraith and they are referencing hex house palace obscura they've achieved their goal you do a little ip sniffing you get to seeing that this address

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:04]** that some unusual device, like not like a device that's meant to be receiving these signals.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:08]** It's like a, I think I, I think I said smart fridge, you know?

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** Yeah.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** It's like toast.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:10]** Yeah.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** It's like Silicon Valley.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:12]** Yeah.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:14]** Smart, smart toaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:15]** You all go out.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:18]** My stove texts me when it's preheated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:22]** Hey Kev.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:25]** Hot and ready for you.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** Come inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:34]** Put something inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:40]** There's a couple inches in here for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:46]** You gonna put a butt in there for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Make sure you use protection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:51]** Like foil?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:56]** Hey, man, whatever works, all right?

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:59]** Whatever works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:02]** Heat-resistant protection.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:05]** I like to double up the foil and then the parchment paper.

**[00:18:05 - 00:18:06]** That way it doesn't stick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** It keeps things clean.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** You know, that's good.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** Dr. K goes out.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:16]** You kind of have this nice moment to yourself, Dr. K. I thought about it after we recorded.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:25]** You had this moment where you kind of were just out in the cool of the Veros for evening as cool as it can be at almost 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** But you're by yourself for a second.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** And you're working on the car.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:37]** You heal, fix, repair, salvage a significant portion of the cars.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:39]** The police cruisers.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** H.P.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:41]** ?

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:45]** I meant to ask you at the time, was there anything that you were thinking?

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:49]** I think right in the first hour, you got double the work that you could.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:55]** And then I think we were saying that over the next hour, you got the normal amount of work done because you were just, you were slowing down.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** It was the end of your day.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** You just escaped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:02]** I think there's still like adrenaline rushing through Dr. Okay.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:07]** You know, initially just focused on getting out of this God forsaken place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:08]** Definitely.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** Yeah.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:13]** Any significant thoughts that you had while you were working there?

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:20]** Or were you trying to do that mindset of like, let me just get into my physical labor?

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:21]** Flow state.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** Flow state.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:23]** Like we were talking about.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:25]** Got to have a flow.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:25]** Yeah.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:25]** Okay.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:26]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** You walk in.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** While the lava's flowing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** While the lava and the oil is flowing.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** So is Dr. Okay.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:32]** That's what I'm always saying.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:37]** Your two hours before you can really get a full rest are up.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:42]** After two hours, you're ready to pass off the baton to here's Fabricius.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:46]** And you walk inside.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** Here's is sleepy.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** Doesn't want to get up.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** Classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** It's been a long day.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** I've been pushing for it and everyone's like, nah.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** That's true.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:55]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:58]** And Rick and Colin, you did some healing.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** Dr. O'Kade did some healing.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:04]** There was a collective, let's heal, get things done, and then let's go to sleep.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:06]** Right?

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:06]** Just pass out.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** It's the first rest that you've had since escaping.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** I think the last time you slept was on Tirkal's base.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:15]** And now it's a, you know, there's probably nothing left there.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:21]** Dr. O'Kade is waking up here's.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:28]** And then there's a knock, knock, knock on the door.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** What do you all do?

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:33]** I think Colin and Rick are still sleeping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:36]** Here's his still rustling awake, I guess.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:40]** How much do you, what do you need me left to do?

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:51]** And then he hears, he hears the knock and I guess he just pauses and, and looks at it and then looks his eyes, looks as well.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** This is in great English today.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:53]** He licks his eyes.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:54]** That's one of those phrases we're talking about.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:58]** Yeah, that was the phrase that I f***ed up with as a kid all the time.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** Racked up.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:00]** Looked up with his eyes.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:03]** He looked his eyes at Dr. O.K.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** just like that.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:06]** And then he looked them at the door and then back at Dr. O.K.

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:10]** He kept looking his eyes everywhere, but finally resting his eyes on Dr. O.K.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** in questioning wonder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:19]** Dr. O'Kay raises a tentacle to his mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:19]** Oh.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:21]** Does he shush?

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:23]** Just like Nix and Cairo did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** Knock, knock, knock.

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:27]** There's another knock.

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:36]** Fierce gets out of bed without making too much noise, trying to not make too much noise, and then starts to shake, call in awake.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:37]** Can we see the map?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:38]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:39]** You can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:42]** Can you see what?

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:44]** Sorry to break the mood.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:44]** The tension.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** No, it's cool.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** Go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:47]** Yeah, no, it's good.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** Colin, get up.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:50]** You all probably can't see anything, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** Get up, get up, get up.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** It's a good save.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** A voice comes through the door.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:14]** They are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** They seem to be friendly.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:23]** As you say that, Rick grabs up his level one artillery rifle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:24]** There was discussion about who's being hurt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:28]** Just immediately points it at the door and hunkers down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:30]** I really mean you no harm.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** The name's Rudy Maglin.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:48]** Wanted to give thanks to whoever is inside here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:50]** Thanks for what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:56]** Well, you see, there's a body outside that I've been looking for.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** Wasn't hoping to bring him in as a body.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:04]** But if that was you all, I was just going to...

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:15]** Give you a thanks and ask you maybe if you'd seen anybody else out here in this bleak landscape.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:16]** He's a bounty hunter.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:17]** Is he a bounty hunter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:21]** Yeah, what do you do for a living?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:25]** Feels kind of weird talking through the door here.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** Is it okay if...

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:31]** If we talk in person, I don't need to come in anything.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:38]** I probably wouldn't fit, but it feels a little weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:38]** I have a question.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** Could we access?

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:42]** Would Hears know if we could access cameras?

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:44]** Are there cameras on the outside of this facility?

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** I don't think you know.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** There's no cameras on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** Is there a slot in the door?

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:48]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:53]** There wasn't one earlier when you were talking with Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:56]** We didn't put one in while we were sleeping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** Yeah, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** Uh, Dr. OK is going to open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** You open the door.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:10]** And before you is this large creature.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** I'll open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:14]** Oh, no.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:15]** Is that a lava strider?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** There's a large creature.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** I just showed you guys.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:21]** I had show players of this creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:46]** impressive large man person that looks kind of like you go ahead and explain it's a it's a it's a grizzly bear with a capybara face yeah and he's wearing like like animal skins and talons and teeth and holding yeah like a mini gun instantly yeah this which is probably not good but i do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:48]** I instantly trust him.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** Yeah, he looks amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:51]** The thing is, he's really close to the door.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:58]** So you can mostly just see like thick legs and these like kind of furs that underneath have this tech armor.

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** It's really light, very flexible.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:04]** And then the head just, I'm going to do it in camera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:07]** The head like, hey, it's Rudy.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:10]** The head peeks down.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** I really don't mean you any harm.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:17]** This is my, this is my rider, Sherry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** We're best buds.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:22]** Points to a lava strider.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:25]** That's like the largest lava strider that you've seen so far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** He is large.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:31]** You know this to be a, yeah, Kelly, what's up?

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:31]** I'm sorry.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** I didn't want to interrupt your monologue.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:35]** I just want to say to everyone now, metagame, I want him on our team.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:36]** Okay.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:39]** So like everyone, please try to make him be on our team.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:42]** He's got a joy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** You know that these are megalonyxes.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:49]** M-E-G-A-L-O-N-Y-X-A.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** Megalonyxes.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:52]** They are...

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:54]** A recent addition to the PAX world.

**[00:26:55 - 00:27:04]** So I don't think you need to do a check because maybe you've read some, Dr. K, you've read some journals about this, some sociological journals, right?

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:08]** You've read some, there's been some like new politics around it.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** Starfinder story time?

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** Yeah.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:13]** Is this a little bit of a Starfinder story time?

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** I have it.

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:15]** I have it open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:16]** Do you want to read it?

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Do it.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** Go ahead.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** I'm too excited.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** I'm waiting for the children's show.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:21]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:28]** Starfinder Storytime!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:52]** finally a creature that you actually haven't seen yeah right yeah so knowledgeable uh the stocky megalonyxa is that right hail from the heavy gravity world of karnak in the vast there they contemplated the stars as a mostly sedentary species and were able to build a thriving civilization through the use of magic

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** because they're probably pretty lazy.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** So spaceflight eluded them, however.

**[00:27:55 - 00:28:01]** As such, when extraplanetary visitors arrived, they found a highly evolved society eager to take to the stars.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:09]** Within a few decades, all megalonyxes left Karnak, all of them, consigning their cities and other settlements to the wastes of history.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:14]** Explorers from other worlds can learn much from these remains if they can withstand the planet's crushing gravity.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:19]** A tipple megalonyx stands about 10 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:21]** And I love this description of them.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:24]** They're just the cutest things ever, even though they're huge as ****.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:24]** I love it.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:33]** They're massive, but they're like, yeah, they're... It's an interesting idea that they... Yeah, they had like first contact and then they're like, yo, let's GTFO.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:34]** Like, we're done.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:37]** Like, thank goodness we've been waiting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:40]** There's more to life than this tiny little village.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:48]** All the megalonicas that died the day before the first contact, really, that's like the worst, you know, place to be.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:53]** Yeah, so, like I was saying, hello, I'm Rudy.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:55]** Kind of sticks in a paw to you, Dr. Oka.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:59]** Pleased to meet you, my...

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:02]** Megalonyx?

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** Megalonyx.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** Megalonyx, uh, matey?

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:09]** Uh, pleased to meet you.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** I'm Dr. Okay.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** Pleasure, Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** Is it, uh... Here, sorry, I'll step back.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:16]** You can get a full view of me.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:17]** Look at me.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:18]** Steps back.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:20]** Didn't mean to crowd the door.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:21]** Oh...

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:23]** Hello there, fellow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** Why is my lighting weird?

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:27]** I'm stepping outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:36]** There was another that this poor, unfortunate convict...

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:40]** Was with, went southeast, I believe.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** Southwest?

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:43]** Southeast.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:45]** Southwest.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** Sorry, southwest.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:49]** I get my bearings all fuzzy around here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** It's been a while.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:59]** He looked southwest, and then you see him calculate in his head.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:02]** He looks up at the stars, and he thinks for a second.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:11]** And you can see him arrive at some sort of conclusion just through his innate skills and sense of tracking and survival.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:16]** All right, that's really good to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:18]** Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:20]** Yeah, not a problem.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:24]** Do you mind if I just take a look at this individual over here?

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:26]** Did they identify themselves?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:29]** That one called herself Nyx.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** That's what I thought.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:34]** Bends over, very gentle with the body, checks it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:38]** What can you tell us about them?

**[00:30:39 - 00:30:47]** From my assumptions is that you are some kind of bounty hunter for the stewards and or the prisons located on this planet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** You're half right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** Not the stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** I don't really need to get involved with them.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:52]** The...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:52 - 00:31:17]** prisons uh yes meanwhile he's like kind of checking over the body and he like puts his finger over some of the marks from the magic missile from the shots from bernice from all that stuff and that one was here's that was me so this was you all here's hello yeah hi i'm rudy i didn't catch all your names dr okay here's and you the android who's very questionable got it rick all right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:20]** Yeah, he's an android, but we don't hold it against him.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:22]** Because if they did, they wouldn't be here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:24]** He was just adding him to his Pokédex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:26]** All right, looks like it's time to go.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:29]** Yeah.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:31]** Colin, I'm assuming you stout too.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** He picks up Nyx.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:53]** walks over sherry the lava strider kind of gets down like a horse on one knee and or on both knees and he's able to start like laying the body appropriately he has some like some saddlebags that he's able to kind of like lay her in that's a bit of like a you know body bag


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:59]** Like I said, I wasn't planning on bringing back a body, but sometimes in this line of work, you have to.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:03]** I am a... Well, I'm a second-generation flighter.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** That's a term you probably don't know.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:07]** It's a Carnock term.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:11]** But, yeah, I work for the prisons here.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:16]** Be that as it may, I work for them.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:18]** I'm usually never there.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:22]** I'm always out trying to find whoever thinks that they can escape.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:29]** You know, the policy at some of these places is a little bit of a lack of security because where are you going to go?

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** So that's where I come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:35]** I guess that answers my next question.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:39]** Can you please explain which prison you believe they come from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** They come from, pulls out data pad, checks.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:49]** Nyx and Cairo come from Vero Station 4, also called the Eternal Sauna.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:53]** If you heard that, you know, that's unbeknownst to me.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:55]** I've never really done a sauna there.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** This is hot enough as it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:00]** They have that patch on their arm that says sauna.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:06]** Good eye walks over, checks, you know, kind of pulls out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:09]** Is there prize money for these bodies?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** No, there's no prize money.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:14]** There's just trying to make sure that they come back preferably alive.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:16]** And if not, that they come back at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** Yeah.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:19]** Excuse me.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:24]** Is there any information about what reason they were incarcerated?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** What reason they were incarcerated?

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:30]** Yeah, what was their sentence?

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** Let me look.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:31]** Let me see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:34]** Something about burning bridges after you cross them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** Yeah, something weird.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** Something about that.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:47]** He looks through and sees that they've been in there for a few months.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** Yeah, pretty recent.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:55]** There aren't too many escapees at this time of the year.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:58]** They've been in there a few months.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:03]** Looks like they weren't the only ones to escape at that same time.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:05]** However, comma.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** Sorry, I'm digressing.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:08]** Like, zooms in.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:17]** Seems like they were here on planet already and made some... Huh.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:21]** They made some sort of ruckus or trouble.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:45]** kind of keep some of these details from me so trying to figure it out solitary confinement or some kind of higher security facility they have everything there for all types of people these are one of the prisons that you forget exists you know there are a lot of moons out there a lot of you're suggesting that these two were in a

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:53]** different prison on this planet and were moved to the sun after no they were free people before they came to this prison they happen to be here

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:58]** Seems like they were at a mine.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** I wonder if that's the same.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** There's a mine.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:07]** Don't know where you all are headed, but there's a nice little place to stop.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:10]** It's further southeast.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** Points in the direction.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:13]** That happens to coincide with Terrapin.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:19]** Further southeast, there's a mine that you might want to stop by if you're trying to bed down for the night.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:23]** How far past the communications center is it?

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:45]** uh oh you mean that that that place built into the cliff i think it's a steward's place are we talking about yeah it's before that after the cliffs though you're gonna have to find a way i don't know if you're gonna get down there and these things kind of looks over and sees your vehicles and like somewhat repair you know but also like a lot of char marks a lot of things missing um

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:50]** I can maybe try and help you out with some of those repairs if you're heading down the cliffs.

**[00:35:51 - 00:36:01]** Like I said, seems like they were at some mine and arrested for some sort of trouble, taken into custody, and just taken, you know, down the street, so to speak.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:04]** Who runs the mine?

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:04]** get ready.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:11]** Last time I saw, there's people there that, a couple of Azers there that I don't think that mine's functional anymore.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** I think that they came in for some other reason.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:16]** Friendly folk.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** Nice people.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:19]** You get to know the locals around here.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** They're really spread out.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** It's a really low population density.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:32]** And I say that, but you can tell a little bit that he is clearly a thinker, and he is a...

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:56]** bounty hunter you know kind of like trophy hunter for these people like he can lock in on a target but the only way that he's able to be successful at this for so long it's a harsh environment is by being so like crafty and intelligent as he is and he clearly has a family lineage of like reading and intelligence he's speaking in a way that you feel like he is he elucidates very clearly


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:36:56 - 00:37:24]** uh i'm gonna roll since motive sure even though i have a zero i don't know why so i believe go ahead rick i feel like i'm gonna have a blue because i like him so much but i'm gonna roll um let's see oh i rolled a four actually it was a nat fail and then like there's like a plus three i mean i mean that doesn't change it well you can't fail skills but that's fine okay so you rolled a four it makes sense for me yeah it makes sense because you like him i really do

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:27]** I think Rick is actually starting to really trust this guy.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:34]** And he's going to give a pause and kind of look back at the group before he starts to speak.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** So if anybody wants to stop me.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:38]** Speak about what?

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:40]** What are you going to tell him?

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:40]** Everything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:43]** What was that supposed to mean, Kevin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** I'm about to do something.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** So if anyone wants to stop me, just here you go.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** Look, this is the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:55]** So, Rudy, what do you know of the Stewart's base and the comm station that you referred to?

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** Can you give us any information on that?

**[00:37:59 - 00:37:59]** I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** That's not a problem.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** Can I ask you a question?

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:05]** If it's all right.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:09]** I used to work on The Last Call.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:09]** You know what that is?

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:10]** The movie?

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** No.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:14]** There's a movie called The Last Call on the Infosphere.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** Sweet.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:16]** That's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:21]** No, the Last Call, you would know without a culture check.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:27]** It is a colony ship that's a temple.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** It's a flying temple.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** It's pretty cool.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:36]** A Phrasman sect called the Cemeterians started this colony ship called the Last Call.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:45]** And it's basically a place where if you or someone on your crew...

**[00:38:45 - 00:39:01]** have some sort of fatal disaster out in space and there's no place for you know if you die gruesomely there's no place for any last rights you pull up to the ship called the last call that has a slogan that says let the end be an ending

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** And it's a trading post.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:04]** It's a morgue.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:07]** It's a neutral ground.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:20]** It's basically a place for you to go and handle those services that you would for either handling a body, being sure that it gets buried with the appropriate rights.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** There are a lot of temples there.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:27]** Or hiring somebody because someone you knew was killed gruesomely and you want to seek retribution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** Sorry.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:42]** I worked on the last call for a while trying to help out some people when they were looking to stick it to whoever stuck it to their friend or loved one.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:47]** So I like to know a little bit more about the people that I'm talking to.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:53]** I feel like we're on the same page, you know, ergo we're becoming a little friendly.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** Why are you four here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:00]** So we are not stewards, as you can tell.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:04]** But we were rescued by the stewards during an event.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:07]** That I cannot get into.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** That's okay.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** I don't understand that entirely.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:10]** Sure.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:13]** What I can say is that we had to escape the stewards' base.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:17]** Which you might have heard the explosion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:20]** Yeah, I clocked that earlier this afternoon.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:24]** Congratulations on getting out without being in that explosion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:28]** We may have lost some friends there.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** I'm sorry to hear that.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:33]** We are quite concerned about the stewards themselves.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:38]** Have you heard anything about the stewards on this planet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:38]** Not at all.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** I don't really talk to them that much.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:46]** Occasionally, you know, you don't see that many people here when you're moving across the landscape.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:50]** So when somebody drives by in one of those, points to your police cruiser.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** You wave.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:52]** You say hi.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** You get to know their face.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:55]** Saw a couple people.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:57]** That's about it.

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:00]** Sometimes they're headed to that comms place that they got.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Otherwise.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Don't know too much about them.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** They help me sometimes.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:14]** Like they've, they've, you know, long, long story short, they have helped me find people occasionally, but we don't really co-work.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** I'm not really a co-worker.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** I solo work.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:24]** What would you know about greys or reptoids?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_11

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** I'm sorry about what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:31]** Have you, have you heard of reptoids or greys?


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:38]** I mean, like I would, like I would scare my little girl when she was a little girl.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:39]** Yeah.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** I've heard about crazy toys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:41]** Yeah.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:44]** Can I, can I roll sense motive on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:44]** Sure.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:46]** Let's put a special day.

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:50]** Oh, yo, we blow with that special die though.

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:52]** About to drop this special die though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:57]** Uh, that is a 13 plus 12.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** So 25, 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:01]** Yeah.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** He seems like he is,

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:06]** He didn't expect that question to come out of Rick19's mouth.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:11]** And to him, he pulls up, thinks you're stewards.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** You come out.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:15]** You're like, we're not stewards, but you're not trying to attack.

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:18]** He can put two and two together that you've probably taken out, Nix.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** And then you're like, yeah, we're not stewards, but we do have their vehicles.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:27]** And so he's like, he's a little like... Plus.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:37]** Not sus, but you can tell that he's clearly dealt with a lot of people who are in a lot of different stages of grief and life.

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:46]** And he is someone who professionally goes to take prisoners, at least for this job, and bring them back to a pretty bleak prison.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:53]** So he's not sus, but he's able to let the tide kind of come in.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** He can just follow the current, but he's still tracking it.

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:58]** He's still like, yeah, sure.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:02]** I know of the stories of greys and reptoids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:09]** I've been around a lot of different corners in this galaxy trying to find something for somebody or other.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** Haven't found them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:16]** But he wasn't like, yeah, I know a totally normal amount of facts about reptoids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:18]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:23]** Does the... What was it called?

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** Obscura?

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:26]** Palace of Atlas?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:29]** Palace Obscura.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:38]** These two... Well, this poor unfortunate soul out here kept rattling on about getting back to the...

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** Palace of Obscura and entering it.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:44]** Know anything about that in your travels, friend?

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:46]** Palace of Obscura.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:51]** No, I don't.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** That some city thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:58]** Somewhere maybe on Leovara.

**[00:43:58 - 00:43:59]** Leovara.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** Great place to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** You've been to Roselight?

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:05]** Have I been to Roselight?

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:06]** Yeah.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** Yeah, you've been to Roselight.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:12]** That was a little weird, like, affectation with which you said that there, here's.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** But, yeah, I've been to Rose Light.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** There's a lot of fun things in Rose Light.

**[00:44:17 - 00:44:17]** You going to Rose Light?

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:18]** You'll like it.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:19]** It's cool.

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** It's a good place.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:27]** Look, here's the kicker, because at the end of the day, what could I do to...

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:29]** Maybe help you guys out a little bit.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:30]** I have a question.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** What are the questions you have?

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** Yeah, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:35]** Speaking of places, do you know anything about Terrapin Station?

**[00:44:36 - 00:44:38]** It's kind of close by and we're not familiar.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:40]** We're not sure of its purpose.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** Do you happen to know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Is that the name?

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Can I ask you something else?

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:44]** I'm going to ask you.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** Sorry.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:47]** I tend to be a little blunt about these things.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:49]** Why do you want to go to Terrapin Station?

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** Look, I'm all for helping.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** It's hard to be out here.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** It's hard to be a person out here.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:58]** But, you know, I got to notice you're not stewards, but you have stewards vehicles.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** I'm not going to ask.

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:01]** I've been around a lot of people.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:04]** So I just want to ask just an innocent question.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** That makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:10]** I think the truth is that we just want to get off.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:30]** planet gotcha and totally we know that there is a ship at terrapin station that will help us okay possibly ultimately there are also other people at that location that some of your friends yeah oh oh not your friends well we don't know we're not sure that's why we were hoping you might not sure


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:43]** Because we just want to, obviously, we had this conversation with your target, but now we just want to relax and avoid issues from now on.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** Yeah.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:45]** So what do you know about it, Rudy?

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** Looks at his data pad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:47]** I got a few minutes.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** All right, that's fine.

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** I'm not in a hurry.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** Me, in a hurry, out here?

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:53]** No, there's no hurry out here.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** Look, riddle me this.

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:02]** Why do you put a station out in the middle of nowhere?

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** You rarely send people to it.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:09]** It's not big.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:11]** Maybe five or six people there ever.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** Got some pets with them.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** I'll be hiding something.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:50]** Maybe only for a select few to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:54]** I'm not paid to question what these big corps do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:03]** Say, do you think you can lend us a hand with getting our vehicles fixed up?

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:59]** Like, he's sharp.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:04]** So you think, like, he probably wanted to make sure that, like, you aren't people that he's supposed to find.
