**[00:01:27 - 00:01:27]** Coming in hot.

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:33]** On your speakers, however you're listening, in your car, in your AirPods, in... Where else could you be listening?

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:33]** On your yacht?

**[00:01:33 - 00:01:34]** In a plane?

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:38]** On your yacht in the south of France.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:40]** On your yacht in the south of France.

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** Benny, what was that?

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:43]** On my toilet is where I usually listen.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:45]** Yeah, just like, just chilling.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** You put the phone in the toilet as a natural amplifier.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:47]** Is that right?

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** Yeah.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:48]** Yeah, okay, cool.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:54]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:56]** From the International Space Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** From the ISS.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Do you think those astronauts listen to us?

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** Is that why we had the unknown location?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:04]** We've seen some unknown locations on our analytics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** That could be.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:09]** Or is that why we get like one in random countries?

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:14]** No, it has its own DNS.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** But it's in geostationary orbit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** Really?

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:21]** No, it's not geostationary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:24]** No, it cycles the Earth like 18 times a day.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** It has like 18 free downloads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Right.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** Yeah.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:33]** No, it has its own top-level domain, even, I think.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:34]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Oh, wow.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:35]** Damn.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** That's cool.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:40]** Well, if you're on the ISS, say hi on our Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:43]** You guys have internet up there, right?

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:44]** That's good.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:45]** What's up, everybody?

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** Your fabulous friends here at Will Save coming in.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:51]** John Swan, Kelly, Will, Benny, and Kevin.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:57]** And my banter this week is that I would love to...

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** Get into playing.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:58]** I'm not going to lie.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** I want to, I want to you guys up.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:09]** I want to, I want to see what happens when, when we just get into a little fisticuffs, you know, just want to, just want to have a little good hearted star finder fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:13]** You know, this is the first time in 34 years that John has picked a fight with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** What happened 34 years ago?

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:23]** The last time I think to fight with you was in the womb.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:29]** Your moms hugged each other when we were metaphysical beings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** Fetus fisticuffs.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:33]** Will would know because he was there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:34]** He's been there the entire time.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** I egged him on, actually.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** I was poking him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:40]** You egged him on.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:42]** You started between our moms.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:47]** Dana White is a mere imitation of what Will was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:53]** That's so funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:53]** That's amazing.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** Kelly.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** Here's to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:39]** That's perfect.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** He's the only one.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:44]** I don't like banter, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:47]** No better, no better.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** Hate them talking.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:51]** Their dogs ate avocados.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:51]** Amazing.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:59]** I want to shout out 25 North, the podcast.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** Yes, yes.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:03]** We've never shouted them out before, but they're always in the promo channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:07]** And I'm so intrigued by what is 25 South?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:10]** Is it going to be... It's their other one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:14]** Well, 25 North is... North the, like...

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** The latitude?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:16]** Hold on.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:18]** Which one was it again?

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** Wasn't the last promo 25 South?

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** And that's all it was.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:25]** It was just like an image of like a black and white map and then it says 25 South.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** And I was just like, I'm so intrigued.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:31]** I don't know if this is going to be a Pathfinder game or if it's going to be something different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** It's another podcast, y'all.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** And there's a guy in our Discord.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:35]** His name is Jason.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** And he's pretty cool.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** And he's into cars and stuff.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** And I'm into that.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** Is he like in Miami?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** Or like Miami?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:49]** Let us know where 25 North comes from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** I asked them once before, and I forgot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:54]** Or maybe we have to listen to their show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** I think we'd listen.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:55]** Yeah.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:56]** I think we'd listen.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:59]** I'll just stream it right now through our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** Let's not play our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** Let's just listen to them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:03]** I'm down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:07]** Hey, you guys remember three minutes ago when we were about to start our game?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:09]** And then there was no banter?

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** Yeah.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:10]** No.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** Good call, Kelly.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:12]** Shout out to 25 North.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:13]** You rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** I just asked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** Great.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:15]** Thank you.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** I heard those notifications come in.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:18]** Cool.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Let's get going.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** Let's get playing.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:25]** Last time, a lot of revelations for our friend Colin Edenbrand.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:25]** Colin.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** Yeah.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** Gaslighting.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** Colin, how are you feeling?

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** Quick check.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** Your thoughts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:35]** I'm really thankful I've had a whole week to process all this stuff.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:48]** And, like, to really sit with how shit Orvier Pike is for inciting the name of Colin's parents and his presumed dead sister.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:50]** Dude poked a bear.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:51]** Yeah, no.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:57]** That is not... That is the hill that Colin is definitely willing to die on.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** So, like...

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:02]** Let's run these hands, motherf***er.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:02]** Love it.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** Okay.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:04]** Fist he cuffs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:05]** Fetus he cuffs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** He's no longer a fetus, but he's got a fist he cuffs.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:12]** I'm still viscerally angry a week later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:16]** Yeah, you're like, I'm glad I took a week to think about it, take it, think about it.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** I'm still f***ing pissed.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** Still incensed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:21]** Oh, no, I've had seven days and I'm still choosing violence.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** Yeah, totally.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:22]** So let's fucking go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:33]** So in that chest, you found clothes that look like they belong to some sort of Ringworks uniform, you think?

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:43]** Dr. O'Kay starts exploring further into the room and sees another room beyond that's a bathroom.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** But the sink is on.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:49]** And I don't think I, you knew it.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:50]** I didn't need to say it.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:57]** Both sinks are on full blast running extremely hot water.

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:00]** Like as hot as the sink can go, as hot as the tap can go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:08]** Did they adjust their water heater to like boiling or where are they at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:14]** They, it is absolutely damaging the fixtures for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:22]** So I would get like, if I were to put my tentacle in there, I'd probably get like a first degree or second degree burn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:24]** You would definitely get at least a D6 for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:27]** You would definitely get a D6.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** D6 is a lot, man.


## Speaker_0

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:30]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** Maybe D4.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** That's like a Slavaha?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** Is it Slavaha?

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** No, no, no, no.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:35]** D4.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** D4.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** D4 minus one, min one.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:47]** So you feel this and think this is definitely adding to the environment.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:56]** Also, just again, a sense of how they want to change the space, how they are like, you know, like you've seen one reptoid.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:59]** You don't know how many more there are, but like, yeah, what's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:01]** I don't think they pay their water bill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:02]** They don't.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:02]** No.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:03]** They don't.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** This place is off-map, man.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:08]** They're just pulling from their own spot, you know?

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:09]** It's covered by the stewards.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:15]** I imagine whatever gray water tank they've, like, got this water from.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** It's gray water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** Gray water tank?

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:22]** It's just recirculating back into the faucet.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:26]** It's just a bunch of grays working over just the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:28]** Just one gray in the back with a pump.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** Guys, I really need a break.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:32]** Working nine to five.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:41]** That's the side story that we need, is the Grey hired by the Reptoid stewards to be their grey water tank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:45]** It's a lizard mutant Grey making grey water.

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:53]** He's been banished to pump water with a hand pump in a sci-fi universe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:53 - 00:10:18]** Yes, it's just pumping away somewhere just pulling away somewhere


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** What is our capacity to go off the rails?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:24]** Yes Unlimited

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** Speaking of rails.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:38]** Yeah, so you all are, three of you are looking in that room that, again, is like room that you surmise must be some sort of interrogation room.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:50]** There are no locks holding people down, but that device that Dr. O'Kay found, rather the accessories that lead to the device, it must be pretty intense.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:51]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:54]** Rick 18 standing guard outside in here is like a shuffle.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** I'll put some full siren sound in there.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:03]** And you think, hmm, there's somebody in that room on the right.

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** There's something happening.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:07]** It sounds like a door is unlocked or locked.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:09]** Call for help.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:13]** You all post up like the squad you are.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** Strong teamwork.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:21]** I'll bring you guys back to the map while the game is paused and you get ready.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:23]** Rick prepares to shoot.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** Prepares to shoot.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** Here's ready.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** He's magic missile.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:31]** I don't know that you can do that, but we'll say that you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:33]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:39]** And Colin got a 10 and is just waiting.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** He's just, he's just, he's just air fighting.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:43]** He's just pumping himself up.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:46]** He just got his shoulders going ready to go.

**[00:11:50 - 00:12:05]** And it's with that, that you open the door and it is only Rick 19 who sees a gun from around the sofa.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:09]** You see this room that looks like it starts to be maybe a lounge.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:17]** And Rick19, you see a gun around the sofa starting to charge up.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** You are the only person to technically notice it.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:24]** But we're going to go into a surprise round, and I'm going to include a lot of y'all.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:27]** For the sake of this, let's f***ing roll initiative.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:28]** Let's go.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:28]** Hey!

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:30]** Hey!

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** Let's get this.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:31]** Here we go!

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** Let's get this party started.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** I'm going to pause here.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:36]** Give me one sec.

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:40]** Put you guys... Go ahead and put y'all on the...

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** on the map hizzle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:48]** Also, you can ready an action, ready a spell, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:56]** Speaking of which, we all did ready, including Rick, I readied to shoot at anything hostile, and a gun charging up is definitely something hostile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:19]** but we'll get into that in a second let's just figure out what we got for the initiative dr okay what did you get i got a four you got a four total four total four total four wow okay all right total four uh what about you here cerise what do you get

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** I got a 10.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** You got a 10.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** Okay, we're working up in this order.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** And what about Rick19?

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:28]** 21.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:32]** 21 for Rick19.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:35]** And what about Colin Edenbrand, the incensed guy in the corner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:37]** Colin also got a 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** You got a 10.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:38]** Okay.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:40]** All right.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** I like it.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:42]** All right.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:50]** So you see in front of you, Rick19, you recognize this person, perhaps.

**[00:13:50 - 00:14:00]** This is a steward android, female android, that is crouching and you think,

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:03]** I saw them at Turcalis.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** I saw them at Turcalis.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** And they are trying to shoot at you.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:17]** Now, since I believe everybody except Colin readied an action, we're going to go into a surprise round because they readied an action.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:21]** And so you all will get either one move or one standard.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:26]** And we will go in the order of initiative.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:27]** And that's Rick19.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** First, what are you going to do?

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** I'm going to shoot.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** Duh.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:35]** You're going to walk in and say, hey, yeah, that's cool.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:35]** I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:38]** No, I'm standing right where I am.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:40]** That is a 22 to hit.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:42]** 22 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Does it hit?

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:46]** Yeah, it hits.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:47]** Yes, that hits.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** Well, actually, hang on.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:54]** Hang on one second.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:57]** Yeah, she's crouching behind that.

**[00:14:58 - 00:14:58]** And you know what?

**[00:14:59 - 00:14:59]** It still hits.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** Yes, it does.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:02]** Yes, it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** Five on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:09]** Plus six is 11 plus one more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:12]** And as he fires...

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:15]** His gun gets real hot on his hand.

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:17]** It actually burns him enough to cause him.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:25]** No, it just causes him one point of damage because that's what the modifications that the Acer did does to me.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:30]** So they gave me a brown force field, which is one hit point.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** So basically I get a free extra point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:33]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:36]** Damage until you drop your brown force.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** Okay, cool.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:37]** I like it.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:39]** So that's 12 points of damage, right?

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:41]** And how much of that is fire?

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** All of it all of it.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:57]** Okay Okay, cool the shot singes some of the couch hits them in the shoulder you hear them cry out and Rick Nadine you notice that not a

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:59]** All of that went through.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:02]** Great.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:07]** It is their turn to shoot at you.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:11]** And boy, do they deliver.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:12]** I hope so.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** With a 22 back.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** That a hit?

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** Against EAC.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** Yeah.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:25]** More fire damage coming at you with seven points of fire damage hitting you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:28]** Seven points of fire damage.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:31]** Flies across.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:33]** We are in a surprise round.

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:38]** Little tit for tat from Rick19 and this steward.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:42]** Then Colin, I don't think you had it ready to action.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:44]** So it is going to move to Dr. Okay.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:46]** You had ready to action.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:46]** What are you going to do?

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** Move or standard?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:49]** Yeah.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:55]** So I'm going to tell, because I don't think I can really see this person from my vantage point.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** Okay.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** But Bernice can.

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:58]** Ooh.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:06]** And so she's going to take a shot with some covering fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** Ooh.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:09]** Okay.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** A little AC 15.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** Yeah.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** Okay.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Give me that covering fire.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** Let me know how you do.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** That's a 16.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:18]** 16.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:18]** That meets it.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:21]** That gets done what you need to do.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:26]** And you are trying to have that covering fire for which individual?

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:28]** For which ally?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:29]** I'm going to say Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:30]** Rick.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:31]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** I like it.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:33]** I like it.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:35]** So there's shots going back and forth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:38]** You get a plus two to your AC on the next turn, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:38]** Ooh.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:39]** Copy that.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:39]** Thank you.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:40]** That's great.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:42]** So you're firing.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:53]** Rick, you see these shots come from behind you and go in a line, I think, across the couch, just trying to get that couch, put the pressure on, make sure that they do not keep.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:53]** Yo, couch.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:54]** Yo, couch.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** I hate this couch, Bernice says.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** Awesome.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:58]** Awesome.

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:00]** Dr. K, that was great.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:03]** Do you want to do anything else?

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** Because I think that was Bernice.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:06]** Well, that was your... Yeah.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:09]** Do you want to move in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** I suppose I can move on.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:12]** Yeah.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:13]** Okay.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** I'm going to move just into the hallway.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** Okay.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:17]** And then I can kind of see now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:18]** Copy.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:19]** Okay.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** You move forward.

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:20]** I like it.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:23]** Bernice went, here's what are you doing?

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** You also readied magic.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:27]** Miss Seattle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:30]** I did, but I can't see this person, can I?

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:31]** Yeah.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:35]** Can I hold that ready until after my move action?

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** Well, I wouldn't really make a difference anyway then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** You would just drop.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:42]** Yeah, so you can either do a standard or a move right now.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:45]** Or you can let go of your surprise round if you don't want to do anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:48]** I can't do anything with it anyway, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:52]** Yeah, the ready allowed you to act in this surprise round.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:54]** So you can either move up, but I can't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** Well, you can.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:56]** I see what you're saying.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** You can move up.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** I got a surprise round.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** Right.

**[00:18:59 - 00:18:59]** Yeah.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:00]** Yeah.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:00]** I don't.

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:01]** Oh, there she is.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:03]** OK, here's like a dumb.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:08]** I guess actually walks in front of the door and then like right in front of like, oh, great.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:11]** She's like right there in front of everyone.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** So he'll probably get hit next.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** But then he's going to fire.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** You can't fire.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:15]** Two magic misses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:19]** No, it's a surprise when you get a movement or a standard action.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:21]** Do you want to end your turn in front of God and everybody?

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:22]** No.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** I didn't think so.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** You did have enough move action to do that.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** You could have moved forward and then moved back.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:29]** There we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:31]** Okay, so you just stepped up.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:33]** I'm going to go behind Rick where I can see her.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** Okay.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:39]** Rick will not be a casualty with my targeted magic weapons.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:40]** Okay.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:41]** All right.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** I like it.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:42]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:43]** I like it.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:43]** I like it.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** Okay.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:46]** Top of round one.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:51]** Rick19, what do you do on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:53]** Full round.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:56]** Rick is going to move forward.

**[00:19:56 - 00:20:03]** He realizes as he hits, he sees that the laser from his artillery laser doesn't actually get all the way through.

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:07]** And so he's going to move forward into the room.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:31]** Mm-hmm, and I think kind of like he scoots past everyone into the door and he sweeps the room Just to make sure there's not anybody else in the room And he sees that there's nobody there and he's gonna step up right in front of her face He's let me pause right there as you do walk in you do see oh there is standing along the wall and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:35]** Another wet cell standing behind the table.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:45]** And I believe your perception check was high enough that you see another steward crouching behind the table in the corner.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:48]** It's a gripply steward.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:49]** What's a gripply?

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** The frog people.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** I know, they're so cool.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** Yeah, they're super cool.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:56]** So Rick19, you step in seeing these three individuals.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** Uh, he's going to step back out.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:04]** All right.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** Glad I didn't end my turn yet.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** I think you guys all see this.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:13]** He steps in and he sweeps a room and then he steps back out and he goes, two more bogeys to the left.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:20]** And then takes a shot at the steward behind the couch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:24]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:28]** That is not going to hit probably with a 21.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** 21 does hit.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:32]** It does hit.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:38]** Sorry, I need to... Give me a roll.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:41]** That's a 9 on the die.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:46]** So my force field then burns away as my hand lights up to fire.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:52]** But that's a 9 plus 7 for 16 points of fire damage.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** About half of that goes through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** 16 points of fire damage.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** Okay.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** Sounds good.

**[00:21:57 - 00:22:02]** And again, it looks like not all of it goes through, but that is pretty significant from two well-placed shots.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:03]** Really impressive.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** Okay.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:05]** You want to do anything else?

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:06]** You want to move out?

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:07]** I mean, that is my whole turn.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** That's your whole turn.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:14]** But Rick tells the others that there's the two more boogies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** No worries.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** Of course, of course, of course.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:22]** This steward is actually going to... Ah, that's right.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:36]** There's just a brief pause and you think, waiting, wondering if... What's she going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** What's she going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:44]** You will stop.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:52]** And then the gun just comes out and fires again.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:55]** That's 22 against your EAC.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** Rick, that hits.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:59]** That's another hit.

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:02]** And that is five more points of damage to your stamina.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:02]** What are you at?

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** I'm fine.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:05]** Okay, cool.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** All right, great.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** I got half stamina, full hit points.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:08]** Play coy.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:09]** No, that's cool.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** That's good.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:10]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** You said five points of damage, right?

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** Five points of damage.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:15]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:42]** and then the wet cell walking like their knees are bent backwards just literally walks like over the chair and the table in the creepiest way possible where like one leg sort of pushes them up and one hand pushed against the wall and they move through as if their body doesn't move but their legs are moving to like keep their body steady the whole time walks up

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:47]** And takes a swing at Rick19 with its claws.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:53]** Rick19, that is a 19 against KAC.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:54]** That's a miss.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** That's a miss?

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** Get out of here.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** Ding!

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:01]** The claw just scratches through the side of the door.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:04]** Dang!

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:04]** Well done.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:06]** Colin Edenbrand, what are you doing?

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** You...

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:25]** are just about to act and besides all this shot suddenly there you see just part of a claw like almost come through the frame around the door because it's so thin it just and it comes back out what do you do i don't like that the other steward looks like slippy toad from starfox


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** Do a barrel roll.

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:28]** No one wants to hurt him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:29]** Like, I don't want to hurt him.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** He looks great.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:32]** Let's make him our friend.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:34]** But it's not really a frog person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:34]** It's a lizard thing.

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** It's a lizard thing.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:37]** Right.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** Benny, I can't hear you at all.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:42]** I don't, I don't.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:43]** Sorry, buddy.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** Had to tell you over, over this.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:55]** This break in the voice from Benny brought to you by Sirenscape so we can hear the music.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:55]** Thank you, Sirenscape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** He burned his mic up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:00]** Our partner who said, hey, why don't you mute people randomly so you can hear the music?

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:01]** That's great.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** Yeah.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** That's super.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:06]** What a way to show your music off.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** Let's explore Sirenscape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:10]** Just start pushing random sounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:12]** Yeah, do it.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:13]** Let's see.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** All right.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:16]** Well, there is... Let's see.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:16]** There's this one.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:19]** There's that.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** That's good.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:27]** Wasn't that supposed to be... Didn't we say that was supposed to be something?

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** Yes.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:34]** When you're riding a magic missile, it goes... Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** Please, no.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:38]** I want something else from Sirenscape for that.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:41]** I want it to be... Oh, wow.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:43]** That one's pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:44]** I could see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:46]** That was the flamethrower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:51]** Yeah, there was a blip in my audio devices.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:54]** Let's play one more thing and then we'll just get right back into it.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** What about this one?

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:57]** Boom!

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:58]** Okay.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** All right.

**[00:25:59 - 00:25:59]** Oh, love it.

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:01]** Some glass shatter at the end there.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:01]** Oh, God!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:12]** So, I think Cullen, his seeing red and wanting to pick a fight is probably a bit tempered by what appears to be the tactical advantage that these folks have.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:15]** So, his next action is going to be to close the f***ing door.

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:16]** Oh!

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:40]** all right you take an action to open it and take a step back to that's a good idea like ready a needler pistol shot into whatever opens the door next okay all right i like it you know what shoot that's it go for it okay that's the whole turn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:42]** And we're out of combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:44]** No.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** And that's it.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:48]** And that was the end of book three.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:51]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:51]** That was it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** That was the boss battle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** Oh, sorry, my bad.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:55]** Oh, guys, I'm really sorry.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** I didn't mean to walk in on you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:57]** Oh, whoops.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:01]** I thought that it was a Grateful Dead-like fest, you know.

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:04]** So, okay, you walk away.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:06]** You're like, shut the door.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:06]** I like it.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:08]** This music is perfect for it.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** What happens next?

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:13]** You hear.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:19]** Actually, Dr. OK, Rick and Colin, give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:43]** nah what's eight plus 19 or nine 21 21 27 27 25 25 the three of you here the door sorry double doors down the hall here that's yeah rick was gonna say like he points to the door over there and says there's another entry do you hear that door unlock

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:45]** Are we allowed to move at a turn?

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** Well, all right.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:46]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:49]** Dr.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:51]** O.K., what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:51]** It is your turn.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:53]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** is going to go up to the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:56]** You can't save.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:57]** There's a threat nearby.

**[00:27:59 - 00:28:01]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:04]** The max I can move is 25 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:08]** You pass the door on your left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:11]** And Bernice is going to go 30 feet away.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:16]** Up behind, but she has to do it in... There's 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:18]** Okay.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:25]** She would technically only get 25 because she's moving through a friendly square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** Through a threatened square?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** Through Friendly Square.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:31]** So, like, it's legal terrain to move through a square.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:36]** There's no limitation on Friendly Squares because your friends will move out of the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:36]** Okay.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** Yeah.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** So, Bernice moves up.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** Dr. K moves down the hall.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:45]** Dr. K, as you're walking, you see the space.

**[00:28:45 - 00:29:06]** curve to your left right the hallway curves to your left it opens up a little bit you see another double door immediately to the north then you see another single door uh at the end of the hall and right next to you you actually pass a very secure looking door that has a little like slider in it and

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:10]** As you walk by, you see... This is perfect for you.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:12]** You see... Oh, I think your thing fell.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** Oh, your light.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:14]** Yeah, perfect.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:19]** You see, in Reptoid, this is perfect that you saw it.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:23]** There's a sign on the door that says, do not open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:24]** Oh.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:29]** Okay.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:29]** Now or later.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:34]** So... I'm...

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:38]** I mean, I can't open the other door yet.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** Should I roll the dice?

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:45]** I'm going to roll, see if I actually try and jimmy it open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** Which door?

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:48]** The door that is... The one that says don't open.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** Okay.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** It says don't open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:52]** It's asking to be opened.

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** That, to me, says open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** I love this.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** What are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:04]** And I rolled a 15, which if I do, you know, yes, I think that's a yes.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:07]** Vinny, give your hand up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:10]** Is the door you're not supposed to open on the left side or the right side of the hallway?

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** Left side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** Left side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:12]** Okay, cool.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** Go for it.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** Yeah, so I think Dr. O.K.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:20]** is going to try and do an engineering check to open it.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:22]** Okay, you got to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:22]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** Don't tell me what to do.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:24]** You're not my real dad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** Give me an engineering check.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** I love this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** What do Reptoids speak?

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** Is it Reptoidian?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** Yeah.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:33]** It's Reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** I rolled a 32 on Engineering.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** A 32 on Engineering.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:41]** And the door unlocks.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:46]** I think that is all of your... You can't open it now, so don't open it.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:49]** Let's see what happens when you open it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:53]** We should probably neutralize the threat for opening this strange door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** I love this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:57]** Or, you know, go for it.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** Who knows?

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:01]** Dr. O'Kane turns on the simulation and that threat's gone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:05]** He sees a door that says don't open and says, f*** it, I'm going to open it.

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:05]** I love it.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:06]** Excellent.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** And Bernice moved as well.

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:10]** What does Bernice want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:12]** I mean, that's all she can do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** Okay.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** All right.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** Love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:17]** Here's what would you like to do?

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:23]** Well, here's a sticking with his buddy, Rick, to help him out in case something comes out of that door.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** He opens the door.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:26]** They might like follow us out.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:26]** Okay.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** Rick opens the door.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** Here's opens the door.

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:28]** Yeah.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:33]** He's going to have his magic missiles ready to go if they come out that door.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** If they come out the door.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:38]** He's going to kind of go...

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:43]** on the other side, so that he can help with the other guys if he needs to be as well.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:44]** So he is.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:45]** He's waiting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** He's waiting.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** Biden is time.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** Playing the long game, as they say.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** From the book that that is.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** Top of round two.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:57]** Rick 19, what are you doing?

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:57]** You open the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:03]** Rick had like, he stepped back, took a shot, and then call and shut the door.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:08]** He took a shot, dodged the attack, and then the door shuts.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** So he's like, look at his gun.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:15]** And he realizes that at least that one steward has some kind of fire resistance.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:17]** And so he actually just sets his gun down.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:22]** Plus, just a reminder out loud, he's going to say like,

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:24]** There's another Wetzel.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:26]** They have that electromagnetic effect.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:29]** Try not to use electronic weapons.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:43]** And he's actually going to, with a swift action, unholster his gun and kind of just set it up against the wall and then draws out his axe and readies an action to attack.

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:44]** To attack, yeah.

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:50]** So he's going to use a move action to pull and then he's going to ready a standard action to attack when the door opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** Okay, got it.

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:53]** If there's a threat, open.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** Got it.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:54]** Okay.

**[00:32:54 - 00:32:55]** I mean, there's definitely a threat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:59]** If the door opens and there's somebody to hit on the other side, he's going to hit them.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:01]** Okay.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:01]** All righty.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** This is fantastic.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** I love this.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** Okay.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** Give me one second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:13]** TP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Let's f***ing go.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** Let's f***ing do it.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:16]** Oh, my God.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** I feel like I shouldn't open this door, but I...

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** Maybe you should.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** Maybe you should go for the crazy thing.

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:24]** Well, why not?

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** You won't.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:25]** No balls.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** No balls.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:28]** No balls.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** What?

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** Is that rude?

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:32]** Dr. O'Kade, does Dr. O'Kade have testicles?

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:32]** We've never talked about this.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:33]** Let's talk about it later.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** Next session.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:35]** Did you just say he won't?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** Or just like her man for taunting him?

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** Okay, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** Yeah, okay, cool.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:43]** Oh, all right.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** They have both.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** They have both.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** That's useful.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:56]** rick 19 it's round man the door in front of you opens good

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** And you're going to swing.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:02]** The Wetzel has opened the door.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:03]** Are you going to swing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** Yeah, I'm going to swing.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** Swing at the Wetzel.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** Let's go.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** Hold on.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:13]** I'm setting up my... I accidentally hit my greataxe on hero labs.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** I had to go out and hide it.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:15]** You're like, oh, okay.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:15]** I don't want to.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:17]** It's fine.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:19]** That's a plus eight to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:19]** Gross.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** Natural one.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:22]** 13 for a total of 21.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:25]** 21 is a hit on this.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** You are ridiculous.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:44]** No, great axes are analog.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:46]** I know, I'm messing with you.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** All right, so what's your damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:51]** That's a five on the die plus eight of slashing.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** So that's 13 points of slashing damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** 13 points of slashing.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:57]** Cuts into this Wetzel's shoulder.

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:00]** You are practiced at this point.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:29]** It's gonna miss.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:30]** It's gonna miss.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** That is a 27.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:34]** That doesn't miss, that hits.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:37]** That does hit indeed, I thought so.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:41]** That is going to be 10 points of slashing damage to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:44]** It's only gonna be five points of slashing damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:46]** How often can you use your nanite?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:48]** Five times a day!

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:50]** And how many times have you used it?

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:50]** Twice.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:53]** I have three more twice.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:56]** As the claw comes, his nanites surge and harden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** His nanites surge.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Yeah, they get hard.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** I like it.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:05]** Okay, Colin, what is your turn gonna be?

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** The door has opened.

**[00:36:06 - 00:36:08]** The wet cell is at the ready.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:24]** Seeing Rick handle this Wetzel quite competently, Cullen is going to stage himself in front of the north door, which appears to be connected to this back room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** Are you going to hold it shut?

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** You're just going to shout, hold on!

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:31]** Hodor!

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:31]** Hodor!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:32 - 00:36:40]** And he's going to cast a spell called... Oh, not that one.

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:43]** Stand by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** Nope, not that one.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:46]** Not fireball in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:50]** Called reflecting armor on himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** Ooh, reflecting armor.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:52]** Okay.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:57]** Which we'll find out what it does if one of these bogeys happens.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:59]** I bet it reflects whatever happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:01]** It's probably going to reflect.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Probably.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:04]** It might reflect.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** We'll all find out together.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:07]** We'll find out.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:07]** Who knows?

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:08]** Who knows?

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:10]** Okay.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** Alrighty.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:14]** It's going to be another turn.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:17]** And you wait.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** You cast Reflecting Armor on yourself.

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** You see yourself in your reflection.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:24]** You're like, wow, I look good.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** And nothing happens at the door.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** Dr. OK, what do you do?

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:32]** Do you open the door that you unlocked with a masterful check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:44]** I think Dr. OK is going to tell everyone, hey, guys, there's this Reptoid skeleton.

**[00:37:46 - 00:38:04]** sign scrolled on this door that says don't open uh i'm gonna i'm gonna open it okay and um he's gonna tell bernice shoot anything that moves in there okay

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:09]** or anything unfriendly right there in front of the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** Anything unfriendly.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** Okay.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:14]** So, sorry, you're taking a move action to open the door.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** Yes.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:20]** And then you have, you still have a standard action yourself and Bernice has a standard action to shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:20]** Yes.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:21]** Okay.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Okay.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:26]** Unless, I mean, I had my cost to jet out.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:31]** I can, I would probably switch back to the melee given the size of this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:32]** That's part of a move action.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** You could open a door and switch weapons.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:35]** Okay.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:37]** You'd have to drop the first one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** I don't want to drop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:48]** I'm just going to open the door.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:56]** He just opens the door inside this very, very small room.

**[00:38:56 - 00:39:02]** It is a bare, lifeless cell.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:19]** There's a fold out cot and a sonic shower and a very exhausted Android woman with red hair sitting on the ground.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:23]** Her arms are on your knees or not.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** Not yours.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:29]** Hers are, are on her knees is the first thing that she sees.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** Bernice?

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:36]** And again, it's just a briefcase with a pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:40]** The door opens on a briefcase for everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:48]** The door opens on a little robotic armature pointed at her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:51]** I love Bernice so much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** The door was heavy in opening.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:59]** Like you felt the wall shake.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** This is a meant to keep people in.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:12]** And as it opens, you hear a voice inside from this injured woman that says, what the is this?

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** Is that your turn?

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:17]** Yeah.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** I mean, can I do anything else?

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** I think that's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:28]** Well, you still have a standard action, and Bernice has a standard action, and you told her what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** I haven't said anything yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** You told her to shoot if something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** Shoot if something's unfriendly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Right.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:36]** So that's on you.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** No.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:39]** Not yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** Fair, fair, fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:46]** is going to be like, hey, what's going on here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** Okay.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** You're going to ask a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:54]** Are you being killed against your will?

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** Or are you one of them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** She responds.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:02]** I'll give her a response and then that will be that.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** She'll go.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:06]** Do you look around the corner?

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** No.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:09]** Okay.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:13]** Is this some sort of new intimidation tactic?

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** Because this is s***.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** Can I do sense motive?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:18]** You can sense motive if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** Yeah.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** Dr. O'Keefe is going to sense motive.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:23]** I got a 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:26]** 24 sense motive.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:31]** They seem like they are confused.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:40]** Also, this is somewhat expected and they seem confused and pissed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** Can I say anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:44]** Uh, think about it and we'll move on.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:46]** Does Bernice want to shoot or do anything else?

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:47]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** I'm joking.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:51]** You want to do anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:54]** Um, can I, can I cast a spell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:00]** Uh, I feel like your sense motive and the talking and all that was kind of taking place at that standard action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** Uh, so I don't think I can do anything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:05]** Okay.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** All right.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** You don't think you can do anything else?

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:07]** Okay.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** Wait, what spells do you have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** I got a couple spells.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** Okay.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** He's been known to have a couple.

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:18]** I got visited by Yorisa.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:22]** She taught me some spells.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:22]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** I got grave words.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** I don't have any spells.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:26]** Everybody else has spells.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** Okay.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:32]** Here's what do you want to do with your turn?

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** The door's been opened.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** Lots happening.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:35]** It's a tactical minefield.


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:35]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:44]** His has been incredibly useless because he's just been like waiting for, he's been doing these reaction sort of things, but can't react to anything.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:53]** So he still has his missiles out and he has like his hands like Spider-Man and he's just going to like kind of cross past Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** Fuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** Yeah, Kevin, you have a comment?

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** What's that?

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:33]** Sorry.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:43]** When you say, so the Android that he's shooting at now, is it the same image of like, is it a replicant of the Android that's in the closet?

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** Are they the same or they're different?

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:47]** They look different.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** Is this Kev asking?

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** This is Kevin asking, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Because that one might have been locked up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** I mean, I don't know if I want to answer.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:59]** Because you haven't, Rick hasn't seen, or if you're not going to act on it.

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:06]** saw the... Yeah, but I can't tell, like, I can't tell whether or not it's the same person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** It's an android with red hair.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:11]** Like, you would know somebody, like, wait, these look familiar.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** Like...

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:19]** And we know that Reptoids can replicate people, so to you, it should trigger in your mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:22]** I think Rick wouldn't have put that together yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:26]** No, Rick wouldn't have, but Dr. Oki is the one looking at her in the closet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:28]** I mean, I haven't looked in yet.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:30]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:33]** Don't you see what Bernice sees?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:36]** What did Bernice go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:40]** You've got to put on... I have to take a full...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Yeah.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:46]** It's a full action to correlate between two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:50]** I forget the name for it.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:53]** I either get a move or an attack.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:54]** Right.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:57]** And I can do full control.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:23]** or i can all i'm saying is that bernice was like you the two of you saw the android that was shooting at us and then you moved up and opened this door and now there's the other android may have pieced it together but um i don't think that she could articulate that within her within this six second round

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:24]** Okay, that's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:25]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** But I'm going to take it as a yes at this point.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** I think you're digging it the right way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** Yeah, go for it.

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** Have fun.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:38]** Okay.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:42]** Here, so you moved, you stepped down, and you were going to cast Magic Missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** We totally walked over each other.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:47]** Yeah, he kind of casts it, like, betwixt the legs of Rick19.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:49]** Because, you know, they're very accurate.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** It's not going to mess up his junk or whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:52]** Yeah.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** Mess up his junk.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:57]** Here's, what was your initiative again?

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:58]** Oh, damage.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:00]** Oh, my initiative was 10.

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** 10, yeah.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** Cool.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:05]** I just didn't see it here, but it's fine.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** All right, he's going to roll now.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** All right, help me.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:08]** Give me, like, one second.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** Okay.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** Give me that damage.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:11]** It flies through.

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:14]** The damage is... Seven.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:14]** Twelve.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:14]** Sorry, twelve.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Twelve damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** Twelve points of damage.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:18]** Okay.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:26]** And you hear a cry from behind that table as well as like a... Okay.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:28]** A cry and a... Yeah.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:32]** Okay, I'll take it.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:32]** Okay.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** I like it.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:33]** I like it.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:33]** I like it.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** I like it.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:39]** I like it Except not really top around three now Rick 19.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** What are you doing with your shirt?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:56]** Rick likes how call it works and he pushes the button to shut the door Readies a standard action to attack if it opens again you shut This is how I play video games sometimes


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** Okay.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:57]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** I think it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:03]** This is basically tabletop RPG camping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:05]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:08]** You are never allowed to make fun of me ever again.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:10]** Yeah, you've done it twice now.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:12]** You've done it twice now.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:13]** Yeah.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:14]** This is not true.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:16]** Tactical maneuvering is not.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** This is exactly what that is.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:21]** Tactical maneuvering is not running away, but Thaddeus is running away.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** Thaddeus is running away.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:36]** All right, so Rick 19 you shut the door it affects and ready a standard action to attack If the door opens if the door opens you will attack.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Oh shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:49]** I'm supposed to like change my initiative order Yeah, I Forgot but okay, we'll do that next time so if the door opens you will then change my mission and attack Yeah, okay.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:52]** All right Cool cool.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:52]** Cool

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** I hear you.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** This is what's going to happen.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** You wait for a second for a beat.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** Maybe things are tense.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:03]** You all are playing the camping game.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:06]** You're going to wait and see what happens when the door opens.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:08]** Understood.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:16]** The door opens again after a beat.

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** The wet salt has opened the door again.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Are you going to

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:23]** R-attack the Wetzelt?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:24]** R-attack?

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** What's R-attack?

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** Attack the Wetzelt.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:27]** Yes.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** Oh, I probably missed this time.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:32]** Five plus eight for 13 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** 13 does not hit.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** You mistimed it.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:36]** Yeah.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** Yeah.

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** Bummer.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** Bummer, bummer, bummer.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:41]** Okay.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:41]** Clank.

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:49]** Is the sound as a grenade soars past you.


## Speaker_0

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:51]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:59]** thrown by the female android who might or might not look like the android in the cell.

**[00:48:59 - 00:48:59]** Who knows?

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:03]** I'm pretty sure there's a feat for soldiers so you can pick it up and throw it back.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** You should take that feat, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** Perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:13]** I need Hears and Rick to give me a fortitude saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** That's my best one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:17]** A fortitude saving throw.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** Eighteen.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Fortitude.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** Eighteen.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:22]** Eight.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:23]** Eight.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:27]** Yeah.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:34]** This green, yellow, brown gas just starts to fill your nostrils.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** And I hit you not.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:40]** It is the worst smell that you have ever smelled in your life.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:41]** Just a stink bomb.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:48]** And then it starts to settle on the ground as you've been hit with a stinking goo grenade.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:54]** And this area that I have highlighted here is now difficult terrain.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:56]** So moving through it will be at half speed.

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:00]** And then... Ooh, ooh, this is good.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:06]** This is... Here's for four rounds.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:08]** Okay.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:09]** You are nauseated.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:13]** Uh, crazy.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** My least favorite thing.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:15]** Yeah.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Okay, so what does that mean?

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** I'm going to look that up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:26]** For the class, and for those keeping track at home, nauseated, you are experiencing stomach distress.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:33]** You cannot attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:38]** The only action you can take is a single move action per turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** Holy .

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:43]** That's literally the second worst thing after exhausted, I think is what it is.

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:45]** It literally nerfs everything.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:48]** That's an insane thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:52]** Yeah, this is a level two stinking goo grenade.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:54]** Rick passed, so he doesn't have any of that.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:57]** You got an 18, so you're okay.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** Okay.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:59]** You are okay for now.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** Here's for four rounds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:02]** He starts retching onto Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:05]** He starts throwing up on his body.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** It is not good.

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:09]** It is not good at all.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:17]** I'm going to update the... Because both you and that moved, so they're going to move in initiative order on top of you.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:20]** Okay.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:20]** Okay.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:21]** Okay.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:22]** Okay.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** I like this.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:27]** The Wetzel is then going to reach out and attack you, Rick19.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:32]** Sorry, so my initiative... The Wetzel opened the door and threw a grenade?

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** No, the Wetzel didn't throw a grenade.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:36]** The other person, ready to action?

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** Ready to action, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** Smart, that's the case.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** But yeah, obviously...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:46]** Yeah, that is a 20 against KCDH.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** That's a meat beats.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:49]** That's a meat beats?

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** Wait, is there anything?

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:50]** What the hell is that?

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:54]** Yeah, that's meat beats.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Meat beats.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:58]** That's 11 points of slashing damage as it slices into you.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** Things are getting a little sticky.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:01]** Literally.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** 11 points, you said?

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** 11 points of damage.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** It's only six.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** That's three times per day.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** Okay.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** It's five times per day.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** Five times per day.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:16]** We are in round three, right?

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** So let me adjust that.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:19]** Cool.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** Okay.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:23]** It is Colin Edenbrand's turn.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:24]** The door did not open.

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** What do you do?

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** I think he kicks it open.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** He kicks open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:35]** I'm assuming it's on a hinge or like there's a button.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** It slides.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:38]** Nothing happens.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:43]** You kick the sliding door and it just reverberates and you like break your ankle.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:48]** No, you kick the, you kick the button and the button opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:53]** And I see frog person on the other side of the door.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:58]** You do.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:00]** And when that happens, you know what happens?

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** What happens?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:02]** A ready to action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:06]** There is a ready to action.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** And they should not... Apologies.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** They should not have been that far.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** They should have been five feet in front.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** Cool.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:16]** Yep.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:21]** There is an attack as an apprehension class capture pull.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:27]** Slams forward.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:29]** And I just rolled...

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:37]** a natural two on the die so there's no way that it hits you at all it slams into the wall

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:41]** Such a waste of a f***ing reaction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:55 - 00:54:00]** He turned it and the head of the pole is stuck because there's a narrow gap.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:23]** He lets the heater blow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** Bangs, he says.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** Bangs.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:31]** Oh, wow.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** That is 11 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:41]** 11 for a total of?

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** Bing!

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** It flies off the wall.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** It doesn't hit.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:59]** That was their turn.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:02]** They moved in front of you, right?

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:04]** So they moved in initiative order.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:08]** Because they readied to act right before you.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** I'm pretty sure.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:10]** Okay.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:33]** That's a good way to test whether or not they're a Reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:36]** Dr. K, there is a smile that comes across their face.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:42]** And you think this is perhaps the first smile that they've given in a long time.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** In a minute.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:48]** What else do you want to do with your turn, Dr. K?

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:07]** Is it, is it a disease or is it, it's just, it's a condition.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:07]** It's a condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** It's a condition.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:10]** It's a condition where you can't do.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:10]** Yeah.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:11]** Okay.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** Except move.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:24]** Yeah.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** So then you,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:32]** And it's difficult terrain, so your movement is... Well, it's five feet for that first move, and then you have a full movement afterwards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:35]** Or it's half your speed for... Can he...

**[00:57:35 - 00:58:01]** yeah concentration means he can't heal himself or remove the condition i imagine either right right you can't so he's good he does know the doctor okays uh the doctor feel good though so just in case he's gonna see if he might be able to get something from him he's gonna talk he can do that i'm sure so he's like crawling out of like this green goo kind of thing and he's like like throwing up like just a trail of like i mean it's a bug let's say like purple horrible
