**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** It's not a fan question.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:13]** What is your skincare routine?

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** I feel like we talked about this.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:53]** I'm with you on that.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:56]** I don't have a loofah, but I use the same body washes.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** And I don't even have a specific body wash.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:02]** It's just whatever body wash my wife has in the shower.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** I'm like, okay, that's the one I'm using.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Oh, you don't have your body wash.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** You just use hers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:08]** Wow, that is the wild west.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:09]** I don't know about that.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:10]** Yeah, that's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:13]** It's either usually about cucumber this or honey that.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** And I'm like, okay, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Dude, I mean, it does smell good, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** And that goes on my face and everything else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:19]** Come out smelling like a whole snack.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** Like a whole snack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:22]** Graham cracker.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** Yummy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:23]** Yep.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:26]** Will, I feel like I see you ready to go.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:40]** I mean, it's really, it's quite embarrassing that I'm just as, um, you know, guilty of basically stealing off my wife, whatever her skincare is.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:40]** No shame, man.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** No shame.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:43]** Um, I have bar soap.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:45]** Okay.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:49]** Um, I do the squash and then, um,

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:58]** I do occasionally I'll use like an exfoliating face wash.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** And then... Which Squatch is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** Squatch.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** I love the Pintar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:04]** It's a good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** Yeah.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:12]** And occasionally I'll get like...

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:19]** My wife is into Korean beauty products, and so... Oh, yeah.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:22]** You know, she's like, let's put on masks.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** I'm not going to say no.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** Dude, the masks feel so good.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** They feel good, man.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** I get it.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** Masks slap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** Dude, masks slap real hard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:34]** I really like the gold foil under eye masks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** Oh, yeah, dude.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:36]** Those are good.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** I've never done one of those.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:38]** Oh, dude.

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:42]** It's so cool, like right under your eye because it reduces the puffiness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:43]** Yeah.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** You know?

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:45]** It's so nice.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:52]** I was in Fort Walton at a volleyball tournament, and Alyssa wasn't feeling good, so she went to bed.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:56]** I was up with the rest of her team as a women's beach volleyball team.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** And so I'm just like, it.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:03]** Pop some wine, and they taught me how to do a face mask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:04]** Killer, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:04]** It was a good time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:05]** What kind of mask did you do?

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Was it clay?

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** Was it just one of the sheets that you just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:30]** was one of the sheets it was a two-piece sheet uh there was a top half and a bottom oh yeah yeah it was the neutrogeno like moisturizer one yeah and like i put both of them on but i have too much hair on the bottom of my face that's the one thing the bottom yeah wouldn't adhere right so like i just had like the batman face mask here's the thing sure aren't made for people with facial hair

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** No, they're not.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** I actually have one.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:35]** Should I put a face mask on for this episode?

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** Is that the move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:39]** Next episode.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** To do that, you've got to start doing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:46]** One of these days, I'll do gold foil under a mask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** I'm down.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:50]** I think we should have a skincare app.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:54]** I think we should do face masks and PJs for plot armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:54]** Oh, dude, I'm down.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:58]** Book three plot armors, PJs, and put on some comfortable pajamas.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** Yeah.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** That sounds nice.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:02]** That'd be cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:05]** Kelly, what about you?

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:11]** Well, I do use something called Tretinoin, which is a vitamin A derivative.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:11]** I use that at nighttime.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:16]** And then during the day, I'll put on a hyaluronic acid thing.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:19]** Then I'll put some moisturizer on top of that.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:22]** And then I wear sunscreen as much as I can.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** That's good.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** That's something I don't do enough of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:29]** Yeah, the highest possible SPF.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** It's really crucial.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:33]** This is why I'm a ghost.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:39]** Actually, studies have shown that anything over 50 is not any more effective.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:47]** But also, US-made sunscreen is trash.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** Garbage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** Australian ones are some of the best ones.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** Not all US-made.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:53 - 00:08:09]** sure sure not commercially available yeah yeah but it's like it's so much easier in other countries to get good skin care or good like sunscreen also i would say if you're gonna wear sunscreen and you're gonna go in the water make sure you get a um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:29]** marine life safe sunscreen because um you know they'll tell you this in like hawaii and stuff but you really shouldn't anymore uh yeah that's there's no need for it's like an extra buck maybe yeah it's worth it to protect the marine life not


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:54]** yeah this is new information for me so like is is sunscreen harmful to marine life and we come from the land of get something like this sometimes natural sunscreen yeah that's really good oh natural reef safe reef friendly reef friendly i like that okay this is good to know especially for if you're gonna go yeah that's very good to know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:59]** I wear a lot of it because I have had skin cancer underneath my eye.

**[00:08:59 - 00:08:59]** That was not fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:02]** If you're covered really well, I completely forgot.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** Because you can't tell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:04]** Thank you.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:05]** I appreciate that.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:08]** You did have a cool scar for a minute, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** I did.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:10]** You didn't wear an eye patch.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:12]** No, I thought about it.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** I thought about it.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:19]** Then you can still see the scar, so then it would look like, oh, I could have been like a villain that Halloween.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:21]** Who's a villain with a scar?


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:17]** And then Taco Monk seconded that.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** And then John thirded it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:22]** What's the name of the channel?

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** Is it UFC?

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:33]** Nope.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** Sounds good.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:39]** I think this is even funnier if, if Benny does it and Kelly also shows us his gritty.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:43]** Cause once you throw down the challenge, you got to go, you got to go bar for bar.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** I'll go gritty for gritty.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** Okay, great.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:45]** Yeah.

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:45]** All right.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:46]** I'll do it.

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** I'll do it.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:47]** Okay.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:47]** Okay.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** So not episode one, two, three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:54]** Do I need to get on a plane so we can do this in person or like, Oh, what's the move here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:58]** Maybe the next like a convention when we all meet up.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** That's okay.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:00]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** Should I mean like, isn't, isn't gritty from Pennsylvania?


## Speaker_0

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:05]** Well, that's the Gritty I'm going to do.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** Y'all don't even know.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:08]** But Vinny is going to do the Gritty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** That's what I want to see.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:12]** I'm unfamiliar with the Pennsylvania Gritty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** Specifically the Pennsylvania Gritty.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** The Philadelphia Flyers.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:18]** Gritty is the Philadelphia Flyer.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:19]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:19]** Mascot.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** He truly embodies the spirit of Philadelphia.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:25]** He's like the weird monster that had a bunch of snacks in his beard.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** Is he the green one?

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** The orange one.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** The orange one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** Okay.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** All right.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** Well, challenge accepted.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:38]** There's going to be a gritty off at the next convention between Vinny and Kelly.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:39]** Cool.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:40]** You better start practicing.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:41]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** You better start practicing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** I'll start practicing the gritty.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:46]** I've never seen it before, but... Well, you have time.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** Kelly, do you dance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:49]** Yeah.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:49]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:50]** That's a good question.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** Do you dance at all, Kelly?

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:53]** It's... Have you ever seen what I dance for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:58]** The hammer guy from like... What's it called?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** From like Mario?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:00]** No.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** What?

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:04]** Have you ever seen... No, no, no.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:04]** What's his name?

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:06]** Justin Hammer from Iron Man?

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:07]** That's how I dance.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:14]** Which is hilarious because I love Mark Rockwell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:16]** He's talking about Iron Man too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** Yeah, Mark Rockwell's character.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** Justin Hammer is such a tool bag.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:26]** But Mark Rockwell is a really amazing human.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** Sam Rockwell's great, yeah.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:29]** Sam Rockwell is.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:31]** He doesn't dress well.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:33]** He doesn't dance well in the movie.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:33]** That's the entire point.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:38]** Also, Vinny, I did, but I did not mean to upset you so much with my comment.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:42]** But if it gets you to gritty, then I'm happy with it.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** That's all I got to say because I want to see it.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** I've just been waiting.

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:45]** Oh, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:50]** I mean, if you want this smoke, you're going to catch the smoke.

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:50]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** You just got to get ready to dance as well.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** If the smoke comes from your heels.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:59]** As long as you can dance as well as your favorite actor in your favorite movie, Spider-Man 3, where Tobey Maguire dances.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:01]** That's actually how I dance.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** That's why I like this movie.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:10]** If the Olympics has taught me anything, anyone can break dance.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** It's how to dance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** Anyone can break dance.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:13]** You're not wrong, Will.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:17]** With that, I want to give a quick shout out to our partner, Siren Skate.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** You guys are fantastic.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:54]** That one guy that was dating that one MILF, he's now dating another MILF.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:56]** And I just want to congratulate him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:58]** I don't know what's happening in this part of our Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:02]** I am not aware of this.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:04]** Yeah, he was dating a MILF.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** But then she...

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:28]** it just like it didn't work out this can happen a lot of the time with like age gap relationships with like sure so then like the uh but it just didn't it didn't work so then now he's dating another milf so but what channel is this tm yeah dude what's going on yeah i just i'm gonna call him like

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:48]** milf hunter now and because i can't reveal his name but i well i was gonna use some more and more nsfw term but i think that's probably fine uh and then uh yeah i i feel like you've uh i just wanted i just stay stay stay happy man stay i do have a question though is is that like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:48 - 00:16:06]** is that like his preferred yeah for sure is that a preference of women older older women that have children or they might just not have children so maybe it's not technically a bill you can't be a milf unless you have children otherwise that's a definitely bird


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:08]** By definition, childless?

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** Is that what you're saying?

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:13]** No, I think it's squares and rectangles.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:17]** I think a cougar is an aggressive... All milfs are cougars, but not all cougars are milfs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** Not all milfs are cougars.

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:23]** I feel like there's an episode title in here somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:40]** i feel like the cooker also implies that like they're the ones doing the hunting that like they're right well i feel like you know they're aggressive you're right it's it's a it's actually not overlap or completely overlapping right circle the venn diagram is not a circle this is that are said for the first time


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** Brand new sentence.

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:42]** Thank you.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** Yeah, this feels like a brand new sentence thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:47]** I feel like this argument's been had by a million people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:51]** I feel like we should have this argument in the Discord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** I think so as well.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:57]** Tell us the definition of Coopermilfs.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** Also, give us the same for men.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:03]** I don't know what the... There's Dilfs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:07]** Yeah, there's Dilfs, but I don't know what the... And Perverts would be the other one, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:10]** That's called a predator.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:10]** Yeah.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:12]** Oh, those are called daddies, actually, is what it is, I think.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:13]** So then, there you go.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:19]** With a capital Z. I guess it's the same with a Z. Yeah, with a Z. A zaddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:20]** A zaddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** Yeah, that's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:23]** Call them Belichicks now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** Yeah, that's... Ooh.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** That's a good one.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** That's a good one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:30]** That's a good New England reference.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** That's sports ball.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** You'll figure it out later.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:35]** He's like 75 and dating a 24-year-old.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:50]** If you have banter topics at home that you think we should talk about, such as are all Mills, Cougars, or Zaddies, or Bill Belichick, you can join our coffee and give us some suggestions for what to banter about.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:53]** So check that out, coffee.willsaythepodcast.com.

**[00:17:54 - 00:18:16]** yeah do it do it just do it all right do it do it do it do it well are we uh are we cleared maybe we'll play i guess so cleared to play are we cleared to play let's do the thing let's do the dang bang do do the thing the darn thing uh okay cool cool cool

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:23]** I want to start somewhere because again, we're, we're post app one 50.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:25]** So things are, things are different now.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** So I want to start somewhere else.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:34]** So like we've been keeping with all the previous episodes, I'd like you guys to close your eyes.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:48]** We open on a sleek, modern and minimalist kitchen that is expansive and

**[00:18:50 - 00:19:05]** One wall is artfully arranged with spotless state-of-the-art appliances, while the other wall is crystal clear floor-to-ceiling windows that look out over picturesque Nyori Palisades and Jatembe Park.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:15]** The golden hour has ended and twilight is fading into Absalom Station's stunning starry skies.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:26]** When we hear the sound of voices slowly trickling in, a door opens in another room along this open layout.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:34]** And there's the sound of the end of a conversation as everyone is happy to be together, but also relieved to be home.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:54]** Colin Edenbrand first walks around the corner dressed in his favorite dark blue outfit, a naval blue turtleneck sweater, tastefully bordered at the neck and cuffs with real white castravelian flowers on top of form-fitting tan pants.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:57]** Overmatching fashionably blue sneakers.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:57]** Classic.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:09]** Behind him, moments later, is a magnificent older human woman in a stylish black dress, brown hair, styled straight and long.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:11]** Right?

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:18]** Against her purple coat already sliding off her shoulders to land over a chair.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:22]** This cougar is named Edith Edenbrandt.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:37]** Next to her, strolling in just a step behind, is a very finely put-together older gentleman, clean-cut face, cropped hair, over a black button-down, under a quality black suit, all black, all business.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** This is Connor Edenbrand.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** There's kind of a silence.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:48]** As conversation ends, people shift, Collins opening the fridge, and Edith checks her phone.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:52]** Dad, do you want some water?

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:56]** Edith looks over at Connor, who is not looking at her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** No, no, quite all right.

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:01]** Hey, it's fine, it's fine, I'm fine.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:07]** We didn't finish the conversation at dinner about your next steps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:11]** Maybe let's try to find some common sense together here.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:22]** Colin slowly sips his water, knowing this might have been coming, and thinking through the myriad of things to say before landing on perhaps the savviest one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:25]** Now the conversation was over.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** I'm joining humanitarian aid for Akaton.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:31]** They'll place me where the need is greatest.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** This will look good for our state.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** Think of the headlines and the charities we can donate to.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:41]** All leaders, especially second generation, need to have a humble start to solidify their public image.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:46]** I can't lead in healthcare without bringing care to those who need it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:51]** Again, Edith looks over at Connor, who is looking at her.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:59]** I know you've been off at school, so maybe you haven't seen a great deal of what's happened.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:02]** That's partially by design.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:05]** So there's nothing wrong with your thinking.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:08]** That's exactly how our son should think.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:11]** Except that you're too short-sighted.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:13]** And that comes with time and experience.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:17]** Our money is shielded from public image in this way.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:19]** People will use our care regardless.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** Here, just walk with me.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:23]** Come on through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:30]** And as Colin and Connor walk out of the room, Edith opens up a new message on her phone and begins typing.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** But we can't see to who or what she's saying.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:44]** Connor leads Colin through several finely curated hallways, a bit of a maze, into a back office and shuts the heavy wooden door with finality.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:53]** Dark green walls reject all light and warmth as this room looks out mostly onto the edges of Absalom Station.

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:01]** Dock lights blinking as the workers on shipping lanes are surrounded by the inky blackness of space.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:03]** All the better for privacy.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:14]** There's a soft blue light that comes up as Connor brings up a hollow emitter of accounts co-located with their companies across the packed worlds.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:17]** The galaxy sits before Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:23]** This is the majority of our holdings, maybe many more than you know.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:28]** And I'm going to skip over the details because you'll get this in your onboarding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:31]** Connor continues to zoom out.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:38]** The circle of planets grows exponentially even as the emitter zooms to adjust to the scale.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:44]** These are our near-space investments, and important to you right now for one reason alone.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** This is the reach of the Eden-Brand name.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:52]** Break Vesk Prime, Babak, a few other industry-heavy planets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** Connor zooms out one more time.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** The vast.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:02]** And this time only a single light shows up, right in front of Connor's face, Colin's face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:07]** This is the home of our newest client.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:12]** They are quite zealous, and we've got our first meeting in two weeks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:17]** You need my faith to look good for us.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:22]** Connor gives him a little sharp smile.

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** He knows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** Delay your leave two months and help.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** Do this, and then you can leave for Akiton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:32]** Your mother and I are agreed on this.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:38]** Colin kind of sighs, knowing this is probably not just this meeting.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:42]** But then his phone lights up with a notification.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:46]** Owen is already on Akiton, that a**hole.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:51]** Not only had to fight for valedictorian, but also has to fight for philanthropy.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:58]** But maybe if this buys his parents' attention, and then he can escape somewhere else, he'll think about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** Send me the summary.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** Let's chat tomorrow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** Connor says nothing as Colin walks out.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:17]** And then Connor turns to watch the inky stars start to appear, shining with early starlight.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:24]** And after a minute, we hear the front door open and then close.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:29]** And then another minute later, Edith walks into the back office.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:32]** Will he do it?

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:33]** Of course.

**[00:25:35 - 00:25:36]** Does he know?

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:41]** Thinks he's just on the hook for one or three meetings.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:43]** Owen's picture was a nice touch, you know.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** He owes me several favors.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:51]** Look, we need Colin at the meeting and off Akaton for a few months.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:53]** Then he can do what he wants until it's time to start.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:56]** Let's talk meeting strategy.

**[00:25:57 - 00:25:59]** Connor just says nothing and steps up to the window.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:04]** He may hate us for this one day.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:11]** We are securing his and others' pages in the history books.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** He is an extension of us.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** He will understand in time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:32]** She walks up, puts her arm around Connor's, and they both turn to watch as all the beautiful stars around Absalom Station reveal themselves as if to signal the galaxy's approval of the Eden brand's plan.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:43]** And we come back to the present time.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:47]** A little taste of Colin a long time ago.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** Thoughts of Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:50]** Taste of Colin.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** Taste of Colin was good.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:53]** Had a bouquet of nostalgia.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** A bouquet of nostalgia.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** That's nice.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** And pressure from family.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** Yeah.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:02]** Pure pressure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:09]** So the Eden brand name is synonymous with care.

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:12]** Are there pharmaceuticals?

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** What is their medicine?

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** We don't know what their company is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:19]** Yeah, they make pharmaceutical devices.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** They make medical devices.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:23]** They also have branches that provide care.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:33]** They also have pharmaceutical... They have parts of the family that are involved in every phase of medical care.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** Okay, okay.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:55]** bit of a conglomerate but it's yeah but they they're using colin they're like manipulating him yeah well his parents are manipulating him this is what like how do you feel about this video yeah uh yeah this is like just finished medical school


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:55 - 00:28:19]** yeah man so would their name be like my my sense was that their their name is maybe synonymous with like i don't know is it like johns hopkins or like mayo or yeah cedar sinai like i was feeling like mayo mayo okay all right yeah big players yeah yeah is this the first we've heard of owen


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** I'm sure it's not the last.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** Is it?

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:22]** Is it?

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** It might be.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** Okay.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:26]** I don't remember hearing the name before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Yeah.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** I'm sure you'll hear it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** Sure, you'll hear it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:39]** I'm curious, that single dot in front of Colin's face, would he have recognized where that was in the galaxy?

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:42]** It was in the vast, they said.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:42]** It was in the vast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:43]** Probably not.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:47]** The vast is pretty vast.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:56]** Probably not offhand, but thank you, Will.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:57]** Nailed it.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:57]** Nailed it.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Nailed it.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** All right, well.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:09]** pending any other healthcare questions for the resident doctor, uh, Eden brand, not the doctor of science necessarily, but very overlap.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:10]** Cougar milf, same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:11]** Kelly, you raise your hand.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:12]** Oh no.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:15]** I mean, yeah, it turned out that the milf was his literal mom.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** So we're going to take that back.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:22]** But then like, uh, the moment where you said, Colin can have a hot mom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:24]** That's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:25]** Oh, no, let's save you from this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:54]** i'll be the judge of that we gotta see like a token of his mom but like um we need some art of his mom yeah yeah i really like the line stifler's mom from american pie is that jennifer cool you have not seen american pie that's a closet no i think it is jennifer coolidge yeah oh jennifer cool just hilarious by the way she's an amazing actress

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** Should we go back?

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** Terrapin Station?

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** You want to see what happens?

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** Do we find out?

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:24]** Find a fucking Dragonoid?

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** Nah, it's cool.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** We just don't.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:28]** Dragonoid.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:30]** Sounds like a Pokemon.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:32]** Yeah, it's like Optimus Prime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:36]** Dragonoid!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:36]** Dragoneer!

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:37]** Dragoneer!

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:39]** Kevin's never seen Pokemon, but I love how he just laughs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** I was real big on the 151.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:44]** Everything after that, I don't give a shit about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:44 - 00:30:44]** Yeah.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:46]** I was in middle school.

**[00:30:46 - 00:31:01]** He was probably closer to the school was in a submarine That's like the captain's stateroom right three people I

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** Yeah, kicked him out.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:05]** Yeah, you just shot him out of a torpedo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:10]** Yeah, I mean, it's a common misnomer that the Beatles came up with it, but it was actually Kevin's middle school song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** We all live in the Yellow Submarine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:16]** Because he lived in an underwater submarine cult.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:20]** Oh my god, so I shared my screen.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:28]** I don't often turn on my camera for my co-workers, but one of my co-workers, I was showing her my dog and my daughter, and she saw my dinosaur.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:29]** I was like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:41]** Activated you guys back to Terrapin station.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:44]** We are back in the hall for your freedom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:49]** You love what I love the blood splatter over every token except the dragon That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:54]** The blood splatter is a great mod for foundry It's super good

**[00:31:54 - 00:32:01]** Dr. Nodens and Orvier Pike, the architects of your isolation and imprisonment and pain are dead.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:01]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Question.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:04]** About the blood splatter.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** Yeah.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:08]** It's just you click it and it turns on blood splatter?

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** Yeah.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** Because each of the blood splatters are different.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** They're randomized.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** Yeah, it's cool.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:15]** It's this mod, and then I added that to my hotkey.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:18]** I can also add one... You can hotkey blood splatters?

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:21]** Yeah, so if I go to Orvier, I can also do flames.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:23]** Like, he's on fire now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:26]** Why don't you do that one for burning?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:27]** I just want his burning corpse to...

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:31]** Um, on, on Dr. Nodens, you can add like a wispy thing.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** So like blur when there's like blur.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:37]** Oh, actually maybe I should add that onto, uh, the dragon.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:44]** Because if you recall last time you learned that there was some sort of, you know, this is like an experimental dragon from Dr. Nodens.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** And I believe Dr. Okay.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:54]** Notice that it had some sort of like concealment that when you're attacking from range, but maybe up close, you wouldn't have it.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:55]** Interesting.


## Speaker_0

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:58]** We ended last time, though, with here's his turn.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** This feels like beer goggles.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:02]** It's a little beer goggly.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** I can take it off if it's going to make you sick because you're drinking it.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** Yeah, that one's kind of weird.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** But the on fire one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** I'm drinking whiskey, so beer goggles don't affect me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:12]** Well, I'm going to turn off the one on Dr. Newton's because she is just dead.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:14]** She's just dead.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** We ended last time.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:20]** We're at the almost tail end, the bottom of round eight.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:27]** Here's Fabricius firing off the magic missiles that are attacking or that hit Dr. Nodens.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** Was that a full attack?

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** Do you have anything left?

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** Yeah, it was a full attack.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:33]** No, I've been doing those full attacks.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** He's been doing them full attacks.

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** The safety of doing them full attacks.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:38]** Okay.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** I like it.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:39]** I like it.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** All right.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:47]** Next thing's next effector rounding out the end of the bang.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** She is going to move.

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:57]** I believe seeing the dragon come out and being the closest to it because Bernice is pretty much dead.

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:18]** yeah she's down she's like dusted cooked quite literally 15 feet away so she's going to move uh 10 feet and basically run down towards you dr okay she's gonna move 20 feet uh and dr k is gonna be like why didn't you bring my briefcase oh i'm sorry you're right you're right you're right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:20]** So she runs back.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:24]** I'll go back and get you next time.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** Uses double action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** All right.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:27]** I'll move again.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** I swear.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:29]** That's fine.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:37]** So she is going to she moved 30 feet and then she's going to take a shot off at the dragon.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:40]** And we will see what happens to the dragon.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** She's going to roll.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:42]** See what I get.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:48]** Wow, that was very close to a crit.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:51]** Not gonna lie, that was incredibly close to a crit.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** But it was not one, unfortunately.

**[00:34:54 - 00:34:55]** That was a 19 on the die.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:59]** And then she's using the...

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Needler, I believe.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:06]** So that is 10 points of damage.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:07]** I barely know her.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:09]** What's the range on the Needler?

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:09]** 40.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:11]** Okay.

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:12]** She is 40.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:18]** No, no, she's 40 feet away right now.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:21]** She's exactly 40 feet away, but she still would have hit.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** Minus 30.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** Yours is 30?

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** So then she's one increment away.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** So it's another minus two.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:27]** But she still hits.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:28]** It's okay.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:29]** Yeah, she still hits because she got an A10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:30]** As long as you account for that.

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** I'm just following the rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** I appreciate it.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:34]** Is it the tactical needle or the pistol?

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** It was the tackler.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** I think you gave her the tackler.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** Oh, cool.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** The tackler needle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** So I just have a shitty pistol.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:40]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** I think you just have a really bad pistol.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** Let's see.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** Okay.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** Here's...

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:23]** Okay.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** All good.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:07]** So, you were shaken, I believe, for seven rounds, which is rough.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** Good lord.

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Okay.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:09]** Yeah, rough.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** Rough, rough, rough.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:11]** Only seven.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** It is top of round nine.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** It's the dragon's turn.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:18]** Here's the thing here, Fabricius.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** You killed its mom.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:21]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** No, we didn't.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Nodens was his mommy.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** Nodens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:26]** You did.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:27]** You did do that.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:28]** Sorry.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:28]** I'm sorry, dude.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** I am so sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:35]** You can correct it and say your mom is actually a giant red dragon that is on its way.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:39]** Let's sell that to this dragon and tell them that.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** I think he is.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:40]** Oh, shit.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:41]** Why is it coming towards me?

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Right.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** Why is it coming to me?

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:45]** I feel like John just answered that question.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** Here shuts the door.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** Here shuts the door.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** You can't.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:50]** It's not your turn, buddy.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:51]** It's not your turn, dude.

**[00:37:52 - 00:37:53]** As a reaction.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** As a reaction.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:56]** If you don't know that I had this reaction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:59]** That's a crazy feat.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:02]** Literally, you can take a free action to shut doors.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** It's with his little free hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:06]** His little, like, man hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** Yeah, right.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:09]** He uses his crazy feet to shut the door.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** His crazy feet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** Yeah.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:16]** He just gritties away.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:18]** Here's does have a gritty.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Kelly does not.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:20]** Here's one.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** Okay.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Oh, 19 on the die.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:25]** Okay.

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:27]** What's that for?

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:30]** That's the claw to attack you.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** The claw.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** The claw that swings at you.

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:35]** The claw!

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:39]** 13 points of damage as the claw comes through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:44]** I saw a guy today wearing a planet... Oh my god, what's the name of it called?

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:46]** Yeah, Pizza Planet t-shirt.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** I was like, that is awesome.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:50]** Anyways, it's a Pizza Planet delivery guy or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** Anyways.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** That would be cool.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** Yeah, he takes damage.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** Yes, he does take damage.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:00]** He takes 13 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:01]** Yep, 13 points of damage.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:07]** Okay, Dr. Okay, what are you doing as this creature is attacking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:13]** Yeah, I'm going to look for a way to open the hangar.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:15]** Way to open the hangar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:16]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:18]** All right.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:19]** I love it.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:22]** We had the same idea at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** Okay, I like it.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** I like it.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:31]** Yeah, there is a space off to your right.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** Sweet.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:38]** Yeah, it's pretty easy to tell that these are the areas where you can open the hangar.

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:40]** Oh, Bernice did not move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:43]** She's just currently selected with me.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:45]** Because she can't.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:45]** Yeah, because she can't.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** That's fine.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** Because she's down.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:48]** She's not dead.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** She is down.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** Nope.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Shut up, clearly labeled controls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** Hey, right here.

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:56]** Do you want to open the hanger?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** Hanger opening button.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** I'm going to open the hanger.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** Do I need a computer's check or anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:05]** You do not need a computer's check in order to open it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** It's just a push button.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** And then it opens.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:13]** And then can we call out to Rudy and be like, we found your

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** what they've done to your egg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:17]** Rudy's the bounty hunter, I thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:21]** Yeah, Rudy's... What's the dragon's name?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** Varignias.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:23]** I was close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:26]** I was going to say Varos.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Varignias.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** Where's Rudy, though?

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:30]** I vote for him to come back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:32]** Yo, we hit that button a hot minute ago.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:36]** What a useless in case of emergency break.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:38]** I think he's going to like Kool-Aid man through a wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** This is the thing.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:43]** The dragon's actually going to be useful and not Rudy.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:45]** He's going to be like, well, I actually have useful after all.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:48]** And then he'll like, she'll solve the problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:51]** No, Rudy's going to show up right as we're leaving.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** Oh, that was a crazy fight.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:54]** I'm really impressed.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:54]** You guys.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:57]** I'm really glad that you guys are good to go.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:57]** Hey, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:58]** You need any help?

**[00:40:58 - 00:40:59]** I'm here now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:01]** I feel useless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:02]** Okay.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Yeah.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:08]** Rudy's the buddy that shows up after everything's moved and just drinks your beer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:12]** I understand your opinions about Rudy.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** I have a real reason why Rudy is not here yet.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** So you should call it.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:17]** Doctor.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** God, he's dead.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** Yeah, he's dead.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:27]** I'm calling to grab Newton's data pad and see if they can assuage this beast.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** And I'll be clever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:32]** Clever girl.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** Clever girl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:36]** Computer check since I don't think they have computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:45]** Train, okay, I do have some computers Is the door open now the doors open the doors are open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:47]** Can we signal Viriginia?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:50]** What do you want to do to signal for goodness?

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:52]** I mean you probably can but are you blowing an air horn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:54]** What are you doing?

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:57]** I'll shoot


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:11]** something in the air maybe you'll shoot something in the air she didn't give us any like calling card did she nope she said i'll be watching oh cool yeah that's all that's all she said she said i'll be watching uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:15]** Yeah, I don't think I can do it in this turn.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:19]** I don't want to shoot my costa jet into the air because... That's fair.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:19]** It's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:23]** But I have a sonic murmur pistol.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:24]** Ooh.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** So I feel like that would make noise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** So I'll pull that out next turn.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** Okay.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** Pull it out next turn and fire it.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:31]** Cool.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:33]** Doors are open.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** I like this.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:38]** Going to note here that the doors are open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:52]** colin edenbrand what you're on deck what are you going to do with your turn um colin picks up notan's data pad but has it like upside down and can't figure out how to do anything with it okay um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** So he gets mad and throws it on the ground and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:56 - 00:42:59]** Right, just like chucks it toward Rick and Tim.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** Yeah, yeah, totally, totally.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:03]** He has no computers at all.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:04]** He has none.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:05]** Okay.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:05]** Nope.

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:14]** So I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to cast a zero level spell, sometimes referred to as a cantrip.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** Sometimes.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:17]** Not often.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** I like to call it that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:23]** I'm going to take a step over yonder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:25]** Over thither.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:27]** Where is thither?

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** Presumably toward the door.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:33]** The door that is pretty much starting to open now.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:35]** So then you're going to jump off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Great.

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** So I'm going to cast Glowing Wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** What is that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:45]** So I can...

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** I want to read it.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:50]** So a barrier of light color as you choose springs into existence.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:55]** You form the wall into a vertical or horizontal plane, but each 10 foot square must join another.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** Um,

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** I can create up to eight 10-foot squares.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:10]** So, like, I'm just going to make an 80-foot tall flashing column of red light to, like, signal Varignias.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** Actually, no.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:21]** I'm going to take eight squares and shape them into a V. Just like... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** To signal for Varignias to come here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:24]** Okay.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:27]** You have, you should have drawing tools available on your left.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:29]** So you can draw that now if you would like to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** Um, I sure.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:33]** I don't know that I can draw that in the third dimension.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:37]** I know you can't, you can just draw it dry.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:37]** Yeah.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:37]** Yeah.

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Just, yeah, that's fine.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** Or just, just put it in two dimensions.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:41]** It's fine.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** Amazing.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:42]** Okay.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:44]** So you walk over closer to the edge.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** You're like, wow, that's a big drop.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:49]** I'm going to just cast this, this huge V to come by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:55]** Yeah, that that yeah, dude nice V good good V there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:57]** Yeah, that was me, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:01]** Yeah, it's a white chief.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:02]** I Know I don't know how to make it.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:15]** Yeah change colors Yeah, I think you double click on it and then you you have to go into the thing and yeah change it make it red now There's just a lot of illustrations happening on the founder map right now.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** This is great.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** I love this a lot This is great

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** So you're calling for Virignus.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:25]** Do you want to do anything else with your turn, Colin Edenburn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** I think that's it.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:35]** I've moved, I've casted a spell, and I've presumably also interacted with an object.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:36]** Okay.

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Okay.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** Sounds good.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:43]** It is Rick and 18's turn.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** What are you doing now, Rick?

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:45]** He's run over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** I cannot recall my status.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** Am I still prone?

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** And I know I'm deafened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:54]** You're prone and deafened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:57]** So when I'm unconscious and then return, that doesn't...

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:59]** It's if I'm healed, I was healed, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:03]** You are deafened, prone, and you're not unconscious.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Let me pull that off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:06]** How do you cure the deafened condition?

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** Good question.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** Starfinder.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:15]** Starfinder.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:17]** Starfinder.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:18]** Yeah.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:21]** You were deaf for a certain minute.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:24]** You probably need to have a heal for it.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:29]** There's probably a specific condition to heal it or a specific method to do that.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** Yeah.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:33]** So you didn't hear Dr. Okay shout that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:40]** No, but you said that, Colin, you kicked the thing over to me on your way out?

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** I don't know.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** What did he do?

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:49]** I don't think he would think on his own to grab that computer

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:51]** Yeah, Colin grabbed it anyway.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Oh, you took it?

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** No, he didn't take it.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:58]** Didn't you grab it, Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:04]** I picked it up upside down, couldn't figure it out, tossed it in Rick's general direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:30]** right okay so yeah it would have slid towards rick and he would like he i think he would piece together that and so he's gonna grab the the um thing while he's still on the ground he doesn't even bother standing up uh and he's gonna just key into it and i'm gonna roll computers 18 plus 6 for 24 on computers so sorry so you saw him pick it up and now you're like i'm gonna go pick it up or now i'm gonna go use it no he like tosses it towards rick


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:53]** okay got it so it gets slides to rick as he's as everything's going on right but you didn't hear from dr okay that you need to open it you just you just saw him and so then you're like i guess i'm saying that the act of colin tossing it to him would give him enough information to surmise that he should try to access the data pad


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:58]** Yeah, because we all watch Notans use the data pad to control it.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** Sounds good.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:00]** So you got a 24.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:06]** It doesn't work.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** 24 is not enough?

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** 24 is not enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:15]** Rick shouts, 24 is not enough.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:20]** Uh, so that is my whole turn, I think.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:24]** Because I did a move action to pick it up, and then a move action to the computer's check.

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:35]** And I could speak, though, so I would say to the comms, like, I can't get into this computer by myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:38]** Okay.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** Here's Fabricius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:40]** Wait, sorry.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** One last thing.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:48]** Is there anything on the computer or on the pad that's like signifying anything important about this situation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** It has the stewards logo.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:55]** It's very light, but you get the sense that it's been hardened and modified to be very tough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:57]** That's the pad itself.

**[00:48:57 - 00:49:00]** But is there anything on the screen that says like stats?

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** It's a stewards logo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:05]** It has her stats, her like Starfinder stats on the thing.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:33]** it has it has note in starfinder stats it's got no it's a dragonoid i'm joking it's just a it's it's just a steward's logo you're saying it's a screensaver yep it's like bouncing throughout the corners yeah she has it on okay slideshow and it's yeah it's like it's just it's like pictures of a dragon dinosaur dragon yeah holding a dragon egg selfies just like scratching it under the chin


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:35]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:38]** I'm just picturing the dragon egg and all these things.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:40]** Yeah, right.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** Yeah.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:44]** She's like, oh, no.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** Her head's on fire.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:45]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:53]** Don't you dare humanize her, that bitch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:57]** She had some good memories that only she and the experimental dragon know about.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:00]** Here's, Farisius, what are you doing?

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** You've just been clawed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:05]** I'm guessing here's is in a threatened square, is that correct?

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** Here's is in a threatened square.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:11]** Is the reach of this dragon longer than five feet with its claws?

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:13]** Yes, yes, it is 10 feet.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:15]** Okay, so I couldn't do a guarded step

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:43]** basically to get away you could you could yeah yeah you could do it but you would not necessarily get away what what's the but it decreases the chance that i'll be successfully hit on an attack or something like that what do you know get away yeah like you could take a guard step but you would still be in its range so you would have to take two guarded steps to get out of its range pointless then but i can't even do i guess i could do two guarded steps in one move right no

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** You could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** That'd be your whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:51]** You could in theory, but you couldn't do anything after that.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:53]** And to shut the door is a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:55]** Quite bad.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** You did kill Nodens.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** It's mom.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:00]** A lot of good Sundays with her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** You could take a garbage step and then shut the door.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:04]** Could you not shut the door and then just walk?

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** Could also do that.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** I don't see why not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:07 - 00:51:08]** Oh yeah, I could do that.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:17]** I had something else in my mind that was way cooler, but because of the reach of this dragon, I haven't been thinking about that too much.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:22]** So here's this going to, because it's a free action perhaps to shut the door.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** Why do I not know anything?

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** Shutting door.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:25]** It's a move action.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** It's a move action.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:27]** Move action.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Interact with the object.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:32]** I'm asking AI and it says, yes, you're right.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:32]** It's crazy.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** All right.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:36]** So I'm going to like, I'm going to close the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:37 - 00:52:00]** that's a move action but i can double move right it's like a solid like thing no because you're using half your action close the door so you cannot fully retreating now this is crazy this is what it is i understand kevin but i can move now as well so i mean like i have to move back yes door shut yes yes you can downgrade your standard to a move action correct


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:05]** Actually, he's going to do this instead.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** Not that a move action is a downgrade.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:11]** Actually, he's not going to do that instead.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:12]** Let's see.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:16]** So I had something cool and now I have to change my coolness.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:17]** All right, so.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Change the coolness.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** Yeah.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:19]** All right.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** He's going to go.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:27]** He's going to lure the dragon away because he's really, really like a good pal and tactician.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:31]** And he's going to lure the dragon away from the rest of his teammates.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** Yeah, that's right.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:33]** He's going to bring them into this hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:35]** You lure the dragon away by closing the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:37]** I close the door.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:38]** You literally lock this in the room.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:40]** You close the door and then you run away.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:44]** And then I'm going further into the hallway because I know he's going to follow me.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** And that was my intent.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** Is he going to follow you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** When I attacked him.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** But as a dragon, can dragons open doors is the question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:50]** Right.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** Do dragons have reversible thumbs?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:54]** We're banking on the fact that dragons can open doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:57]** Is this a polydactyl dragon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** It's a fairly smart dragon.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:09]** This is why James killed Nodens, because he wanted to lure this dragon towards him and away from his teammates.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** I got a 6 out of 100.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:13]** But 40 chests is pretty common in Starfinder, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:22]** Okay, so, oh, I didn't roll for effect as a blur because she's shot at the dragon, but it's fine.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:24]** We'll just say it's 80%, so it's fine.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:29]** So you shut the door and you move back in the hallway closer to the room with the listener.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:33]** Yeah, he's going to lure the dragon into this hallway.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:35]** It's my headcanon about it.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** That's your headcanon.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** I'm retconning my intent.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** All right, let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** Okay, got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:41]** Got it.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:41]** Okay, sounds good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** All right, here's good turn.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:49]** Effecta is going to... What will she do?

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** said, wait, you didn't get Bernice.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:56]** She's right.

**[00:53:56 - 00:54:16]** or he is right and she is going to move back in that way let me roll a athletics i believe to get down she swiftly jumps down that's so awesome thank you that's a five foot move and then how far can she move she has 30 fate

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** No, 40 feet.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:27]** That is 25 across, right underneath Bernice, but 10 feet down.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:34]** The question is, can she do two... She hasn't moved her full speed, but she's done an athletics check to jump down.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:41]** Can she do another climb to get up in the same... I mean, it's within her movement, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** Climbing down is part of her first move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** Right.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** Well, yeah, it was like climb down.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** So I think you can do two climbs.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:50]** I don't see why you couldn't.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:51]** So now she just has to climb up.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** We can ask.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** We can ask the folks.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:58]** I think for now it makes sense that she would be able to.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** She got a 16 on the dive.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** So she is able to get up.

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:07]** And I assume that she's okay standing in Bernice's square because Bernice didn't take her the whole square.

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** Yeah?

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:08]** Yeah.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** I mean, we can move her over a little bit.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** Just in case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:15]** Okay, so she now has Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** She is standing next to Bernice.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** She can't pick up Bernice.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:20]** Why not?

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:23]** Because she used her entire move to go up.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:26]** Yeah.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:31]** Dr. O'K, I'll say without, because you're keyed into Bernice, without...

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:36]** a perception check, you notice that she sees Bernice and she's like, great.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:45]** And she also looks into the lab and she seems really focused on, like, now that the dragon is, you know, like, not in front of it.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** She's like, what's going on in this lab?

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** That is Effecta's turn.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** She's like, Doctor, okay.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:52]** I got Bernice.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:53]** No worries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** Thanks, Effecta.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** End of round nine.

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:58]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** Rick.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** Kev.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Your hand is raised.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:05]** So climb is as part of a move action.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:07]** You can use an athletics check.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:07]** Yep.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:11]** And then an athletics check gives you half movement.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:15]** A successful check gives you half your land speed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Oh, okay.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** So then she probably couldn't do two.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:21]** She probably couldn't move half, then move 25 feet, right?

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** That's probably too much.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:26]** Well, it would be half her movement for the climb.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:27]** For the climb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** So it's 20 down.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:31]** So then she climbed down here, so then she could move...

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:36]** She has 40 total, so then she can move 20 to get to where she is.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:38]** So she's almost, she ran over Astara.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** She's back down.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** She's running.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:43]** You can still see, though, that I think it still stands, Dr. K, that you're tracking her.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:46]** And you're like, she seems interested in Bernice.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:48]** She also seems interested in what's in the lab.

**[00:56:49 - 00:57:00]** Dr. K, you also notice pretty clearly that the wall next to you is starting to shake.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** And you're feeling the ground shake a little bit too.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:09]** It is the top of round 10.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** Round 10, folks.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** This is wild.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:13]** This is wild.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** Let me see right here.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:20]** Let me see what this is.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:22]** Someone's coming.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:23]** Maybe.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:24]** It's Rudy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:29]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:30]** The lava striders?

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:33]** It's the dragon's turn.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:35]** The door is shut on the dragon.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:37]** The dragonoid.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:39]** It's not a real dragon.

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** The experimental dragonoid.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** The door is shut.

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:41]** Rude.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:44]** The dragon turns around.

**[00:57:46 - 00:57:47]** Who will the dragon attack?

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:48]** Wait.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** This is the question.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** Who will the dragon attack?

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:52]** No.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:56]** Rick, Colin, Effecta, or Doctor, okay.

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:56]** I don't know.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** The door is open.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:06]** The heat from the Varus landscape is now starting to really affect all of you, except for here, who's nice and cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:11]** But the rest of you are like, Kelly, a question.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** Well, no, I guess I'll wait until my turn, actually.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:13]** I'm going to wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** You're going to wait until?

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:17]** Okay.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** Sounds good.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:19]** Sounds good.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:24]** All right, we'll say Dr. Okay 1, Effector 2, Rick 3, Colin 4.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:33]** I feel like it could be Colin because he just is standing near this huge flashing thing that's like... And the dragon's like, well, I don't know what that is, but that doesn't seem good.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:37]** Boots and cats and boots and cats.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:39]** All right, so... Boots and cats and boots and cats and boots.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** Let's see.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** Let's see how far that is.

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:46]** The dragon flies.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:52]** It just runs and lifts off and flies and lands in between.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:53]** Does it have wings?

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:54]** Yes, it does.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:58]** It lands in between 30 feet away.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** In between.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:01]** I want to move it there.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:01]** There it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:22]** within range of rick and colin how what oh it lands yeah lands within rick yeah on a scale from one to p diddy how am i it's a great question man it's a really good question get the baby oil out of here uh do i get an attack of opportunity


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** You can't guard a step of landing.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:26]** You could get an attack of opportunity, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:27]** All right.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:28]** You get one when you land.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** Said you could try.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** Because you move into the square.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** So I would think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:34]** Go ahead.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** I have a 10-foot reach, too.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** Go ahead.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** As you're landing.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:37]** That's fine.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:38]** Oh.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:41]** With your average pole, that's right.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:44]** I'm still laying down, so I don't gain anything from that.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:47]** But I do have my apprehension class.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:52]** You get a minus two to your attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:52]** My AC.

**[00:59:53 - 00:59:54]** No, it's AC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:54]** No, it's AC.

**[00:59:56 - 00:59:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:03]** If you hit, you get a plus to your attacks for ranged attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:08]** That's a 17 plus 8, whatever the math is on that.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:09]** 25.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:13]** That's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** That's a hit!

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:16]** And I gotta find my D10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:18]** What kind of damage is this?

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** kinetic slashing, right?

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** Yeah.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:21]** When you're lying on the ground, you're prone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:24]** When prone, you take a minus four penalty to melee attack rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** So 21.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** Wait, sorry.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:27]** You do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:29]** To melee attack rolls?

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** To melee attack rolls?

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** Yes.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:31]** Okay.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:31]** So it's a 21.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:32]** It's a 21.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** Still a hit.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:34]** Against KAC?

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:35]** Still a hit.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:35]** Yeah.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** Against KAC.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** Yeah, still a hit.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** It's a piercing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:39]** Piercing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:42]** You pierce into this weird skin.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** It's a six and a...

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:46]** Eight.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:46]** 14.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:51]** 14 plus eight more for 22.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:51]** Okay.

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:54]** 22 points of damage.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** That was an awesome attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:57]** That is insane.

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:02]** And because you are attacking... Because you are attacking...

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:09]** 22 yikes, okay Wow, that's a lot of damage son.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** Did I do the math on that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:12]** Yeah, what'd I say six plus six plus eight?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:32]** Okay, six plus five you plus eight probably because Insane you stab it by I'm a soldier in its foot and this like red green blood ichor Just like spurts out onto your face and onto your armor and onto the ground in front of you as you have dealt a significant amount

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:36]** bit of damage to this dragon's Achilles.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** Yeah.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:38]** Impressive.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:39]** It's now going to attack you.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:44]** It only has one Achilles because it's a tailed creature.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** Yeah, it's Achilles tail.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:51]** It's going to take its tail and swing at you.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:57]** That is a 33 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:58]** That's a hit.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** And Rick is about to go down again.

**[01:02:00 - 01:02:01]** I'm sure.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:03]** 13 points of damage.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** Oh, I'm still up.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:05]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:06]** You're still up.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** Okay.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:10]** How much HP do you have?

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** This is wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:14]** This is wild.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:14]** One?

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:15]** Do you have one?

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:15]** I have six.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** You have six?

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:17]** Nice.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:20]** Well, you took damage from her throat, right?

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:25]** You took damage last time from her throat, and that puts you at... 17.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:25]** 17.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:27]** Oh, yeah, because you got, like, 25.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:29]** Yeah.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:30]** All right.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:32]** But you said I got 13 points of damage?

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:33]** Just now, 13 points of damage.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:34]** Yeah.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:37]** Okay, so 17 minus 13... It's four.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:41]** It's actually minus 12, so it should be five points of damage.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:43]** Why is it?

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:43]** Wait, what?

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:51]** I don't know why I went to... Oh, it must have already automatically counted in my force field.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:51]** That's what happened.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:52]** Got it.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:53]** Okay.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:53]** Cool.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]** Dr. Okay, it's your turn.

**[01:02:56 - 01:03:04]** Rick is not in a great place, and he also is holding the Nodon's data pad, and this dragon is in the middle of taking out all of your colleagues, possibly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:11]** Yeah, so Dr. Okay is going to move towards the action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:34]** oh okay all right um let's see with that outside of the reach of the dragon right now you are not within 10 feet i don't believe plus the dragon is 10 feet down so i think you're okay yeah i think with with pythagoras on your side you're 10 feet down you're greater than 10 feet away yeah yeah if you moved one over you would be i think

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:35]** Cool.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:37]** If you moved one to the left, you would be closer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:37 - 01:03:38]** Yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:39]** So what do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:45]** Well, first I want to see what's going on in the room across.

**[01:03:45 - 01:03:52]** Can I perceive anything unusual about the dragon's origin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:55]** You see a...

**[01:03:55 - 01:04:21]** bunch of just like biomaterial everywhere you're thinking this is probably a combination of not good lab like hygiene and keeping and the release of this dragon happening like so quickly um you see a bunch of empty bottles and beakers these like cluttered tables of various liquids kind of like you know like spilt all around their readouts like

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:31]** on all these machines, and you think you see kind of a clear area in the back, but where you're at, you can't fully see it.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** You're just occluded a little bit.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:41]** So in the back right, it seems like there's something going on over there, but you can't see what it is because you're just that extra little bit of feet away, so you can't see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:45]** Okay.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:46]** Did you give me a perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:47 - 01:04:47]** Yeah, sure.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:50]** I got a natural 20.

**[01:04:50 - 01:04:51]** You got a natural 20.

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:52]** For what?

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:54]** 33.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:56]** For 33.

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** Okay.

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:59]** Good to know.

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:00]** What do you want to do with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:07]** I'm at the end of my movement and realizing that I'm feeling sluggish.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:09]** No pun intended.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:19]** I'm going to hit myself with a basic booster to increase my movement by 10 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** Holy cow.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:21]** A little self-care.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:24]** A little Trenton Owen there on the face.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** I like it.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:28]** That's your turn.

**[01:05:28 - 01:05:29]** Smart turn.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:32]** Dr. K doing some recon, seeing what you can see.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:32]** I like it.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:34]** Colin, it's your turn.

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:38]** You almost were about to get hit, and then Rick instead...

**[01:05:38 - 01:05:39]** Took that from you.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:40]** Stole your thunder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:42]** Stole all of the thunder.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** All of the thunder.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:45]** What do you want to do?

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:52]** In an effort to steal it back, Colin is going to load a... He's going to load his needler pistol.

**[01:05:53 - 01:06:00]** What you notice is instead of a normal stinger, it's got a green substance on the inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:07]** So... Face down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:08]** Let's roll to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:36]** with the are you shooting um i'm gonna so you're shooting incurring an ao uh yeah i was gonna say you're within actually i'm gonna take a five foot step to incur the ao there it is okay it's gonna swing at you that is a 32. uh that just barely hits yeah i i figured it meets beats right that's 11 points of damage

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:42]** 11 points of damage from the claw as it swipes you as you move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:43]** No, it's not.

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:44]** I'll take that.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:46]** And he no longer has an AO for this round.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:48]** Very true.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:49]** Excuse me.

**[01:06:49 - 01:06:50]** Cool.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:51]** And then he's going to pop the shot off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:53]** Pop the shot off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:54]** Pop it.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:56]** Let me know what you get.

**[01:06:56 - 01:07:01]** That's a 14 on the die plus 8 for 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:03]** 22.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:05]** That's a hit, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:06]** That is a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:10]** Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap.

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:11]** What kind of damage are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:11 - 01:07:13]** That is 1d4 plus 3.

**[01:07:14 - 01:07:18]** So that is 6, whatever the V is.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:20]** Bludgeoning.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:20]** Bludgeoning.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:21]** Right?

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:21]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:24]** With your needler?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:25]** With my needler pistol.

**[01:07:26 - 01:07:26]** Cool.

**[01:07:27 - 01:07:27]** Sorry, piercing.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:29]** Piercing.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:30]** I was reading the wrong line.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:40]** That is six piercing, and I have successfully administered something I've had in my inventory since we first met.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:42]** What did you do?

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:43]** Amblerie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:45 - 01:07:46]** Enchanté.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:46 - 01:07:48]** Which is a wisdom track.

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:50]** What?

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:51]** Poison?

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:51]** Poison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:52 - 01:07:55]** Dude, you're making me bust out the poison chart?

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:57]** Bust out the poison chart?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:07:57 - 01:08:01]** Progression track is weakened, impaired, blinded, no end state.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:03]** Yikes.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:07]** Okay, so it takes six points of damage immediately just from the hit, right?

**[01:08:07 - 01:08:08]** That's the hit.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:12]** Then it takes damage from the poison on its first round.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:17]** So as soon as it's administered, it takes damage from that poison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:17]** So what is that damage?

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:18]** I don't think it does.

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:21]** It just moves them down the track.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:25]** Right, but when poisons first hit, they also take damage.

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:26]** I'm quite sure about this.

**[01:08:26 - 01:08:27]** Okay.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:29]** Yeah.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:33]** When they first get in, it's a bit of damage there.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:35]** For full details on poisons, click here.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:41]** Yeah.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:47]** Upon initial exposure, regardless of whether she succeeds at her saving throw, the victim loses a number of hit points equal to the poison's DC minus 10.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** So what's the DC?

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:49]** 13.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:50]** 13.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:52]** So three extra points of damage.

**[01:08:52 - 01:08:52]** Nice.

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:53]** Yikes.

**[01:08:54 - 01:08:55]** Yeah.

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:55]** So you get that.

**[01:08:56 - 01:08:57]** And then I have to make a fortitude save.

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:58]** Yeah?

**[01:08:58 - 01:08:58]** Yeah.

**[01:08:59 - 01:09:00]** Okay.

**[01:09:00 - 01:09:01]** I'm going to roll with this die.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:05]** And I really, really, really hope that... I hope this works.

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:08]** I hope this works.

**[01:09:08 - 01:09:09]** Where's my fort at?

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:10]** I don't know where my fort is.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:12]** Let's see.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:14]** And it's DC 13, right?

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:15]** To pass that check.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:20]** And how many checks do I need to pass in order to completely be good?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:21]** It says cure one save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:24]** Cure is one save.

**[01:09:24 - 01:09:25]** Okay.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:26]** Amblery, cure is one save.

**[01:09:27 - 01:09:27]** I don't think it says that.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:28]** Okay.

**[01:09:28 - 01:09:33]** That is a... Huh.

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:34]** That is a 14.

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:36]** Yeah.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:40]** Well, still did damage.

**[01:09:40 - 01:09:41]** Still did damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:42]** Three extra points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:45]** So nine points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:46]** Yeah.

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:46]** Okay.

**[01:09:46 - 01:09:48]** Hey, just... Yeah.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:51]** So you moved first to avoid the attack of opportunity on your ranged attack.

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:52]** Oh, that was bad.

**[01:09:53 - 01:10:00]** But just so we are all on the same page, that wouldn't stop your ranged attack.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:01]** No.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:04]** It's only the spells that stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:08]** I get a bonus to my AC when I take an attack of opportunity from moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:10]** Okay.

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:11]** Nailed it.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:15]** I just wanted to make sure you weren't trying to skirt around.

**[01:10:16 - 01:10:17]** You guys are playing smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:18]** Picking up.

**[01:10:18 - 01:10:19]** This is good.

**[01:10:19 - 01:10:20]** Leveling up.

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:41]** in real life here okay colin i like it rick 19 it's your turn what are you doing colin has just dealt some damage trying to help you out since you're at six hit points or whatever yeah rick like used whatever energy he had to hit um this thing last time and he's he's just like not feeling well so he


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:50]** He's laying on his back, and he's going to dig through his pockets and pull out a serum of healing and inject himself with it.

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:52]** You can also f*** off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:52 - 01:10:59]** I was going to say, he did take that AoO reaction from the dragon for this round.

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:02]** So if you want to get up.

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:03]** Get out of here.

**[01:11:03 - 01:11:05]** If you want to run away, it's an option.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:06]** You're saying get up and... You could run.

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:06 - 01:11:07]** That's all I'm saying.

**[01:11:07 - 01:11:07]** You could run.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:09]** You could... That's all he's saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:09 - 01:11:11]** He doesn't want to run because he's in a good area to attack.

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:12]** Okay.

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:13]** So, like... Okay.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:14]** The low ground.

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:16]** He just wants to make sure he's still in the fight.

**[01:11:18 - 01:11:22]** So, I mean, I'm just going to use my turn to get my health back up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:22 - 01:11:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:26 - 01:11:26]** Four...

**[01:11:29 - 01:11:30]** Seven.

**[01:11:30 - 01:11:31]** That's 11 points.

**[01:11:33 - 01:11:37]** And three for 14 points.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:39]** Okay.

**[01:11:39 - 01:11:40]** So you heal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:42]** That is my whole turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:11:42 - 01:11:43]** That's your whole turn.

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:44]** You heal.

**[01:11:44 - 01:11:45]** I like it.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:46]** All right.

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:47]** Here's Fabricius.

**[01:11:47 - 01:11:49]** What are you doing in the nice air-conditioned hallway?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:52]** So all by yourself.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:53]** You're sad and lonely.

**[01:11:53 - 01:11:53]** Yeah.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:56]** There's like a little like something nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:56 - 01:11:58]** Yeah.

**[01:11:58 - 01:11:59]** Some nice music playing.

**[01:12:01 - 01:12:02]** So this comes over.

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:03]** Dragonite.

**[01:12:03 - 01:12:04]** Yeah.

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:09]** The hallway is too large to make it through this story.

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:11]** Just decided it wasn't worth it.

**[01:12:12 - 01:12:12]** You shut the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:15]** And this dragon is not experimental.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:17]** Dragon is great question for plot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:18 - 01:12:18]** Yeah, it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:19 - 01:12:21]** No, come on, come on.

**[01:12:21 - 01:12:23]** It's a mechanical question.

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:23]** I just want to know.

**[01:12:24 - 01:12:25]** Like, is he just too big or he can't?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:26]** This dragon's pretty smart.

**[01:12:27 - 01:12:28]** This dragon's pretty smart.

**[01:12:28 - 01:12:29]** No, it didn't think you were worth it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:29 - 01:12:31]** Most dragons are smart.

**[01:12:31 - 01:12:34]** Aw, now I'm feeling really bad.

**[01:12:34 - 01:12:35]** I didn't say that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:35]** I didn't say that.

**[01:12:35 - 01:12:37]** But what do you want to do with your turn here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:39]** He's got to spend his whole turn running back and reopening the door.

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:40]** That's his whole turn.

**[01:12:40 - 01:12:41]** Yeah, it kind of sucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:44]** I legit was going to lure him.

**[01:12:44 - 01:12:45]** I had an idea.

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:46]** I believe you.

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:50]** Here's Spence's turn getting back and opening the door.

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:50]** Okay.

**[01:12:50 - 01:12:52]** And now you can see the dragon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:54]** What do you see now totally different than when you left?

**[01:12:54 - 01:12:55]** Yeah.

**[01:12:55 - 01:12:56]** I gotta say.

**[01:12:56 - 01:12:56]** Whoa!

**[01:12:57 - 01:12:57]** It's pretty different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:58 - 01:13:01]** But he pretends like he was standing there the whole time.

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:01]** Hey, guys!

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:02]** Well, whatever.

**[01:13:02 - 01:13:03]** That was fun.

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:03]** That was crazy.

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:06]** Yeah, it was fun.

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:06]** That was weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:07]** That was weird.

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:08]** That was so weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:08 - 01:13:09]** I was waiting for you to come through the door.

**[01:13:09 - 01:13:10]** I was going to blast you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:11]** That was so weird.

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:18]** So here's Lore, you know, in all the characters' minds, maintains his bravery and his commitment to the team.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:19]** Roll a bluff check.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:21]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:22]** That's his turn.

**[01:13:22 - 01:13:23]** All right.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:24]** So that's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:25]** You're a copy of a strong with ears.


## Speaker_0

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:13:27 - 01:13:54]** uh okay this effect is turn she is effective at moving she moves five feet that's five feet she spends 20 of it to get up next to uh bernice and then i think that's more than her move action so she can't pick up bernice so she's gonna stay there for a second but she is looking inside dr okay you see her looking in to see what is going on in the lab um

**[01:13:54 - 01:13:54]** Yeah.

**[01:13:54 - 01:13:58]** Can I, in action, be like... You want to ask her?

**[01:13:59 - 01:13:59]** Yeah.

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:01]** What's going on in that lab?

**[01:14:02 - 01:14:04]** She turns around as soon as you said that.

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:06]** She looks and peers over and turns around.

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:07]** And then she shouts to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:07 - 01:14:09]** She's like, it's here!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:12 - 01:14:13]** What's here?

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:13]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:14 - 01:14:15]** The big ass dragon?

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:17]** And then she turns back around.

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:19]** Can you clarify that?

**[01:14:21 - 01:14:23]** Wait, what's here?

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:24]** Wait, please.

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:27]** Wait, so her move action was to climb up the stairs.

**[01:14:27 - 01:14:34]** And then she spent five extra feet to move towards the wall, 25 to climb up.

**[01:14:34 - 01:14:37]** So she didn't have enough of a full move action to reach down and grab Bernice.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:39]** But instead, she peered over to see what was going on in the lap.

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:41]** But that's her move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:44]** And then what's her other action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:46]** So climbing is half your speed, right?

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:51]** So her speed is 40 feet, right?

**[01:14:51 - 01:14:51]** Okay.

**[01:14:51 - 01:14:52]** I think I'm doing that right.

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:53]** I could be doing it wrong.

**[01:14:53 - 01:14:54]** Anyway.

**[01:14:54 - 01:14:55]** That's fine.

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:56]** So it's the end of round 10.

**[01:14:56 - 01:14:57]** End of round 10.

**[01:14:57 - 01:14:57]** Lots happening.

**[01:14:57 - 01:15:01]** You guys have put up this huge V. You have...

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:09]** you've lured the dragon over into the middle of you guys, and any one of you could go down really at any point between Colin and Rick.

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:10]** It could be one crit away, right?

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:12]** That's how close we are.

**[01:15:12 - 01:15:16]** We are one crit away from permadeath.

**[01:15:17 - 01:15:18]** Here's didn't do anything.

**[01:15:18 - 01:15:28]** The door just mysteriously closed, and Dr. K and Effect are trying to keep the sides going, see what's happening.

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:36]** Dr. K, that same vibration that you felt before, you feel it again.

**[01:15:36 - 01:15:40]** Only this time you're like 40 feet away from the wall.

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:56]** And then you hear this loud, like, as the wall that has the screen to the south cracks right up the center and the screen fizzes out as there's something trying to burst through the wall.

**[01:15:58 - 01:15:59]** And that's our game.

**[01:15:59 - 01:16:03]** We'll see what happens next in episode 154 next week.

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:04]** Find out what's coming to the wall.

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:07]** Find out if Colin and Rick live or die.

**[01:16:07 - 01:16:10]** Find out if Hears steps into the hangar.

**[01:16:10 - 01:16:13]** Is it a friend or a fool?

**[01:16:14 - 01:16:15]** I don't know.

**[01:16:15 - 01:16:16]** What did it affect the find?

**[01:16:17 - 01:16:20]** Lots of questions.

**[01:16:20 - 01:16:20]** Hey, that's Rudy.

**[01:16:20 - 01:16:21]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:16:21 - 01:16:24]** Oh, yeah.
