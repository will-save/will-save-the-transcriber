**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** I wasn't trying to raw dog an intro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:07]** I was going to wait until you get to the music.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** I want that music.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** We got the music that I wanted.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Sounds like Castlevania music.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:39]** Brought in by Huel.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:42]** Huel, the unofficial sponsor of We'll Save the Podcast since day one.

**[00:03:52 - 00:04:02]** I miss being young when it was like you were only ever a ramen noodle and a day full of daytime TV away from feeling back to 100%.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:02]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:06]** I miss the days when colds weren't genetically modified.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** Was this the 1800s?

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:14]** Was this the early 20th century?

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:55]** What, like, what song for you brings back, like, childhood memories?

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:02]** What's, like, the song that if you heard it, you're like, oh, dude, this is, you know, being in elementary school, this is being in high school.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:05]** The DuckTales theme.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:09]** Benny, you look like your tongue is out the side of your mouth.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:09]** It is.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:12]** You got that look like you had something that came to you immediately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]** Yeah, I did.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** I'm trying to think of the, like...

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:43]** the ones because it's a genre of music but there's also specific songs that's fine what's the what's the what's the genre salsa for sure salsa um that's cool if i hear kimbara by celia cruz i'm immediately back in like my parents apartment and like it's a saturday morning and we're cleaning everything and

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:58]** dishes are rattling and the house smells like fabuloso and like life is good yeah because i know as soon as i'm done with that i get to go outside and ride my bike and and it's it's just a good day yeah that like

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:11]** the first, like it, cause it opens with like bongos and then it's Celia just like, and it's just like that, that energy feels like my childhood.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:16]** Did your parents wake you up with that music and you just knew, oh crap, I gotta clean?

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:46]** no so like my my parents um were uh among other things um semi-competitive dancers in new york and so like when it was time to clean it was just as much a dance as it was work so like you would grab a thing and you would move but like you're spinning and you're twirling and you know my parents would be dancing in the living room and also like dusting things it's super like stereotypical tv but um

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:49]** because it was always like super loud salsa music.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** And that is like one of the most popular salsa songs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:54]** Um, it played a lot.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:58]** And of course I've heard it over and over and like, I don't know.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:58]** It just feels like home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** I think you need to share it in the discord.

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:01]** Yeah.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:02]** Yeah.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:02]** I will.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** Yeah.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** You absolutely have to.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** Yeah.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:08]** In the music channel, in the, in the music channel.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:08]** Yeah.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:08]** Yeah.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** So that way we can all clean to that music.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:15]** I think, I feel like a lot of people in the discord would vibe really hard to that and would love that.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:39]** discuss the album it's also fun yeah yeah i mean if if you want to join the album of the week club benny just for one album you just drop that album i could i tried doing that with weird al's bad hair day and nobody would let me do it yeah weird al's kind of niche hey there's been some pretty niche stuff on there it's all good you could do it you could do it yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:41 - 00:08:05]** anyone else I think my mind would be um like 90s country music like Garth Brooks uh and Clint Clint Black and some of those um those songs are like that's what my parents listen to so like you're saying yeah Alan Jackson's there and all those guys yeah Reba McIntyre


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:06]** Reba.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** Yeah.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:08]** Reba.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** Oh, what's the one?

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** She's a sitcom, right?

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:12]** Shania, yeah.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** Before she fell off.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:40]** has anyone seen shania's concerts recently no it's not it's a whole mess it like there are youtube videos of her just like sloppily singing half of her songs because she can't remember the the other half of the lyrics yeah yeah it's common amongst older artists yeah i feel like a woman i sing that one out loud every time yeah and people are like okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:43]** I feel like there are a lot of older bands that are killing it.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:47]** I've seen a lot of them come through, but sometimes I feel like you don't.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:51]** Somebody just announced a new tour, like ACDC or something.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** There might be an ACDC tour.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** Queen has been touring for a long time and killing it.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** Journey's been touring.

**[00:08:57 - 00:08:58]** Kansas.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:00]** I heard Elvis Presley's going live again.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** Going live on Switch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** There's a hologram.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:08]** Yeah, he's got that revival tour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:10]** Yeah, just going to put that 2000s tech.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:12]** I'm really glad that that did not revivify.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:16]** Tupac was the last hologram performance, right?

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:17]** Yeah.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:19]** I'm really glad that died off fast.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** Oh my goodness.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:30]** Not to use that, died off as bad when you were referring to Tupac, but I'm just saying when that happened, was it Coachella or something?

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:32]** I was like, man, this is, this is the future.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:34]** This is the current, like the future is now.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:36]** And then nobody else used it.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** So, right.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** Thank goodness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:46]** I mean, it really, it gained a lot of popularity when Michael Jackson died and like people were like, no, you know, the world can't go on with that MJ.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** And like, sure.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:50]** He was a pop icon for 40 years.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:55]** Um, but also like a hologram, isn't going to do a live show justice.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:56]** No, it's not at all.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:59]** No, not in the slightest.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** Not yet.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** Thanks, sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:03]** Kelly?

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:10]** You'd have to be more specific, but... Like what era?

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:10]** Yeah.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:15]** Das well-tempered der Klavier.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:20]** Well-tempered Klavier from Johann Sebastian Bach.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:22]** When we listen to that...

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:48]** Live live, you know Yeah, 16th century whatever shadow drop the new hey y'all I got a new singer coming out for shop from from the WTC or That's pretty bit pretty on point That was a bit fair That was a banger crowd lost their minds it's the BWV 849


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:57]** I do wish I could be in the crowd for classical music like that.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** Just go back and be at a concert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:00]** Back when it wasn't classical?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:01]** Right, yeah.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** Back when it was just the current.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Do you think they got offended?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:05]** They were like, wait, they're calling mine classical now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:10]** But they also called previous things classical, like Baroque and early music and stuff too.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** So they, you know, it's like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:36]** An interesting book, one of my favorite reads, actually, about music theory and its impact on society and culture is actually a book called An Evening in the Palace of Reason, where it's Bach and he's visiting, I think, Frederick the Great towards the end of the sort of


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:38 - 00:12:08]** Baroque era I think it is and it's like the start of the Enlightenment it's pretty interesting read I would love that I've heard that book it's been on my list I'm gonna gonna read it that sounds exactly up my alley I mean you were also probably there so you yeah you know it was nice to relive it for the author you know yeah yeah he goes for it yeah that's funny Kelly anything true


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** It's just a Saturday morning cartoon stuff.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:14]** I think DuckTales, the DuckTales theme is my all-time favorite one.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:18]** Probably followed by the Chippendales one, probably followed by... Gargoyles?

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** Chippendale Ranch Trail Spin?

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** Not the fucking...

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:26]** Yeah, Tailspin, the theme is not that good, but it's still memorable, you know what I mean?

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** Tailspin is the weakest of the themes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** I'm disappointed that there's no love for the X-Men theme.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:36]** The X-Men theme is amazing, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** Yeah, that's all we can use.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** It's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:50]** Okay, actually, for some reason, and it's weird because the American version of the Pokemon song is way better than the Japanese version.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:58]** However, somehow, the Japanese version of the X-Men theme is even better than the American one, which is already amazing.

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** I don't know how they pulled it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** I'm going to save this for later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:02]** Yeah, it's really crazy.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:06]** If I remember correctly, I was like, how could it be better?

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** X-Men.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** I couldn't believe it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:14]** The question is, did the studio have new musicians record it and they sent over the music?

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** They probably did.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:23]** Or did they just send over the masters and have just the singer?

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:26]** Oh, it's a different song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:27]** Yeah, it's entirely different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:32]** Also, I feel like the intro is different, like some of the animation.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** It might be.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:35]** Oh, wow.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** I don't see as many Sentinels.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** We're all saving that.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Yeah, right?

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:47]** The American Pokemon, the Japanese Pokemon theme is also completely different than the American one.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** The American one slaps.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:50]** It's the best one, in my opinion, by far.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** That's like the office.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** Take that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:54]** Yeah, the Sentinels are different.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:54]** America.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** The office, yeah.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:58]** It's like they're fighting Godzillas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** That's wild.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** Is there even?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:09]** Oh, in the Japanese theme song opening, they're like fighting not Sentinels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:10]** Oh, wow.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** They're fighting Godzillas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:18]** Or maybe they've reimagined Sentinels in Japan because they're like, well, we build robots.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:23]** And so we don't want to associate scariness with robots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:26]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** I feel like someone out there knows this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:32]** Someone at Honda or Toyota was like, no, no, no, you can't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:35]** Y'all, hey, let's come out on this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** Unless it's Mechagodzilla, then it's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:39 - 00:15:08]** uh i was trying to think i like that stuff i what about you i appreciate that it's a good story mine mine was very quintessential of the time like any album that is like a like a pop album from that time that is specifically especially if it's a guitar album so like room for squares john mayer like five for fighting or hey there delilah because it was at that time that i was learning these songs and playing them and then learning a lot of like early 2000s and 90s tunes to play with my buddies andrew and felix so it's like

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:12]** It's like anything that I've done, I've played it.

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** And I've played it live.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** And I've sang it.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** And it just takes you back immediately to that moment.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:20]** So any of that Top 40 stuff at that time was like gold to me.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:25]** And we even tried some of the more like Dashboard Confessional or My Chemical Romance stuff.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:30]** It didn't really pan out with two acoustic guitars and a violin and our voices.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:33]** But we tried.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:44]** But any of that stuff, especially Room for Squares, because I remember listening to it for the first time in a car full of people going to Myrtle Beach with our friend Jeff.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** What was the first CD you got?

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** Learning guitar.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** The first CD I bought?

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** That's a great question, too.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:51]** And we're at the end of our banter time here.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:53]** Wow.

**[00:15:53 - 00:16:15]** first cd i bought i think we might we might have to table that and make that our next banter yeah because that's a really good one that is a really good one i think we all start time when the cds at best buy had that like long plastic thing on it right you know and like it was like three times as long as the cd case unnecessarily so yeah yep

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:16]** All right, cool.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:19]** I'm going to save that for next time right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:21]** What was the first CD you bought?

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** That's great.

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:32]** I still can't hear Sister Hazel or anything by Pat Metheny without going right back to those days.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:33]** Totally.

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:33]** 100%.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:41]** Not to be a stickler, John, but was that technically from your childhood or was that your coming of age?

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** Because those are different things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:42 - 00:17:00]** so yeah so you know it's cool all right he spent his childhood in a monastery i started playing guitar when i became a man at 13.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:18]** So, uh, so that's when I like so so for me, that's what my musical journey really I I would like the moment, you know, so it's dropped Yeah, the moment that before that you were like guitar appeared in my hands One of the voice monks in skyrim just chilling out at the top of like the voice months.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** Yeah, I forget.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:22]** Yeah well

## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Yeah, and you would just know.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** You would pretend like you sent it to one of us, and then you have to read it.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** And then you're like, just kidding.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** That was mine.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** Okay.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** All right.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** Cool.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:39]** I'm down.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:44]** Well, speaking of, we do have a subscriber sentence.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:48]** So I want to read it.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** I'm going to roll.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:51]** Well, now I have to roll my D5.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:54]** It's not going to be me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:56]** Why is it not going to be you kind of one?

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:59]** I don't want it to be because it's hard every time.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** It's like very weird.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** I always get the weird ones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** I always get the weird ones.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:04]** All right, cool.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:08]** I have the order that I'm going to roll this in.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:13]** And I've dropped my die on the floor and we're going to use it.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:14]** Play it as it lands.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Play it as it lands.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** All right.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** Left to right.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:19]** That's what we're doing.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:20]** Sounds good.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:23]** I am grabbing that...

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:41]** language right now and then we will play and i need to open my discord because it was not open to wait for it to do all these updates these crazy updates it says cool it's done i'm gonna message that person five four three two one message that person on discord

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** Let's talk about last time.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:47]** It's been four episodes of combat.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:53]** I wanted to ask you guys, I mean, like, this was a crazy combat.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** Perhaps...

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:05]** Well, first I want to shout out some of the major points here right at the end of the Electrovor killing the android.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** It was Clutch to bring out the Electrovor.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:10]** Saving Hears from the nausea, Dr. Okay.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:15]** Clutch to dig in and be like, oh, that is actually how we're going to get out of this together.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:21]** And then Dr. Okay coming in again, killing the Gripley, killing the Wessel, and killing Brick.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** And then not taking any damage during the whole process.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** Like...

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:35]** Like, and Colin and Rick, uh, standing up, standing and banging here's feeling sick, throwing up, but then starting to unleash some damage and like make some game changing tactics here.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:43]** I mean, do we think the fights in threefold have been like, or in book three, is this the most difficult you think?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** I don't think so.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** No?

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:46]** Personally.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:51]** Well, maybe it's just because of the never-ending-ness that was book two.

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:54]** Every fight, to me, felt like a war.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** In book three or in all three?

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** Book two.

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** Oh, okay.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:01]** Book two was... I don't even like thinking about it to this day.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:05]** Maybe because I was throwing up the entire time and not getting hit.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Maybe that's why I'm saying this.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:08]** I'd be curious what other people think.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:10]** Because it didn't feel that bad to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:13]** I thought it was f***ing hard, but that's because I almost died.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** And that tracks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:35]** Yeah, I mean, the two of you ended literally, like, I don't want to, like, flavor it too much, but it felt like you're, like, backed into the corner in this cell, and this creature, the shadow of this, like, wet cell bioengineered creature is, like, coming into the room to attack you after having dealt a bunch of damage to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:38]** With, like, at single-digit health points.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:41]** Like, this was... Oh, yeah, that is scary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:53]** it was kind of alarming when when like everybody was in the hallway we were stacked just two by two and with nowhere to run it was a little harrowing but yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:22]** yeah yeah i mean 3fc is not it's funny book two is very fight heavy but as an ap so far i i still feel like it's not that it's not that fight heavy like outside of book two it's hasn't been yeah so yeah yeah it feels like the encounters are just really targeted and somewhat flavored differently especially in book one and three like there's so much context there that's less of a dungeon crawl stand and bang like book two was it's like it's more about


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:49]** maybe sometimes you're pushed there you know oh yeah book one had the the hug bot oh yeah that took out years that that was our first unconscious i know yeah that was embarrassing that was embarrassing no yeah it was good and daddy's his first combat too getting knocked out this is why i try to keep a distance guys so just saying that's why i try to keep it distant today it doesn't come from nowhere so got you got you yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:51 - 00:25:02]** Well, let's go back to the station and bring you guys over to the map here of Terrapin Station, the place that you have traveled nearly 500 miles to get to.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:04]** Quite a place.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** You can see on the map here.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:28]** that in the moments after brick falls down you all look and the hallway is now filled with instead of the body of a grippily a human male and a female android there is there are three

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:43]** Reptoid, green-scaled, mohawk crest, fins around the eyes, long, sharp claws, dead, laying in steward's uniforms.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:50]** And Colin and Rick, standing in front of you, is this, the dead figure of this wet selt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:56]** I just, I wanna, I wanna go back a little bit.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** Please.

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:16]** we had there were so many times that john made comments making us trying to gaslight us into thinking that these were not reptoids he's like oh maybe they're not reptoids yeah you're sure yeah the reptoids uh speaking of here's takes out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** Okay, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:20]** I was going to say, Rick looks down and says, f***ing reptoids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:25]** The heat must be overwhelming you all, too.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:35]** I mean, keep in mind this is much moister and humider, more humid than the outside with the hot water that they've had running.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:37]** It feels like home in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:47]** Yeah, you're probably okay, Dr. K, but the other three of you have just sweat pouring over your entire... Yours doesn't have pores, so speak for yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:47]** Wow.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:55]** Here's takes out his, like, data pad, and he, like, points it at one of the dead Reptoids, and it goes like, Reptoid!

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:57]** Like, you know what I mean?

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** And he, like, records that.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:02]** He's never seen one before, and adds it to the database.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** and does not.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:04]** Yeah.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:06]** I imagine Dr. Okay.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:09]** Also might take a DNA sample.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** Yeah.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** Okay.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:16]** I like it from which one was the Gripley's here at the bottom.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:18]** The one that was brick is in the middle.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** And the one that was the Android is at the top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:24]** Uh, I think the one closest to Dr. Okay.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:31]** The one of them, I don't want to say middle, but the last one, I don't remember the name of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** Was there one of the hybrid ones here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:37]** Nope.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** There's no hybrid.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:40]** I don't think you've seen a hybrid.

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:41]** The Wetzel.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:43]** Oh, there's a Wetzel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** The one that's in the room with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** Yeah, it's not a hybrid reptoid.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:51]** It's a bioengineered new creature entirely.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:56]** You said it was... It used to be a reptoid at some point.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:59]** It used to be a reptoid, but it's been devolved, let's say.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:03]** Bro, what if they were trying to do this to us?

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:10]** I mean, they are certainly masters of some bioengineering.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:22]** You all look through three of the three that are there laying in the hallway, the bodies of these reptoids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:26]** Colin hasn't seen the bodies, I don't think.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:31]** So he's stepping past the wet salt, gives it another kick for good measure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:34]** I'm taking a sample here, Colin.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:34]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** Sorry.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:40]** Steps into the hallway to see his three foes who are no longer who he saw.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** They're now Reptoids.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:47]** And I guess he turns to the group and says, oh, another fold to the conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:55]** I mean, if that was the phrase again, then that would be amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** Was that the phrase again?

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Cryo Damon did submit that again.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:01]** So yes, that was it.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:03]** Cryo, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** What is going on?

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** Oh, thanks.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:05]** I love it.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** It's another fold.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** Another fold?

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** It's folded again?

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:10]** It's just huge.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:10]** It's huge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:13]** You could only fold something like seven times, right?

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:18]** It becomes near impossible to fold it more than that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:20]** It's only true for an eight and a half by 11 sheet of paper.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:24]** Yeah, and not for a whole AP full of paper.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:26]** At least 50 to 60 pages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:29]** You could fold a conspiracy as many times as you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** A conspiracy piece of paper.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:31]** A conspiracy paper.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:34]** I see.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:51]** hears maybe you hear behind you the sound of a gun falling to the ground and you look back and you see that the android is breathing and leaning against the wall

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:55]** And just kind of slides down to sit for a second.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** Colin rushes over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:58]** Yeah, here's... Oh, okay.

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:03]** Well, here's doesn't want to get in on Colin's... He knows Colin's reading.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:04]** I'm fine.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:05]** I'm all right.

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** I just... Are you hurt?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** No.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:09]** No, I'm not.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** I'm not hurt.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:13]** Looks her over to establish a medical opinion.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:16]** Do you want to give me a message?

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:17]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** If I have to, gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:24]** Gosh, I'm fine.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:30]** I mean, as you're looking over, you can tell immediately just from the state of her clothes.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:34]** She hasn't put on that armor that you gave yet, Dr. K. Which armor did you give?

**[00:30:35 - 00:30:56]** i gave her some second skin like second skin my starter armor that i had thank you um yep yep what's your what's what's what's your role 30 30. uh you can tell that she is suffering from i mean she's suffering from mostly like mental

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:00]** and willpower damage.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:07]** She is pretty damaged from, well, you haven't asked her yet, but her psyche is like fractured.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:15]** Like she is staying very calm and succeeding at, you know, will saves, but

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** She is.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** We'll save.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:22]** We'll save.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:23]** Yeah.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:26]** She seems like that was a lot of energy for her.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** Physically, yes.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:29]** She's malnourished.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:39]** And the ability to go from zero to 60 and jump into a firefight and shoot and be active and just needs a little bit more time to rest maybe than you all did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:42]** All right.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:42]** All right.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Word.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:44]** Rest up.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:46]** You're safe for now.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** We've got you.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:49]** Thanks.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:56]** If I could make a suggestion, you might be a little safer if you put the armor on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:03]** Yeah, no, I'll do it in just a second.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:05]** Just hang on just one second.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:05]** Sure.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:08]** I'm Effecta.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:12]** By the way, kind of holds up one of her hands to shake your hand.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:13]** He shakes her hand gently.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:17]** I'm Colin.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:19]** I'm Dr. Eden Brand.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:20]** That there is here's.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:26]** The gentleman taking a sliver off that monstrosity in there is Dr. O.K.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:32]** Between you and me, he might be a better doctor than I am, but don't tell him that.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** There's a weak smile on her face.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:38]** And that gentleman over there with the gun pointed at you is like, put that down.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:43]** Are you certain that she's not a reptile?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:45]** I'm certain that she's not a threat right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:48]** I didn't ask that.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:50]** I asked if she was a reptile.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:57]** You all, I think you're probably not because you have just killed these three reptiles.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** F*** them, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** We could have killed them because we thought they weren't reptiles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:05]** you're not making a great case for yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:09]** If you're trying to say that you're not a reptile.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:11]** Dr. Could you check if she's a reptile?

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** I feel like you would know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** Okay.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:27]** I was, I was going to ask our new friend here if, uh, she wouldn't mind providing a blood sample that I could just make sure that there's no lasting, uh, effects from these creatures here.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:33]** Uh, perhaps they've been very interested in our genetics, uh,

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:38]** throughout the course of this debacle we find ourselves in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:40]** Yeah.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:45]** You're telling me, uh, that's I've, I've given a lot over the past week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:46]** So happy to give some more.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** And she just holds out her arm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:52]** Oh, they were experimenting on you.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** Were they?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:58]** I, that's one way to put it.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:58]** Uh,

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** Where do I start?

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:05]** Do we have time to sit for a sec?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** I'm going to sit.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:09]** And she like actually fully sits like crisscross applesauce.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Are we taking 10 minute rest?

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:14]** Cause I'll, I'll, I'll take one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** I mean, that's what she's doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:16]** All right.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** 10 minute rest.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:17]** Great.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** I'll sit down here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:23]** I say we should be on high alert though.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:25]** I won't be resting.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:26]** Okay.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:28]** We're probably being watched.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:30]** You look up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:33]** I'm not resting, but I'm just here to chill with you.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:34]** Hear you out.

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** You don't see any cameras inside here so far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:41]** That was just a reprieve from... Totally.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:44]** I probably should have said that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:45]** Anyways, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** No, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:50]** Colin's taking a 10-minute rest with her.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:57]** So Colin and Rick are sitting crisscross applesauce with Effecta.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** Yes.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:04]** Colin, you would remember that you saw Effecta's name on a separate chest from Korra's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Yeah, it is.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:15]** I've been here a couple days.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:20]** I don't quite remember what day I came.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** I'm a steward.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** He's not lying.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** It was one of the names he gave us.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** I'm just saying.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** It's there in the notes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:28]** Okay.

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:31]** Effect, this is very important.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:38]** Do you remember anyone else that might have been captured here?

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:39]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:45]** You're the only... Sorry, I'm the only one that's been here since I've been here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:47]** Right.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:51]** Do you remember anything from before you were here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:52]** Yeah.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:56]** I'm a steward from Roselight.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:09]** I have, I came up to Tyr Callus, I would say probably a week ago now.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:14]** Dr. Aurelia Nodens is a...

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:18]** quite the giant in her field.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:32]** And so I came here to maybe learn a bit from her on a suggestion from my partner, my steward's partner that I work with.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:37]** You know, weird place.

**[00:36:39 - 00:37:01]** weird hours weird security that commanding inspector jocks heard is uh it's very straight he's a reptile uh sorry what was that jock's herd is a reptoid they they are all reptiles is are the stewards not aware that this space has been taken over

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:05]** I don't think that they are.

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:08]** I don't think that they are.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** Let me get back to that in a second.

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:41]** nodens as i was asking questions and learning very gregarious very happy to have me there and then after a while a little too happy to have me there asking me to contribute some of my bio samples as part of the studies that she was doing samples of showing off new things that she was working on or trying to figure out and

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:48]** One day I went to bed, and then the next day I woke up in this cell.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:58]** And since then, I haven't known exactly who I am or what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:04]** Am I still at Tyrcalis?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:04]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:05 - 00:38:08]** Well, no, not Tyrcalis.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:09]** This is Terrapin Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:11]** Terrapin.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** Okay.

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Am I still on Veros?

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** Yes.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** Yes.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:18]** Okay.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** Unfortunately.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:22]** Yeah, I agree.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:27]** So it must have been, what day is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:29]** Do we know?

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:31]** Tuesday?

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:36]** The seventh day of the lunar week or whatever we say in this universe.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** How do you say it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:38]** Yeah.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:45]** Okay, so I've been here probably, I was there for maybe three or four days and I've been here now for three or four days too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:49]** Yeah.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** Yeah, Colin.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:55]** Out of character, how long were we there?

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** Like 24 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** 48.

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** You had two nights, I think.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:03]** You had one night, went through.

**[00:39:03 - 00:39:05]** Second night, a bunch of shit happened.

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:06]** And you decided to leave.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** Yeah.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:07]** Yeah.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:07]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** Second night, you're like, peace out.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** I think.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:10]** Got it.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:13]** So she would have left there right before we got there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:22]** When I was there, well, when I was there at first, it was just me.

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:29]** And then at some point later, these mercenaries came, these pikes came through.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:40]** And then I want to say, well, I guess I don't really remember because I fell asleep, but I think they might have left.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** I didn't really talk to them that much.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** They kind of stayed on the ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:46]** For your awareness, the pikes are also reptoids.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:47]** All the pikes?

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** Majority of them.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** Not all.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** All the pikes.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:55]** The one that Colin was in love with, as we are certain, is not a reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** She gives a little smirk.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:58]** All right.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** Well, I hope for your sake that she was not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:04]** She's dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:08]** I'm sorry to hear that.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** We just thought to get that out and rip the bandit off real quick.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:13]** It's going to be awkward if we don't bring it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:15]** We think she's dead.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:20]** The craft she was on was overrun by reptoids and then made a beeline to here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:28]** I think there's still a plausible chance that she is alive and has escaped.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** It's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** I'm holding hope for you.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** Yeah, I am.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:36]** I shouldn't even have brought it up.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** We don't want to bring it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:42]** So it sounds like there's a chance that you two might still be able to be together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:43]** Aye.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** That's great.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:49]** She's only second on the list of people I'm looking for in this base, though.

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:53]** Who's the first?

**[00:40:53 - 00:40:58]** When we looked in that medbay over there on the other side of that wall behind you.

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** F*** that medbay.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:01]** Aye.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Let me tell you that.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:05]** Yeah.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:07]** Is there another bed bay we should be searching?

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** So refreshing.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:10]** No, no.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** There's only one.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:12]** Are you sure?

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** There's no other medical bay.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:15]** Okay.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:16]** That I know of.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:19]** I would just hate for us to miss a second med bay.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:21]** Definitely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:24]** Is there one called the quote other med bay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:26]** And your number one is there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** We'll find him.

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:29]** I'm sure.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:38]** Now, a few bits down from where we saw the chest with your name on it, there's another, Cora Edenbrand.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:41]** Cora Edenbrand.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:42]** Okay.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** I don't know that person.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** I'm sorry.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:46]** I've not seen her in a very great many years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:51]** I think it's just a coincidence that Colin's last name is also Edenbrand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** Oh, okay.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:57]** So it's just, is that a common name where your friend called?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:57 - 00:42:01]** It cannot be related to him because he killed his sister that was named Cora.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:02]** Got it.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:05]** Rick's the pretty one in the group, but that's kind of it.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** Rick, Dr.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** O.K., you had a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:16]** I was wondering if in your time here, if they had let their intentions for you be known to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:21]** That's a good, oh, hang on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:48]** oh sorry i just oh i just she kind of like like rubs her head and you can tell that the memory of like whatever they've done is like painful to her um you know it's it's it's real torture is is kind of the sense that you're getting and she says he with her eyes closed she's like you know the first time that dr nodens questioned me um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:55]** They said it was part of my advanced training as a steward.

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:58]** I see.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:01]** But then she started to make me doubt who I am.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:11]** They got something that they put over your head, sits on your temples and connects to one of them.

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** I mean, I'll be honest.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:24]** I haven't seen them look like this, uh, but, uh, I've heard their language and I, I, well, I'm a bit of a conspiracy nut.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:30]** Well, my partner is, so it's been, I recognized a bit of what was going on here, I think.

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:42]** And, uh, yeah, when they pull your memories from your head, it feels like somebody is pushing your finger against the, the tip of a needle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:46]** That's just to find it.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:52]** And then to pull it out, it's like they're pushing your finger against the eye of the needle and they pull your finger through the eye of the needle.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:59]** It hurts to come out as I'm retelling it, maybe even reliving it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:03]** I'm so sorry for all that's happened to you.

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:13]** Rest assured, I think we're ready to fight them and get off this godforsaken place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** Yeah.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** I'm going to lean on you all, but I, I can do my part.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:22]** And she starts to kind of weakly grab the second skin and unfold it.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:27]** Um, she, as she does, she says that they, they don't around.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:31]** So they were trying to remake me.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** One of them was going to be me.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:40]** Some, some one of that and just points to the one that was the gripply is, was, was going to be me.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:45]** So Colin, I don't know again, whether it,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:55]** who this person was to you, this Korra, but if they're out there, you got to question them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:56 - 00:45:08]** Colin, I'm not trying to be in, what's the word, mean, but if we find Korra, we need to confirm that she is not a reptoid.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:11]** That also gets me to think that they

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:37]** all of the the stewards that we have seen here that are now reptilian bodies like that they may still be alive somewhere we might be able to recover them ah another fold to the conspiracy yes oh my God speaking of uh where is your partner when was the last time that you spoke to them a week ago


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:37]** I don't know.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:39]** That's not unheard of.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** They're probably on Rose Night now.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:57]** Well, if we can get off here, that was my plan from the beginning, was if I could ever gain my senses back and, you know, stand a fighting chance against them, maybe I thought, well, I'll get on one of the ships here.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:00]** I also did think that I was maybe still at Tyrcalis.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:04]** So now I don't even know if there are ships here.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:08]** I guess we'll have to figure that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** We'll have to find out.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:10]** We know there should be at least one.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:12]** At least one.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:14]** But that's supposed to be our ticket to off.

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:17]** I'm sure we're more than happy to drop you somewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:21]** Speaking of, I suggest we get a move on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:23]** I agreed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:23 - 00:46:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** Has it been 10 minutes now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:31]** I do have some questions for you all, but maybe we can talk about it on the ship if we get out.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:35]** Also, you might want to meet Zitch.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** We're in an interesting situation.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** Zitch is my partner.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** Zitch?

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** Yeah.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** X-Y-C-H.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** They're Sheeran.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** All right.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:53]** Look, is there anything that we can get from these pulls here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:56]** She kind of starts to put on the armor and look over.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** I think one of them dropped an apprehension pull.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:02]** Yeah, they dropped a couple things.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:06]** The apprehension class capture pull.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:14]** They dropped a Mark II ring of resistance pull.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:20]** There is a hook sword and a pusher decoupler.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:29]** And there are also two, um, let me see if I can put it in here.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:31]** Sick a tight tonics.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:59]** and an abyssinium filter i'll put it in the chat here and uh that way you all can i can add it later and i can tell you what each one of them does and a cicatite tonic quantity two um i of course did not open up my handy dandy pdf notebook of book three so

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:02]** Crazy that I didn't open this whole time.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:03]** Let me open that up.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:18]** I can tell you exactly what these things do so The sick a tight tonic really interesting for one hour You gain cold and fire resistance three.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:19]** That's cool.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** The abyssinian filter is

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:32]** For one hour, after you consume it, your natural weapons and unarmed attacks have a faint radiation.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:36]** So there's a slight glow to whatever you're using.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:47]** And a creature you hit with your natural weapons or unarmed attack must succeed at a fortitude saving throw, DC 10 plus half your level, plus your key ability score, or become sickened for one round.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:52]** So you can do a lot with that.

**[00:48:52 - 00:49:18]** um what's the ring of resistance uh the it's a mark two ring of resistance it adds plus two to your lowest uh your lowest save i believe grants you magic protection against attacks and effects to which you are particularly vulnerable you gain an enhancement bonus with your to your lowest base saving throw bonus

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:44]** you have two that are low you select which category when you first put on it and it doesn't change unless later something becomes lower right so you get to choose two and then if one of them goes up or you know yeah yeah and then we give you these things up yeah I will take


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:52]** Was there something else that somebody saw narrator?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** There wasn't anything in the hallway.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:58]** I don't think you all have looked in the actual lounge that they were in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:03]** Rick picks up the apprehension, um, class grappler pole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:11]** Uh, I'll take one of those tonics if no one's gonna take it, but I'm also gonna just look around in this other room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** You start walking through.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:19]** I think Colin would grab the other tonic and also check their armor.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** Like what armor they're wearing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** They are wearing.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** Good question.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Let me.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:28]** If any.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:30]** Resize my one note.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:31]** Nothing.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** They're naked.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:34]** I mean, reptoids could have a natural armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:38]** Oh, I mean, sure.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:41]** But no, these definitely have armor.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:43]** It is basically a temple weave.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** Basic lashing time wave doctor.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:53]** Okay, you start walking through Into this lounge.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** This is a staff lounge for sure.

**[00:50:54 - 00:51:06]** This is where they want to chill You can see in the corner and in the top You see a mat Where that's a padded mat and there's a bit of exercise equipment.

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:13]** There's like a hanging bag It's a pretty big room 20 by 60 maybe

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:26]** And at the top is that mat you see along the East wall, there are two vending machines and you recognize these as like fusion fizz.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:40]** So if you put on your book to hat, you all found some, uh, some fusion fizz drinks like, uh, the, the star stone apple, Leovara lush skitter rocket blast and a great Fanta.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:41]** Um,

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:56]** So you will recall that those drinks, whoever is their supplier, you have found them somehow both on a gray outpost and in Terrapin where there are Reptoids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:56 - 00:52:01]** Is this supplier the Pepsi of Starfinder or the Coke?

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:03]** The Pepsi of Starfinder or the Coke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:09]** Whichever one is more nefarious.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** That would be Pepsi.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:15]** You also see an interesting thing.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:17]** But Fanta is a Coke product.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** Anyways.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:21]** So there's a long bench next to you, Dr. OK.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:27]** And then to the west a little bit, there's a circular table where people can sit.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** And there's a couch and a TV on the other side.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:33]** That table has some sort of game on it.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Give me a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:46]** That is a culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** 22, 22.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** Nice.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:50]** You needed a 20.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** That's good.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:55]** You recognize this as, this is really cool.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:59]** This is the Imperial conquest game.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:03]** It's a strategy game in star finder.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:11]** It is an ancient board game with deceptively simple rules and great strategic depth.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:15]** And it's played typically via a holographic interface.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:17]** There's a real board here.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:21]** Up to four people can play, takes about 30 minutes per player.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:30]** At the end of an uninterrupted game, each character attempts a DC 20 intelligence check.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:43]** And if you succeed, you gain tactical insights for the next eight hours because you get a plus one bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:53]** And if two players who succeed at the check flank the same enemy, the bonus to attack rolls goes up by one.

**[00:53:54 - 00:54:01]** So if you all play for 30 minutes at any point, those players will get a plus one to AOO.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:05]** If two players play and flank, then they will get a plus one bonus to their attack rolls.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** Well, I'm going to snag that board for later.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:37]** interesting thing about the board is that you notice that there are pieces there you know typically there's pieces that might have uh packed worlds like uh known factions right there in addition to the abadar core and the knights of of uh the knights of hell and like those groups there are unseen aka gray and reptoids and

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:43]** And they're made from somebody who is very familiar with the unseen.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:52]** It's not like a lot of other conspiracy things where, you know, people will just make stuff up and come up with conjecture based on conjecture.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:55]** No, it's like, this is like very anatomically correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** Snagging that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:59 - 00:54:59]** Snag it.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:02]** Ah, another fold to the conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:28]** three times cryo david specified three times so good the game is called conspiracy and it just has three folds to close the board yeah it's a three-fold board um dr k you're about to walk out and you're like all right you know as you're reaching over

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:40]** putting the third fold in the board, and you put it in the box, and one of the pieces falls out onto the table, bounces on the table, bounces on the floor.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:44]** Walk over, scoot the chairs.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:48]** You bend down, and you put your tentacle on the couch.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:49]** Reach under.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:51]** It's gone under the couch, of course.

**[00:55:52 - 00:56:00]** You pull it out, and as you stand up, you see that there is a book upside down.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:27]** on the couch well i'm gonna check out what that book is naturally come on now it is a copy and on the front in let's say 60s retro future font so slightly angled it says integrated future manifesto


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:33]** I'm going to thumb through the table of contents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:37]** It is well thumbed through and well read.

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:40]** The pages look like they have been marked up.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:41]** Who's it written by?

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** Little references.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:45]** Any author listed?

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:45]** No name.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:47]** Any ISBN?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:49]** ISBN?

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** No.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:55]** I'm going to, out of character, take this moment to remind ourselves of the NanoVenture.

**[00:56:55 - 00:57:04]** And the Integrated Future Front, who staged all of that to drag us into some sort of portal for our nanites.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:12]** And how I believe this manifesto is their guiding document.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:15]** I know how to get there.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:19]** Kara knows that there is a potential that the leader has been assassinated.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** That's what my notes say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:27]** Yeah, the IFF, if you will recall, for those listeners who might have skipped the NanoVenture, or it's been a minute.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:29]** I mean, it's also been a minute for us, too.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:37]** So, the IFF, if I pull up my... Where's my book that has it?

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:43]** Dr. K, as you're thumbing through, you think that you see...

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:52]** many disparate chapters about different parts of the packed worlds.

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:01]** And then you start to see chapters about means and methods, let's say.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:04]** How to get things done.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:10]** The IFF, as a reminder, loose organization in general.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:13]** Not specifically, not local here.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:43]** loose organization of precogs and witch warpers the founder or founders at some point were supposedly hurled into another reality where they glimpsed a utopia free from strife and hunger and albeit a brief time these seers as you start to thumb through you notice there's a reference to the seers capital S a lot and

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:47]** They came away with these revelations about what needs to change.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:51]** And even just looking through quickly, this is a mix.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:57]** Some planets, it talks very generally about the state of politics in this utopia.

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:09]** And in some, it's very in-depth about the way that a building is shaped or what the wife of this leader, their name is.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:27]** And at first you're like, this is not related, but you can tell that whoever's been reading through this is coursing through it, is finding connections, is underlining words, counting in the sides, writing in the margins.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:30]** Yeah.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:34]** And you think, you know, the IFF as of late has become two things.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:49]** One, it has become a bit of a galvanizing group for people who are alt to a lot of the politics throughout the Pact world because the IFF is ready to actualize some of these things from the future.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:54]** In the past, you know, five, ten years, it's been really starting to make changes.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:59]** and trying to say this is what our manifesto says the future to lead us there.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** Everyone is welcome here in the future.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:04]** Take a look and see what it says exactly.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:19]** The dangerous thing is that they also have become, you know, somewhat of a terrorist organization and a threat, because if that if the name of that spouse is different, well, then maybe their current spouse needs to go.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** Right.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:24]** And some things are small and sometimes they make the news.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:36]** It's interesting because I've also heard to make predictions and you don't see that in the book, but you just remember in your head occasionally, you know, it's like a pop-up ad that everyone pays for on those like not great websites.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:41]** It's like IFF has predicted that this will happen in like a few months time or next week.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** And sometimes it comes true and sometimes it doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:49]** Well, I'm snagging the book and I'm going to read it later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:50]** Yeah.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:53]** Snag, snag the book.

**[01:00:53 - 01:01:02]** Here's you see that there is another message coming through on the comm unit.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** Not great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:31]** do you ignore the call again do you or do you try to a call or a message there's a there's there's like a call coming through oh well i mean at this same page as last time okay i already know just put it on speakerphone yeah put it on speakerphone okay he puts it on speakerphone okay puts on speakerphone there's some static for a second


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:40]** And then you hear a familiar voice.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:44]** Efecta's face looks concerned.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:49]** Dr. Okatis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:52]** It's the voice of Dr. Nobens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:57]** I... I realize...

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:03]** Now, where I know you from, it was always on the tip of my tongue.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:10]** And let me tell you, Doctor, okay?

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:14]** You remind me so much of him.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:21]** But you are nothing like Dr. Boustakis.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** And you never will be.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:33]** and no discovery or paper or thought in your head will rival his genius.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** And the line goes short.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:45]** He just looks at Doctor, okay.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:47]** Sorry, I don't know how to spell Boudakas.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:48]** B-O-U-J.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:50]** D-A-K-A-S.

**[01:02:50 - 01:02:51]** B-O-U-J.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:53]** Dang, I missed that.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:57]** Anyways, it's probably still wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:02:57 - 01:03:10]** Wow, what a... Doctor Nodens continues to up the level of being a total... Sorry, but... She is an absolute... Doctor Nodens is a reptoid, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:13]** Was she nice when you knew her before she was a Reptoid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** You talking to me?

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:18]** That was the first time that I had met her.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:24]** I had known about her, but that was the first time that I had gone to meet her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:30]** I'm also caught up on the fact that now the Reptoids have said several times that they want me alive.

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:32]** And you as well, Dr. O'Kay.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:36]** They stopped and allowed us to live.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:40]** I mean, Dr. O'Kay, did he overhear this through the halls?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:40 - 01:04:05]** yeah okay i think you did i your your your pawn your token is in the other room but i'm i'm assuming that you grabbed the book and walked out the door to the south and as you walk out you hear that melodic like voice infuriating voice oh this all right these these reptoids are with us i think it's time we start back


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:11]** But I'm also trying to piece together what their relation to the Greys are.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:15]** And do Reptoids have a history with fighting the Greys?

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:16]** Is that a thing?

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:19]** I know it's all unknown to the normal person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:21]** Right.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:24]** Do we roll culture checks for this?

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:24]** What's the move?

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:26]** How do we figure out if we know this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:34]** In the Imperial Conquest game that was laid out on the table,

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:50]** Was there any sort of indication, based on where the pieces were, that there might have been an alliance between players in that game playing as the Unseen and the Reptoids?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:57]** You mean an alliance between the Greys and the Reptoid players?

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:59]** Yeah.

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:04]** Let's roll a chance cube.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:08]** A chance cube, a chance cube.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** Yes.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:16]** But you also know... I mean, that could be a strategic alliance that's temporary.

**[01:05:16 - 01:05:18]** Exactly, exactly.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:18]** Yeah.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:21]** I mean, somebody could give me a culture check if they want to.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** I'll try culture.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:28]** I rolled a one, so... Just a minute.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:31]** Here's this so cultured sarcasm.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:31]** 26.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:34]** 26 from here.

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:34]** Something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:40]** Yeah, that was a nine out of the die for... 16.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:43]** 16.

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:45]** Okay.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:47]** Dr. K, did you roll one?

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:49]** Yeah, I rolled a natural one.

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:50]** Natural one.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:51]** Okay.

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:52]** For a total of 43.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:53]** 26, though.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:54]** Yeah.

**[01:05:55 - 01:05:55]** Yeah.

**[01:05:57 - 01:06:17]** hears you're thinking about it and yeah you recall from some random website that here's just some youtube video of someone named like like uh you know theory junk 213 is uh posting their their second video ever

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:22]** And it's just them with a phone talking in a room and they're only lit by their computer, right?

**[01:06:23 - 01:06:33]** And you recall from that knowing that the greys and the reptoids have hated each other for a long, long time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_10

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:49]** Uh, here's, here's mentions like from everything that I've read, which isn't much, but, um, I've, I've seen media that indicates that they have been long, long time enemies.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:52]** It's just speculation, but that's what I've heard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:53]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:55]** Effective speaks up.

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:55]** Yeah.

**[01:06:58 - 01:06:59]** Not many people know that.

**[01:06:59 - 01:06:59]** He is.

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:04]** I know that because Zitch knows that.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:06]** You got to meet Zitch.

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:08]** How does Zitch know that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:20]** which is somebody that would post a late night video, you know, 3am only lit by their computer trying to talk about new things that they found.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:29]** But of course they would put it on some, uh, secret site and then they would bury that URL or a link to that in the park.

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:31]** And then they would put a code to that somewhere on the website.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:33]** You know, they're, they're pretty deep in it.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:38]** But, uh, I have to say, I, I kind of believe them now after everything here.

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:40]** Anyway, are we f***ing them up or what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:07:43 - 01:07:51]** Certainty of death near success parameters are minor.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:52]** What are we waiting for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:54 - 01:07:55]** Okay.

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:55]** Let's do it.

**[01:07:55 - 01:07:57]** Never tell me the odds.

**[01:07:58 - 01:07:59]** She's got on her second skin.

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:00]** Who's going first?

**[01:08:00 - 01:08:04]** There are... In the hallway, there are...

**[01:08:04 - 01:08:05]** five doors.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:08]** There's a double door that Brick came out of.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:16]** That is directly next to you, and there are three doors down the hall on the left and one on the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:27]** Rick is going to step up first, and then he's going to tell the others, like, I suggest that we spread out so we do not get pinned up like we were in the last fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:27]** Okay.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:29]** Agreed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:08:31 - 01:08:33]** Should we check this room with the double doors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:34]** Opposite, Rick.

**[01:08:34 - 01:08:35]** on that door.

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:38]** I'll check with Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:39]** Standing by.

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:46]** And Rick lifts up his the new capture pole that he grabbed.

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:50]** Okay.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:50]** Okay.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:53]** He looks around and he waits for everybody to kind of settle.

**[01:08:53 - 01:08:55]** And then he's going to just three count it.

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:56]** Three, two, one.

**[01:08:57 - 01:08:58]** And click the door open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:59 - 01:09:01]** And he clicks the door open.

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:04]** Go ahead and click it again.

**[01:09:04 - 01:09:05]** I tried.

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:06]** It's not.

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:09]** Oh.

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:12]** Immediately you can see Rick and hear us.

**[01:09:14 - 01:09:20]** It's immediately apparent that this room has alien computers and communications tech.

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:25]** There are two workstations on each side.

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:28]** Sorry, one on the right, three on the left.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:37]** And there's just a constant hum of view screens, communications equipment, racks of computers.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:47]** But it's a big room with a single light shining down in the middle and a bunch of other lights in the ceiling that are off.

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:54]** My friends, you are at the Computer Core.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:56]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:09:58 - 01:10:00]** What happens at the computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:02]** Don't go there.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:02]** Don't go to the computer.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:04]** It's a very small building.

**[01:10:04 - 01:10:06]** It's just files.

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:07]** Some bunk beds and a computer.

**[01:10:07 - 01:10:08]** But where are the files?

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:09]** Are they in the computer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:10 - 01:10:11]** No.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:12]** Definitely not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:13 - 01:10:15]** Is this a school for ants?

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:17]** Is this a school for ants?

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:20]** Is this a reptoid base for a reptoid ant?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:20 - 01:10:21]** You can't read good.

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:23]** You want to do other stuff good too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:25]** Is this a reptoid base for Newt?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:10:26 - 01:10:27]** What is this?

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:28]** Uh...
