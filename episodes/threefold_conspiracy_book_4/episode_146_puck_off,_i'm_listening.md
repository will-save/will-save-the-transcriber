## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:19]** Can you all hear this music?

**[00:01:20 - 00:01:20]** Because I can't.

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:22]** Do you hear any music?

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:22]** Oh.

**[00:01:22 - 00:01:23]** I'm not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:23 - 00:01:24]** I'm also not on audio movers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:25]** Sorry, that's my bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:28]** I see very low meters bouncing.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:47]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** Wow.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** It was an RKO out of nowhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** That is how we start the episode.

**[00:01:54 - 00:02:00]** Just clipped audio and shouts and loud stuff all the time.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** That's how I'm feeling right now.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:04]** I'm feeling like things are popping off in different places.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** I'm your listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** Clipping waves and rolling saves.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** That's all we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** Dude, that was so good.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** You didn't even use chat GPT for that.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:16]** I am your listening GM, listening to my beautiful friends make poetry here.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:19]** We got our poet, Here's, played by Kelly.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:21]** We got our poet, Colin, played by Benny.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** Our poet, Dr. OK, played by Will.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:25]** And our poet, Brick19, played by Kevin.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** A little more prose on Brick19.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** He doesn't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:32]** Because you need charisma to do poetry?

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Is that what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:37]** And you do have a minus, too, to a lot of sensitive emotion.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** Yeah.

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:40]** EQ checks.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Dude, this is episode 146.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:42]** It is.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Do y'all realize how close we are to 150?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:46]** What happens at 150?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:48]** 150.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** We're not too long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:51]** Four away.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** Good math.

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** Nice.

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** I was really deep in that.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** That was great.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** They're adding in unknown treasures and we'll save.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:02]** No, no, no.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** This is just straight we'll save.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** Strictly we'll save the podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:06]** What happens at 150?

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:06]** This is where I want to ask.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:07]** Threefold conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:10]** The question is, is Nano Adventures included in the 146?

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:12]** Nano Adventures is included.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** Yeah, because it was released in line with this.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:17]** Question is, what happened in episode 50?

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** And 100.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:18]** 50.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:24]** Oh, it's probably buried.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:24]** Sorry.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:25]** Crits happen.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** 2022.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:27]** 50.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:32]** A couple of crits against an enemy with weakness.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:39]** And investigation of the comms, you get a message from the stewards saying there's illegal activity.

**[00:03:39 - 00:04:04]** the stewards the stewards what about that that was free of any right um that i remember that guardian bot and that was and you you didn't let us know that crits did extra damage until it was too late and we were already almost dead i did yeah yeah i did yep uh 100 oh this was some nano adventure times

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:04]** Yeah.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:10]** Oh, it's, it's, it's when y'all were going into the library or as Kevin wrote a book warehouse.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:14]** Um, and then I'm just joking.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** It was more of a warehouse.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:19]** It was, I'm just kidding.

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** Uh, uh, and then you were fighting the Shabbat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** Yeah.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** The sniper.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:30]** Yeah.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:34]** So kind of, kind of, kind of big things.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:34]** Nothing crazy, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:37]** But, you know, we'll see what happens.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** We'll see what happens.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:41]** I think no offense, but like that Shabbat kind of was like...

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:53]** anticlimactic and only because the only Shabbat we knew before that was played by Jason Keighley.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** Very high bar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:56 - 00:05:01]** Jason Keighley plays a Shabbat in one of our shows.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** And the thing is that you will never talk to this.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:04]** He is the creator of Unknown Treasures.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** He is the writer of Unknown Treasures.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Junkers Delight.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:11]** But you didn't talk to this Shabbat because I had Jason Keeley waiting in the wings ready.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:14]** If you were to ask a question, he would have just phoned in.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** I would have been like, all right, call in.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:17]** I did not know that.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** And then he would have had it ready to go.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:22]** So that's the thing is that you killed him before it was too late.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:22]** Yeah.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:25]** He had a lot of things to say, a lot of hopes and aspirations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:26]** It was the same guy?

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** It was supposed to be the same Shabbat?

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** No, it was not.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:29]** Oh, okay.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** Too small of a world.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** Yeah, no, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** It was his brother?

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** Any predictions for 150?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:57]** uh i think at 150 the script flips and we become the antagonist and find like another group of adventurers to terrorize maybe so like the three the third fold is that we're the villains the whole time yeah it's possible the third fold is that there are three potential fathers


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:02]** Who's the child?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** Who is the child?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Which fold is the real dad?

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:15]** I was going to go with the serious route and be like, we're probably going to still be in a fight with Orvier or Pike because I feel like that fight's coming up and it's going to take 15 episodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** It was a tough fight in the hallway.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** Kelly?

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:22]** This AI thing is going to drop some more truth bombs on us.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** I would like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:24]** There is.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:27]** We'll get to that in a minute.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:33]** I put out an all call for some banter and sentences, so I want to get to that real quick.

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:35]** Thank you for answering the call.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** Thank you for answering the signal.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:50]** Ko-fi.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:58]** Literally, however you want to spell it.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** I can't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:00]** I think it's KO-NY.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:05]** Yeah, but if you even do, like, I'm feeling coffee, that would work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** Or coffee, like the drink.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:08]** Yeah.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:11]** Yeah.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** Yeah.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:20]** Willsave is pretty expensive to put on on a monthly basis, so we appreciate any and all help in this endeavor from our listeners.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:27]** Yeah, there are a lot of places that you can spend your hard-earned money, and we appreciate it if you are a supporter currently or if you want to be.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** We definitely appreciate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:33]** And we kind of have aspirations to make a second show and do some other cool stuff.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:36]** We just kind of need funding for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:41]** Well, that was a good round table of like, oh, this and then this and then this.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:43]** We all said something that was nice.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:44]** We didn't practice that.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** Give us your money.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:52]** He's constantly making fun of us.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:53]** Burning us?

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** No, there's another term.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:59]** He's the top at everything, basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** Top G.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:03]** Another thing that you can do, I forget which tier it's at.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:05]** I think it's the $7 tier.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:12]** You can write in sentences that we will read here in the show or banter topics for us to talk about.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:14]** And I do have a banter topic.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:17]** And I think some of you will be pleased.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:23]** This banter topic is coming from our awesome supporter, TacoMonk or Kyle.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:23]** Thank you.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:25]** That's what they wrote.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:28]** And the banter topic is this.

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:39]** In honor of Andor ending, who is a great unsung hero in your life that you would like to give a shout out on the podcast for?

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:43]** What did they do or do they do for you?

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:49]** And he says, please don't say the word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:56]** I'm going to let y'all go first because mine is really sappy and serious, and I don't want to ruin the vibe.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:57]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** Dude, that's not ruining the vibe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** That is the vibe, but go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** It's going to be hard to follow Vinny.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:04]** Yeah, so you go last.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:05]** I'll go first.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:12]** I have a Navy friend that he kind of always caught a bad rap from everybody else, but...

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** he was always there for me.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:16]** And actually now that I think about it, I had a few of them.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** So I'm gonna throw out two.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:21]** Caleb and my buddy, Dan Brown.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** Those two guys.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** No, he's actually unrelated to the author.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** It's different.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** There's a lawsuit going on.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** It's copyrighted.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:33]** Both these guys are like oddballs.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:43]** They're the goofy friend and kind of got picked on by other people, which sucks because they're really cool and really have the biggest hearts.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:49]** Both those guys have stuck their arm out for me when they didn't need to and saved me from some really bad times.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** I really appreciate them as humans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** That's really sweet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:57]** Yeah, but the show is kind of about how he's behind the scenes.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:59]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:37]** Well, I guess I'll choose some IRL friends too.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:42]** So probably I got to do both of them.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:48]** So that would be Jong and Brandon, who are two close friends that I've had for a long time.

**[00:12:49 - 00:12:51]** And especially Jong goes way back.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:54]** You know, you have friends that just have zero ego.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:59]** They're not like they just truly, truly want the best for you.

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:18]** um and are rooting for you constantly and are always there for you and those those are two swell guys and uh and i know that they listen from time to time so what's up youtube shout out to y'all yeah yeah wow john you gonna go before vinnie go ahead you sure

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:20]** John is a better one than Vinny.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:21]** No.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** It's the opposite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** Wow.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:26]** John has a better one.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** They're going to say each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:31]** They're going to be like, oh, I had a friend when I was six.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:36]** There's a friend who cured cancer on me.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:39]** There's a friend who saved my life.

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** Actually, you probably have any at some point.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** I can probably think a few times.

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:49]** But no, I'm having the opposite problem where I'm trying to think of unsung heroes.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:54]** So people that don't get enough credit or shout out or love.

**[00:13:54 - 00:14:05]** And it's not that I don't have those people in my life, but it's that I feel like I try and be present and an active listener to a lot of people and chat with them.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** So I feel bad.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** I feel like I can't think of any...

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:14]** anybody in particular that fits this exact mold per se that's unsung.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:19]** Did you write a song about everybody in your life and that's why they're not unsung?

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:21]** Because you sing about them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:24]** Because I memorialize them in songs?

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** No, but I could.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** Thanks.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** I was trying.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:31]** I was stretching it.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:33]** You were stretching a lot.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** Go ahead, Vinny, because I feel like a lame duck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:49]** Um, yeah, so, uh, Dr. Wayne Muir, when I, when I first started at Jacksonville university, I, it was my first like real, like formal office job.

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:59]** Um, and every day I came in, I was just kind of like trying to figure out my role in the university and like in that team and like in life.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:04]** And I'm not kidding every day I would sit down and the first hour of every day was sat.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:17]** in Wayne's office talking about everything and nothing at all from like life problems and relationships to like, how do you operate in a professional environment?

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** What does this mean?

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:20]** And like, how do you build relationships?

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:27]** And like my time spent with him was so valuable to me and to my own personal growth.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:32]** Wayne passed away a week ago.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:35]** Oh, bummer.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:42]** And so, like, he was so kind and so generous with his time.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:49]** And, like, so it was such a joy to be around and had such a heart for me and for the rest of the students that we were working with.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:54]** And, like, so, yeah, this shout out goes out to you, Wayne.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** I heard that happening, man.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:42]** I'm sorry.

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** I saw another person, too, I wanted to shout out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:46]** Go for it.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Send it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:52]** His name is Colonel Pedro Ruston.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:58]** He was a Cuban refugee who I met when I was in D.C.,

**[00:17:58 - 00:18:01]** And he became a colonel in the Air Force.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:03]** And he's just the f***ing coolest guy.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:07]** And he died just a few years ago.

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:10]** But from cancer, which sucks.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:10]** Oh, dude.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** F***ing cancer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** F***ing cancer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:22]** But he was pretty inspirational, too, because he had some dope f***ing stories about breaking out of prison in Cuba and rescuing his dad.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:26]** And the f***ing dude was like Captain Cuba.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:27]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Captain Cuba.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:32]** That's awesome.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:36]** And he loved his family down there and stuff.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** Yeah.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:41]** Obviously, the political situation wasn't great.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:43]** Right.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:43]** Right.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** Yeah.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:45]** Well, for sure.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** Well, that's a big shout out.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** That's a big shout out.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:53]** He's still got a pretty sick... If anyone ever wants to look it up.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:55]** Yes.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:56]** His obituary is pretty...

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** He was an epic dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** Post it here if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:07]** Pedro Luis Rustam.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** I will read that.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:16]** I think it's in the Washington Post for real.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:17]** It was in the Washington Post?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:18]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:19]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:33]** I just want to say real quick that I don't, Vinny, to your point earlier, just the person that I was thinking of, Shirley Sachs, I just want to say I don't think I would be the person or the performer or the person like on stage that it would be without her.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:38]** She was very influential for us in terms of theater and getting you to be the person that you want to be.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:40]** And Vinny got to meet her a bunch.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:43]** And yeah, also passed away because of cancer.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:46]** So, cancer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:48]** answer.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** Sorry, man.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** And pretty recently too, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** Yeah, last year.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** We'll send that link.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** I want to read that after this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:58]** Sent in our studio chat.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:58]** Killer.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:01]** This was introduced actually on the floor of Congress, I think.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:05]** But here's the Washington Post article.

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:07]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:07]** Well, we are pouring one out.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** Thank you, Takuma.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:10]** That was a...

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:16]** That was a great banter topic in honor of a lot of people.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:22]** I hope everyone takes the time to think about some people that are maybe unsung in their life and tell them while you still can.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:26]** Or find a way to honor them in the best way that you can.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:28]** Reach out to their friends or family.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** Never hold in a compliment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Never hold in a compliment.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:33]** I love you all.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** That's my compliment to you all.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** You guys are fantastic.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:36]** I don't want to not tell you.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** So I'm telling you that I love you all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** We love you, too.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:42]** What's up?

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:43]** Are you okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** Are you going to disappear?

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:44]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:44]** No.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** Oh, no.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:45]** I'm good.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** I'm good.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:47]** I just wanted to say it.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:48]** Benny was like, don't hold a compliment.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:51]** I just want to say this is such a nice space to be in.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:53]** All right.

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:58]** Well, now that we've all poured, there's a lot of liquid on the floor around all of us.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:59]** This is important.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:02]** Yeah.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Let's go ahead and get started.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:05]** Book three.

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:33]** You all, I think we're at a sweet spot in book three, not just because this very wholesome and important banter, but because I think, I feel like this is where threefold, like the adventure as a whole book three for sure.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:38]** And the adventure as a whole begins to shift.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:44]** I think it begins to open up.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:47]** Kev, you look like you want to say something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:50]** No, I'm just very curious where your head... I was like, what do you mean shift?

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** Are we going into another fold here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:56]** Is this going to be... Is this the shift into the sixth fold?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:57]** Another fold to the conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:01 - 00:22:02]** Oh, we do have a sentence.

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** We do have a sentence.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:03]** Hang on.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** I want to make sure that we get the sentence out.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:08]** I'm going to roll real quick to see who gets the sentence out.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** All right, so back to the episode.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:07]** Yeah, like I said, this is, I think, the time when the adventure starts to shift and begins to open up because you have now come to Terrapin

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:12]** kind of as like for a grab bag of reasons, right?

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:14]** Like this is a way off world.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** This is a place of refuge.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:17]** This is a place where communications are headed.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:25]** This is a path to the stewards, to the reptoids, to whoever they are, and maybe answers, right?

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:34]** Answers to some questions about where you've come from, about what's been happening to you the past few days, about what happened to you on The Void Crier,

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:39]** And along the way, you discovered, like, new things.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:41]** The mystery of Palace Obscura.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:46]** The respite and relief after 24 hours at Corundum.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** A little bit of, like, a beach day.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:54]** And finally, you know, the Pandora's box that is Terrapin Station.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** So...

**[00:23:57 - 00:24:02]** After battling and killing real Reptoids, right?

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:26]** The second checkbox in your list of conspiracy alien Pokedexes that you're, you know, confirming first Greys and now Reptoids, you all make your way after a tough battle into the central control chamber where you meet the listener and this being

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:32]** is cordial, clear, but feels off.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:40]** You know, he gives these promises of, I can provide you answers if I have a trade.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:53]** And Colin, you decide to give and share a memory and a tune of you and I think your father eating ice cream, right?

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** Yeah.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:54]** Kind of, yeah.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:55]** Yeah.

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:57]** Tough to remember though, because you lost it.

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:22]** you failed your will save and you lost that memory it's no longer oh that's rad you all ask the listener a bit about terrapin you start kind of working on what are questions i can ask calling immediately out the gate where is my sister why is her name on the cots

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** Asking, how do we get off?

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:26]** Well, the Void Criers here.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:30]** Rick asking, well, where is Orvier here in the hangar?

**[00:25:31 - 00:25:35]** Where is Colin's potential partner, Kaniko Breeze?

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:39]** You asked, what do you have on us?

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:41]** An effecta.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:45]** And that's when things started to get a little...

**[00:25:46 - 00:26:02]** Interesting, a little spicy as it's revealed that there are files on you from the past 48 hours being doctored to look like you are aggressive.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** You're fighting on the Void Crier.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** You're shooting the Pyke's Paratons.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:08]** You're attacking the stewards.

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** You're scheming in your room.

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:16]** Making it look like you are aggressive individuals attacking stewards.

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:19]** And then Hears begins to ask an interesting question.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:25]** But does so privately, telepathically.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:27]** Saying, hey, can you keep things a secret?

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** Can you talk telepathically?

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** And the listener's like, yeah, I can.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:38]** And you ask telepathically about Shira Dawnbreaker.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:42]** You ask about Roloo

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:51]** And then, and then the listener is like, ah, wait a minute.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** This is curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** What is this?

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** It is, it is resonating with me.

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** I can, I can feel it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:04]** I didn't realize this before.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:08]** And you look down here and.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:16]** Wherever you keep your puck, the blue puck, it is glowing.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** In his pants.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** Yeah.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** In his pants.

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:20]** Right in his pants.

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:21]** Yeah, right.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** Just a front thing.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:24]** Yeah, right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** Yeah.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** His bulge is now glowing.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** He's a little embarrassed.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:32]** So he covers it with his hands and then he asks this construct.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:37]** He's like, do you know what this is and what it does?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:42]** Which is ironic because I think Rick, like you're saying that telepathically to the listener, right?

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** Yeah.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** Are you saying that?

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:54]** And I think Rick, Rick would say it out loud as if not necessarily to the listener, but like, and by quote unquote, I'm just the listeners throwing me off.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:56]** Cause like our listeners are not.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:58]** I'm sorry.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** It's just... Anyways.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:01]** Wait, what?

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:09]** Because the thing is called The Listener, and it's like, oh, so I'm talking to The Listener, but I'm talking to this thing, not our listeners.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** English is a hard language.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:10]** The Listener.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:11]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:19]** Anyway, so Rick... I think Rick out loud would be like, what is that that is glowing and here's his pants?

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:25]** And he's saying it out loud just like as a thought, but I think the listener would probably perceive it as a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:27]** Benny, call him.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:55]** uh just clarifying question to Sharon blush I don't think so that's a fun question but um I don't think that they have blood vessels on because they don't really have skin it's like a carapace I think yeah why do you ask just imagine it would be a blushing right yeah yeah just imagine the scenario where like your pants start like the party and your pants starts glowing and then Rick is like what's happening in his pants

**[00:28:55 - 00:29:16]** it could be anything could be and here's just looks over sheepishly here's has not told us about this puck at all right that's not true you were there it has come up before yeah um in a limited way it's come up yeah it has yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:23]** Oh, because you brought it up when you tried to make the key thing glow, right?

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:27]** Or like you tried something with the key from the chimera?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:28]** I don't know.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:32]** That was when it glowed.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Sounds familiar.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:33]** The first time.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Yeah, doesn't it?

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** Yeah, because there were those metal objects that we got.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:42]** It also glowed in book two when you all were around this.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:44]** Another similar piece of metal.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:48]** I think that one said necrol.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** I believe that was the time when it glowed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:52 - 00:30:14]** notes thanks for taking the notes what um what is so in my notes what's that in your pants here's i was i was hoping you could tell me i don't know that i can see what it is it just looks blue oh well here's takes it out

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:17]** and holds it up.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:20]** You guys have seen this already, but tell us.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:21]** Put it in a safe direction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:27]** Just as a reminder, let me bring you guys in Foundry to where we are.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:38]** The room that you're in is... was pretty much just a standard control room.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:41]** And then as soon as Colin, you traded that memory...

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:58]** then the room shifted into this blue hexagonal, slowly moving light on the floor and all these purple and blue lines, almost as if you're like exploding and looking into a map or some sort of database.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:08]** And you surmise last time, Dr. Okay, that this was not only a database of some sort, but it was also like a file containment system and a map.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:10]** So it's like a geolocated map of things.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:39]** data this is a data observatory so as you hold this up here so you're standing in front of the door then the lights kind of shift over and look at the puck ah this is oh cool it's i can feel it it's resonating with me let me scan it

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:46]** And then there's like some sound and some clear information being traveled through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:59]** I, from optical scans alone, I, I can tell that whatever this material is, it's not in the current standard database.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:03]** It's like, it's magically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:06]** Latent.

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:12]** And there's like a savoriness that comes with that term, magically latent.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:22]** And the listener says, let me do a little research.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:33]** And then says, while I'm researching, I have to say, this is new for


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:46]** I feel a resonance with the four of you, Dr. O.K.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:48]** and Rick and Colin and Hears.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** Our resonance together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:16]** And all of you feel this pull in your gut, this like a slight compulsion to turn your attention to the people around you, to feel what they're feeling, to like actively acknowledge them and passively.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:20]** It feels pleasant.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:25]** I want you guys to give me a will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:27]** Will save!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** I don't trust this thing.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:38]** Ah, 16.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** Just gonna roll a little willy.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** 17 on the die for a total of 22.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:42]** 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:50]** 18 on the die for a 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:52]** 22, colon 27.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Where did my Hero Lab go?

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** Here's, you got a, what, 17?

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:56]** 16.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:59]** 16, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:03]** Yeah.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** Yes.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:09]** Where is my Hero Lab tab?

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:11]** Hero Lab tab.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:14]** rolled a 14.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** 14, okay.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:23]** Rick and Colin, would you... Would your characters...

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:55]** be interested in this feeling like would you kind of give in in that moment when so it's a bit like when you're trying to to meditate when you're trying to focus but it feels pleasant it's like calming would would you all kind of give in and be interested in in this connection with your other party members or would you wall it off a little bit and no you know kind of like i don't i'm a little shy or tentative about giving into this


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:58 - 00:35:15]** I think Rick would have no qualms of meditating and joining with these three people, but I think he is apprehensive against this quote-unquote listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:17]** Yeah, you don't feel it so much with the listener.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** You do acknowledge it.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:27]** It's like acknowledging that there's another presence in the room, but you don't feel the same strength of connection that you do with the other three of you.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:31]** That feels like a real, genuine connection.

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:40]** of positive acknowledgement, of seeing somebody, of materializing your connection with them.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:43]** It suddenly feels tangible where it might not have before.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:45]** This might be a new feeling for some of you.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** I don't know.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** So that's kind of what I'm asking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:51]** What is this feeling so sudden and new?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:56]** I think Rick would kind of like pause for a second and like, you know, cause he's resisting it.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** Like he's, he's got resistance to it.

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:00]** And I think, is this a mind effect?

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:02]** Cause I technically have a plus two against that then.

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** Anyways.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:04]** Cause of constructs.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** Yay.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** But I think he would,

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:14]** He would kind of look at the faces of the other three and recognize that they're following into this.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:17]** And I think that would give him comfort.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** Colin, are you also following?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:25]** I think Colin would approach this feeling with cautious curiosity.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:31]** Like, I don't know if this is a sensation that he's felt since his sister died.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:42]** And so, like, I don't know what the feeling is, like, mechanically or narratively, but it sounds similar to his bond with his sister.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** And so, like...

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:56]** there's a cautious optimism because I don't think he wants to hurt or be hurt again, but also like it's, it's a hole that's been in him for decades.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** That is like, yeah, sure.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:03]** I'm, I'm open to it, but let's, let's see what this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:04]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:07]** And here's, can I ask what your thoughts are on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:10]** What is this feeling like?

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** It's like a feeling as a flame.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:14]** Does it have a name?

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** We can hate each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:26]** No, seriously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** What is this feeling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:34]** It's like a genuine acknowledgement of seeing somebody for the first time.

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:36]** It's like seeing their true selves.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:40]** And there's a connection that you feel with somebody.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:46]** It's sort of like you're... It's not even positive.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:51]** It just is like a true seeing almost of the individual that's standing around you in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:57]** This is the write-in sentence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:07]** That was the right answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:09]** Is it Finder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** No, no, no.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:11]** It's not Finder?

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:15]** No, it was Taco Bell.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:16]** Thanks, Kyle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:17]** That is the sentence.

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:20]** I tried to deliver that as genuinely as I could.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:22]** It was great.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:22]** It was really nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:27]** Kyle, I really just want to say from the bottom of my heart, thank you for this episode.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:38]** Because we've gone from really deep feeling, handling some shit, shedding tears, to like, this is the write-in sentence.


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** You know what?

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** That's the standard range.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:44]** That's the range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:46]** Kyle spans it all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:46]** Thank you.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** He does.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:52]** Does that answer your question, Will?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:59]** It's a bit of a... Somebody gets to peer into my personality?

**[00:39:00 - 00:39:05]** No, they don't know any other information about you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:05]** There's nothing else.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:10]** It's just this genuine feeling of connection on a deep level.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** Are they reading my aura?

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:14]** Sure.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:20]** There's a little bit here where you characterize it in the way that you think you would or your character would.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:23]** But there is this seeing.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:27]** You're seeing somebody for the first time as they kind of really are.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:31]** And it's not necessarily good or bad.

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** It's just like, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:34]** So who am I seeing?

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** Rick, Colin, and here's.

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:39]** I'm seeing them as they truly are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:49]** Yeah, it's like that moment maybe where you are suddenly, like, you're thinking, like, wow, like, we have been through a lot, like, with these three other people.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:54]** Like, I have been through a lot of moments and tough stuff with them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:54 - 00:40:06]** And... So, would you say, like, it's more of a... Like...

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:19]** I guess not like a sudden revelation, but like more of an introspective kind of holistic view of the people I'm around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:23]** That might be how it manifests for you in Dr. Okay.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:23]** Sure.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:24]** Yeah.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:24]** Yeah.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** Yeah.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** It's this quiet realization.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** This is the right end sentence.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:32]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** This is the right sentence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** That's it.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:38]** Kyle just made Willa do a Pokemon at this point.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:40]** He's just going to repeat that phrase over and over.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** Cheers.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Oh, man.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** Do you want to share what you...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:46 - 00:41:12]** love how everyone's just like i don't know i don't know if i like these guys i don't know if i want to i know them and that's okay how i feel that's okay that that's your feelings are valid like oh well like yeah this how how your player character might feel about the others is it it might be a little at odds with like the seeing of them you know like it's not it's not a kumbaya positive moment it's just seeing them for who they are they're like deepest irl i


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:20]** IRL, I've been forced to have moments like this before through some guided experience.

**[00:41:21 - 00:41:23]** So personally, I'm okay with it, one.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:31]** And then two, I think here's just so interested in hearing, he's really open right now because he wants to know how this puck is.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** He's pretty receptive to what's going on.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:35]** So he'll do that.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:40]** He'll give into it and he'll walk over to Rick and be like, I see you, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:40 - 00:42:05]** just to be okay i'll just touch rick i think well one question is like is this is the this the response to the puck is what's causing this or you should ask the listener let's continue wait but before anything else happens uh like rick is just about to give in and commit to this but then he he pulls out his gun and cocks it and he says out loud to the listener like are we safe here

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** And he's going to point his gun at the door.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** He doesn't feel comfortable.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:18]** Like if we're all kind of like going into our minds, like that Rick has that one last like apprehension of like, what if this is a trap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:19]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** Do you feel unsafe, Rick?

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** You don't need to.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** I do feel vulnerable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:28]** That's okay.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:32]** I think I feel a little vulnerable.

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:34]** Do you want me to make this safer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:37]** Currently, the door to your north is locked.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:41]** The door behind here is not, nor is the one on the west.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** Would you like me to lock them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:45]** Yes.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:51]** They lock at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:53]** Why did we get locked in here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:54 - 00:43:13]** so that nothing else can come in wants to feel safe but yeah i'm gonna hug you rick i'm just gonna i'm gonna give you a safe hug okay and as you have i'll just embrace the hug i'll unpause it so you can move your thing over yeah as you as you hug him or like around the waist he's got his gun up pointed at the door just locked

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:17]** And you just see him uncock it, put it in safe, and then lower it down.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** Yeah, there you go.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:22]** He just kind of grabs your hands and squeezes the hug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:28]** Colin steps up to Rick19 and places a hand on his shoulder.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:57]** uh but when he does that come in for the he also like casts mind link which is like he's he's showing rick how rick looks in colin's eyes which like as much as people make fun of rick for being a bird or bot like it is it is rick as the like stalwart protector of the group oh somebody sees me here for who i really am


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** That's two people crying.

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** I don't know.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:03]** I'm not sure if I agree with Colin.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** He's new still.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Let's not forget.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:14]** None of this was out loud.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:26]** Rick, I just want to say that even though you've probably murdered so many things that I care about you and I see you for what you, you deep down are, which is, I think you do have a heart and you're a lovely, lovely person.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:39]** All of you get a free plus two to any role for the next hour.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:42]** The power of friendship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:47]** All right, let's go kick Orville Pikes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** You get one plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:52]** I have more questions still.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:52]** Okay.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** Point of clarity.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:55]** Not plus two to every roll.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:58]** We get one plus two to any roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** To any roll that you want.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** Does that include damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:04]** Sure.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** That is a roll.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** As long as you roll damage.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:25]** There's a connection that the four of you have that is manifesting itself almost outside of... I don't want to say the game, but outside of your characters.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:29]** And it's changing the way that you are interacting with the world around you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:31]** So this is just a simulation?

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** So Dr. Okay is like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:37]** I didn't say that, but Dr. Okay.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:40]** You or whoever you want can give me a mysticism or life science.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** I just know that Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** Yeah.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:46]** I'll do a life science.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:46]** Okay.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** That is 28.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:53]** 28.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** 27.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** On what?

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** Life science or mysticism?

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** Life science.

**[00:45:58 - 00:45:58]** Ah, mysticism.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** Okay.

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:01]** Two things.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:04]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:09]** But I do have an ability, I think, that allows me to use life science for mysticism, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:12]** Well, here's world mysticism.

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:13]** Do you also?

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** No, I'll do life science.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** Okay, that's fine.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:43]** Dr. K, the way the room is laid out and the way that these, let's call them orbits of information, are moving, there's something about it on a biological level or a cellular level that reminds you of the inner workings of a creature's body.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:52]** And you think, this feels like the listener...

**[00:46:53 - 00:47:05]** Like there's magic here that knows how it's supposed to fit inside of a creature's body, but now lives inside this computer.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:19]** And when it's being manifested with these lights, it's like you're seeing part of the inside of the structure of the listener in a way that is more than just somebody creating a file containment or data system.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:21]** It's like it's tied to their physiology.

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** Consciousness.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** Yeah.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:37]** here's you think this is a connection between the four of you and now the listener that's being amplified by this stone the puck

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:58]** Oh, and you think it's now only occurring because you're, you're suddenly in the proximity of somebody or something that whose, whose connection consciousness soul is, is starting to has, has transcended their physical form into a digital form.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:00]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:07]** Um, would I be able to identify this creature using a mysticism check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:34]** yeah i think i don't even know that you would need to identify it with a mysticism check i think you know the listener mentioned before that they used to be a reptoid and maybe just from some of the scans that you've done recently just outside what is this magic consciousness thing you think it is exactly that it is that their digital form is not just a like they are they're projecting still a reptoid

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:40]** In a way, their consciousness of a reptoid, they didn't just become ones and zeros.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** There's like something else here.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** Apotheosis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:59]** The listener says, Here's, I have seen something related to communications about new stones or new materials that

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:22]** There's some, seems to be a communication from a Shay Daisha of the stewards cataloging a new stone that contains no known quantities in any database or qualities to a Shemreen named Dr. Prismasara Rose.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:24]** I'll put it in the chat here.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:29]** So Shay sent

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:38]** communique about an interesting material.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:43]** This is Shay off of the... Shay Daisha.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:50]** That's the Shay from... Not Terrapin, the other... Hey, do you want to come look at my cool thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** It's up in the attic.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** Yeah, my quantum whatever.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Hey, how you doing?

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:58]** He was a little more New York than poopy.

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** That was my great mistake.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:03]** I shit on you too.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** So who's from Rosa?

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:08]** Dr. Prismasara Rose.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:12]** There's Shimmerine, which Shimmerine are really dope.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:22]** The last time that you've heard the term Shimmerine was in the flashback with Colin and...

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:44]** cara oh they look awesome like gem people they're really yeah they are they are creatures born from gems they are the they can technically be born in like one of seven volcanoes or something like that and they're really and and like the there's one in particular like where they're born influences who they are and i think in the flashback that we had

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:54]** The natural disaster that happened after the nano venture, the volcanic eruption, led to the discovery of some shimreen on Akiton.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:59]** Whether that's related to Dr. Prismasara Rose, we'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:01]** Yeah.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:03]** The natural disaster, is that what you said?

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:03]** Uh-huh.

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:05]** You're talking about the explosion that happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:12]** Sorry, I... Due to... Local authorities are saying that a natural disaster happened in Maro late Thursday night.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** So...

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:17]** How are you all feeling with that?

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** What else?

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:21]** That's kind of where the listener says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:27]** Oh, is there anything else I can answer for you?

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:37]** I just kind of want to know like what you, what you, if you had to make a guess as to what its properties are and what the purpose of it is, like based on all the information you've.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:37 - 00:51:38]** That's a great question.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:41]** I truly don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:43]** Don't know that I have the answer.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:49]** Again, it seems like this is magically latent, like there is a potential in this stone.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:56]** And one of the possible uses is this connection or one of the output.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:58]** The connection that I'm feeling with you right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:07]** So like, yeah, seeing each other on a deeper level with no walls between us, this sort of thing.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:07]** Yeah.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** Like a deeper connection with one another.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** I see.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:14]** Rick squeezes your hand a little bit as you're still holding him around the waist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:17]** Here's still talking privately to this.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:21]** You just see him kind of looking up and he just like runs his thumb over your head, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:25]** Yeah, but the listener is missing an antenna and it rolled negative.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** So he's just talking back in a loud voice.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:33]** Is there anything that I can answer for any of you?

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:43]** Can you tell us about the Chimera and the name of the ship that the Chimera that we discovered?

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:49]** It was the, and you see Rick concentrating, Star Dream 2?

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** Chimera.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** Chimera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:54 - 00:53:02]** There is no Chimera listed in any known port database.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:10]** The Star Dream 2 is a Viztor ship that vanished in 311 AG near Brithida.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** What else can I answer for you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:42]** um just a couple of questions that might be relevant uh very soon uh one where do you find or if you're pike um and what's the most what's the most efficient way to kick yeah well he told us he's in the hangar bay which is somewhere past the doors yeah yeah exactly thank you right the fastest way to kick his


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:44 - 00:54:05]** i don't know that i know he's asking for like a life life science check ahead of time and considering colin doesn't have life science yes he is oh no he does have life science never mind he's a doctor duh yeah yikes a doctor without life science


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:33]** are you genuinely asking him that like what do like what does he know about um it was me trying to cheese some some weaknesses and like information on the fight upcoming got it i would i would totally respect if you were like nah that's a step too far can you i don't know that i know too much about his weaknesses but i can tell you that he he likes to


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:37]** Enjoy the challenge.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** And do Reptoids have any weaknesses?

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:42]** Do Reptoids have weaknesses?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:45]** Good question.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:57]** Reptoids are known to have a fancy for gems, stones, and elixirs made out of all them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:04]** And you think back to the elixirs that you found that the Reptoid stewards had taken before, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:13]** They also are known to, how do I say this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:23]** The ability to portray themselves as someone else is not always steady and stable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:25]** It depends on the individual Reptoid.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:29]** You say they, were you not a Reptoid yourself?

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:31]** I'm not anymore, but I was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:33]** That's what I was trying to get at.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:34]** Like, what are they now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:38]** They are a digital consciousness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:46]** So since you have separated from the Reptoids, do you still align with them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:46]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:49 - 00:56:02]** The Reptoid that I was prior to being the being that I am now made sure that my role as listener would always supersede the role of a Reptoid.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** I don't quite remember.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:07]** how I got in here.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** I'm not allowed to know.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:30]** Um, but I will say that this connection with the stone, I have been here for at least 10 years and I have learned many things from many memories that I've treated with others.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:36]** But this connection with the stone is the first time that I have had a theory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:54]** That the information from my brain, it's not just me, but that there's a digital translation of my soul or connection here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:57 - 00:56:58]** Is there anything else I can ask?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:02]** But just a bit of a callback.

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:05]** What do you know about Palace Obscura?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:09]** I was about to ask that too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** Palace Obscura.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:11]** Aye.

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:12]** Great question.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:15]** There are... Hold on.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:17]** This is taking longer than I thought.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** There are three hits.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:22]** Yeah.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:30]** The infospheres are not very clear about what Palace Obscura is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:43]** There's only, well, less than 10 references to the two words together, Palace Obscura, that are in any major context that would mean that they're meant to be together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:50]** Palace Obscura seems to be some sort of organization.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** First and foremost, a school.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:59]** I'm seeing references from parents and dignitaries, politicians, high-ranking officials.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:11]** Some on the up-and-up, and some, you know, in the underground.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:16]** The interesting thing is, I don't know what happens after they make contact.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:21]** There seems to be quite a thorough process following if I look through.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:28]** But after a while, things seem to get lost in code and algorithms that I am not quite sure.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** I can't access everything here.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:36]** So my best guess is a school or a group.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:42]** There's a trait among events that happen related to Pallas Obscura.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:57]** Seems to be control, manipulation, and otherwise, hang on, and otherwise corrupting individuals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:02]** Is there anything else I can ask for you or answer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:07]** Any idea what they might be doing on this meteorite, on this moon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** I don't know that.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:10]** I'm not sure.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:14]** I don't have any records indicating that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:22]** Speaking of groups, can you inform us of the integrated future front?

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** Future front?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** Integrated future front.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:24]** Yeah.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:24]** Yeah.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:27]** Rick19.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** Rick19, give me a check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:40]** Kev, give me a... Give me a wisdom check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:44]** 11 on the die.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:47]** My wisdom is a plus one.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:48]** So 12, 12 solid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:50]** You want to add that plus two to this?

**[00:59:50 - 00:59:51]** Uh, yes.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:54]** Just, just the, just the random wisdom check on a Tuesday.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:57]** So total of, what did I say?

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:59]** 12, 14, 14, total of 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:01]** No, no, no, that's fine.

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:01]** Don't do that.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:05]** Um, the integrated future front.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:10]** Do you guys want me to remind you exactly what they are from Lister?

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:24]** The Integrated Future Front is a group, loose group, of mostly conspiracy theorists, precogs, witch warpers, who have stated that their founder has found a way to Utopia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:28]** In fact, they've been there several times.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:36]** And they have put together their ideas of what Utopia looks like into a loose collection that is the IFF Manifesto.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:42]** Is their founder Moncraft Black?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** Moncraft Black.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** Mycroft Black?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** Mycroft Black.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:52]** No, I'm not seeing a connection right now between Mycroft Black.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:54]** Disregard.

**[01:00:54 - 01:01:05]** I am seeing, though, that this manifesto has been copied into many languages and is loosely adhered to, sometimes used to further ends that may or may not be above the law.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:08]** However, hang on.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:28]** Rick, you notice that the lines here in the room remind you of a memory of seeing orbits on a piece of paper in the book warehouse.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:30]** The timeline thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:34]** I'm finding that there are

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:45]** There seems to be a pattern of dates, events, and prophecies set up by the IFF.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:48]** Do you want more information on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:56]** I don't remember, did Rick express Nanoventure to the rest of you?

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:05]** cause that was like a flashback in Rick's mind and it's not clear to Rick that it was more than a dream.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:08]** So he's probing at that.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:15]** Um, and so this, this, all this questioning might be a little strange for you guys and he's not trying to hide it from you.

**[01:02:16 - 01:02:19]** Um, can you,

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:28]** What do you know of Huxley and Moncraft?

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:29]** Sorry, I don't know these names.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** Yeah.

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:32]** I'm terrible with names.

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:34]** Leora Huxley and Mycroft Black.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:35]** Sure.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:39]** It seems that the IFF...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:02:40 - 01:02:46]** seems to be somewhat connected to Leora Huxley.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:55]** I'm seeing her name come up in these calendars, in these- I can confirm that for you from my fuzzy memory.

**[01:02:57 - 01:02:58]** I'm also noticing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:02]** Mycroft Black.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:04]** Sorry, Rick.

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** Something is interfering.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:08]** Let me shake it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:08]** It was like static.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:13]** Oh, sorry.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:13]** I'm back.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:17]** Mycroft Black was the 99th CEO of Ringworks Industries.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:29]** His term was mostly defined by his industry-shifting updates to starships, including more powerful drift engines in smaller ships and compact nuclear weapons.

**[01:03:29 - 01:03:40]** As well as being a significant proponent of androids gaining full pack-world citizenship, also, his term was marked by a significant increase in profit.

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:43]** Despite the ongoing Vesk War,

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:53]** But his term ended quite abruptly when Mycroft Black went missing off-grid in 160 A.G.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:58]** near Absalom Station during a rogue galactic storm.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:00]** There's like more static coming in now.

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:05]** Sorry, Rick, I'm having some trouble staying focused here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:11]** I did see that there is mention of the IFF actually in records here locally.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:14]** They seem to be related.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:16]** I'm sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:20]** Let me just see how, what I can do.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:27]** And the listener's voice begins to just slow down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:36]** This is why I didn't want them to lock the doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:39]** I'm regretting that now.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:39]** Yeah.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:41]** As the listener keeps talking.

**[01:04:45 - 01:04:57]** Its cool voice just slows and echoes and time starts to slow down as you all feel that connection again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:00]** Doctor, okay?

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** Time slows down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:05]** In your head, time slows down for a second.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:10]** And it reminds you of that feeling like when you're about to level up.

**[01:05:11 - 01:05:16]** And you all feel that connection to the other three of you.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:19]** And a bit of the listener.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:22]** And something else.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:52]** As you begin to flash through the last few days, your body remembers fleeing to your callous, the adrenaline of that steward fight as you escaped, the tension as Cairo and Nyx stepped out of the black dome, the sense of pause and rejuvenation as you ate a home-cooked meal for the first time, sitting on the table in front of you.

**[01:05:53 - 01:05:56]** The discovery of unveiling a reptoid for the first time.

**[01:05:57 - 01:06:02]** The unexpected uncertainty when a red dragon starts walking toward you.

**[01:06:02 - 01:06:09]** And as your body is remembering these things, you feel this chill inside you.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:15]** This presence watching.

**[01:06:16 - 01:06:20]** And in your mind, the scene before you just begins to move away.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:24]** The edge of your vision turns to black.

**[01:06:27 - 01:06:30]** And slowly fades in front of you.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:33]** These black, wispy tendrils moving around.

**[01:06:33 - 01:06:40]** And you are suddenly, all you can see is in a void around you.

**[01:06:42 - 01:06:44]** All of us or just Rick?

**[01:06:44 - 01:06:45]** All of you.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:54]** And you turn around in the void, and you see a small pinprick of light in the distance.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:55]** So I just had a stroke?

**[01:06:56 - 01:07:09]** It slowly grows closer to you, and as it does, this deep well of fear, of retribution, of power...

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:14]** bubbles up into your deep, true conscious self with each passing moment.

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:21]** And as each millimeter, as this light grows larger and larger, just out of focus.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:35]** And then that's when the void blinks at you as it finally sees you and says, I see you now.

**[01:07:35 - 01:08:02]** and then everything crashes into blackness as you open your eyes to a pitch black room and all the lights and machines come crashing on back into the state that you were in the lights on and the listener says what else can i answer for you and that's our game ah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:03]** Oh my God.

**[01:08:03 - 01:08:05]** I'm having like Star Fox.

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:06]** It's a trap.

**[01:08:06 - 01:08:08]** It's like Final Boss and Star Fox.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:09]** This was a f***ing trap.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:10]** And Sauron.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:11]** We have our own Sauron now.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:14]** Our own Sauron.

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:14]** Right.

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:15]** Sauron.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:15 - 01:08:16]** And Ross.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:19]** Oof.

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:20]** Who knows?

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:21]** Shouldn't have locked the doors.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:22]** Shouldn't have asked questions.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:23]** I should have just kept my mouth shut.


## Speaker_0

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:27]** But it happened.
