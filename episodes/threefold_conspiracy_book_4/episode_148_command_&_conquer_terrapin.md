## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:14]** Hello friends.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:21]** Welcome to my channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:19 - 00:01:25]** That was a clean start for episode 148 of We'll Save the Podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:25 - 00:01:29]** As we swiftly implemented a new rule.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** Thank you, Will.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:32]** Don't f*** with the countdown.

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:34]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:36]** If you want to know how John f***ed that up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:37 - 00:01:38]** Listen to the pre-banter.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:39]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:01:39 - 00:01:40]** Nass has had that rule for a long time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** I'm just saying.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:45]** They should just all use the same version.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:46]** We should just switch to metric.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:46]** That's it.

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** Now, with that said... My old-fashioned's almost gone already.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:51]** What's the metric of seconds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** Metric of seconds.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** My name's John Swan.

**[00:01:54 - 00:02:04]** I'm your hostage-holding GM, joined by my fellow friends here, Vinny, Kelly, Kev, and Will, who are all metrics enthusiasts, right?

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:05]** No.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** We're all just pro-metric.

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:07]** No?

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** Got an anti-metric crowd here?

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:09]** Metrics.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:10]** KPIs.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:12]** Got a metric conspiracist here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** Good reporting system.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:16]** No, I don't have a... I don't believe in metric...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:38]** conspiracies or anything i just i like my miles what was the first unit that you encountered will in your time travel elephants that's six cubits cubits okay yeah sort of pythagorean times i guess or like a like a furlong was it furlong yeah you can use those too


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** That's over land, right?

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** Yeah, it's an eighth of a mile.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Because nautical miles are different, right?

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** Or no, leagues.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** Leagues is the... Leagues.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:47]** Yeah.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:47]** Right, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:50]** A league is a length, not a depth.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]** But can you just rotate your length?

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:55]** They cover this in depth on Live and Let Fly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** Can't you just shout out STF?

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:00]** Fantastic friends of the pod.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:00]** Yeah, STF.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** Live and Let Fly.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** Go listen to it.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:02]** It's a great show.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:05]** But couldn't you rotate a league to be depth?


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:05]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:14]** Yes and no, you could, but the depth of the ocean is like only half a league deep, I think, at the deepest point or something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:16]** Or the other way around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** So was Jules Verne's just like an asshole?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:22]** Okay, but if you're doing depth, are you measuring nautical miles?

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:27]** Because a league can be used for both land and nautical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** 20,000 leagues under the sea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:30]** Right.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:40]** The whole thing with 20,000 leagues on the sea is 20,000 leagues traveled around the world while under the ocean.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** Not 20,000 leagues.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:45]** Literally under, he would be crushed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:50]** I think we should start a petition to change the title.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** 20,000 leagues traveled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:52 - 00:04:16]** under this right yeah it's it'll be like six thousand rolls right off so it's a challenger deep really so easy yeah challenger deep in the marion's trench is approximately 3.4 leagues deep so the deepest point in known demand is only 3.4 leagues or 3.14 leagues pie it's pie leagues that's ironic maybe it goes into infinity we just haven't

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:18]** Or is it coincident?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:23]** I actually found a trench that's 3.5 leagues deep.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** Is that true?

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:26]** Just trying to one-up the Mariana's Trench.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:28]** That's my goal all the time.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:31]** We got a banter topic for this week.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:35]** I'm going to roll and see what it's going to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** What's it going to be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:38]** What's it going to be?

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** What's it going to be?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:42]** Do you guys know how tall Olympus Mons is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:42]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** What is Olympus Mons?

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:44]** That's a great question.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:52]** It's like the Mount Everest on Mars, and it's 26 kilometers high.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** That doesn't seem very high.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:57]** How high is Everest in terms of kilometers or leagues?

**[00:04:59 - 00:04:59]** It's 8.8.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** It's 8.8 leagues?

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** All right.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** No, it's 8.8 kilometers.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:04]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** OK.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** So Mons is huge compared to that.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Yeah.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:14]** Well, now that we're talking about thresholds and things that are, you know, like, where is, we are measuring things.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** Cryodaman wants to know, am I the asshole?

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** A-I-T-A.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:22]** What is the threshold where something is no longer a sandwich?

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:27]** My wife gets very angry when I suggest a hot dog or a sandwich wrap could be a sandwich.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:32]** Meanwhile, I would accept a Pop-Tart as a technically correct submission for a sandwich.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** I've asked coworkers and friends.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:39]** Some are structural purists, while others maintain specific ingredients are necessary.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:51]** CubeRule.com has some reasonable guidelines for defining sandwich hood, but I want to know what does the cast of, we'll say the podcast, no space, say is the threshold of what makes a sandwich.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:54]** I'm going to tell you right now, we are not going to get a consensus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:54 - 00:06:10]** no no no no we we all have very strong opinions in this area and none of them align so yeah i i definitely veto the pop chart though i think we need to align on that one in order for it to be a sandwich it has to have a protein in the middle a protein protein bro bro


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** Have you had a veggie sandwich?

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** Yeah.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:14]** Yeah, what about peanut butter and jelly?

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** That's clearly a sausage sandwich.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** Oh, peanut is a protein.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:18]** Peanut is a protein?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:19]** Yes.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** You can just have a jam sandwich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:24]** Peanut butter is just peanuts.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:26]** Take a peanut and you smash it up.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** It's still a peanut.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:30]** I told my son, if you're chewing peanuts, you're making peanut butter.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:34]** I would just argue that peanut butter is not the most intense form of protein.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** But it is a protein, which is the requirement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:40]** I was trying to think like BLT, but you can have like a veggie sandwich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:42]** What about an ice cream sandwich?

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:45]** You can also have one gram of protein means that anything is protein.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:45]** What did Will say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** I said ice cream sandwich.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:48]** What about an ice cream sandwich?

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** Ice cream sandwich.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** You know what?

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:51]** There's protein in ice cream.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** There's protein in, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:55]** So it tracks.

**[00:06:55 - 00:07:00]** So for Venny, if it has zero grams of protein, it's not a sandwich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:00]** Right.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:03]** So a jam sandwich is not a sandwich then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:03]** No.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:03]** No.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:04]** That's a pastry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** A banana sandwich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** That's a pastry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:07]** Pastry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:09]** What a distinction.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:10]** A pastry is a subset of a sandwich.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:11]** Technically bananas have protein.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:12]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** No, they don't.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:16]** Yes, they do, bro.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** A lot of things have protein.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:19]** Zero to one gram of protein is no protein.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:22]** I think you didn't say protein.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** You didn't say a quantified amount of protein.

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:24]** You did say protein.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:26]** The food has to be considered a protein.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** Bananas are not considered a protein.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** What are the other staples?

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:35]** Because the Pop-Tart is completely surrounded in a single piece of... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:35 - 00:08:03]** the car yeah i mean a snack wrap i could i would call that a sandwich it's it's a wrap about a cucumber sandwich though yeah is that a pastry vinnie also like it's not a sandwich yes this is like that's it by this working definition like a burrito sandwich or candy yeah if it has seen it i think it is though i think it is i think it's technically a sandwich it's it's a sandwich in the same way tomato is a fruit


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:09]** And to be clear, crowd image did ask, what is the threshold at which something is no longer a sandwich?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:12]** So like a quesadilla is definitely a sandwich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:14]** First of all, a Pop-Tart is a calzone.

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:15]** A burrito is questionable.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** I just want that to be entered into the record.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:20]** Yes, a Pop-Tart is a calzone.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** That's true.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** A Pop-Tart is a breakfast calzone.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:25]** A calzone is a sandwich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:28]** I'm going to enter in a possible new parameter that we need to consider.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:34]** Is there any air between the two slices, let's say, right?

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:37]** Because then a burrito wouldn't be a sandwich.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** No, a burrito's not a sandwich.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:42]** Why is air a piece of the... Because the area is wrapped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** A burrito is sushi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:43]** Right.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** A burrito is sushi because there's no air.

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:50]** The entire circumference is wrapped.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:50]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** How do you make your burritos?

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** My burritos, I trap air in my burritos.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** No, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:58]** It's not about trapping airs, but in a sandwich, there's air between the two slices.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:01]** If you were to put a skewer through a burrito.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:04]** would it hit air or would it hit any bread?

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:05]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:20]** Well, like the, I think what John's trying to say is if there's more than one starch holding the, the, the thing together, I think it's more than if the coverage area is homogenous, let's say in terms of like, it is completely covered continuous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:22]** That's, that's a, that's a better term, right?

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:23]** Then it's not a sandwich.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:24]** It's what you say.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:27]** Uh, then that is not a sandwich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:30]** So a pita's not a sandwich then in that case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** No, it would be.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** A pita will taste well.

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:33]** Because it's not continuous, it's open.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** A pita and a quesadilla, right?

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:36]** Because there's air at the top.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Are you stuffing the pita?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:40]** Then it's a soup or a salad with a bread bowl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:41]** So a calzone is not a sandwich then.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:42]** I see.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** Oh my God.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** Our bread bowl sandwiches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:47]** I like this, Will.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:48]** I think that's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:51]** He put up the cube rule of food.

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:55]** Number one is toast, and it shows it's just a cube, right?

**[00:09:55 - 00:10:01]** So if you take an invisible cube, toast is the bottom side, one-sided.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:03]** A sandwich would be the top and the bottom.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** So it's two separate pieces.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:11]** A taco is three sides all adjacent.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** So one, two, and three touching.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:17]** Sushi would be all four with a hole through the middle.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** Soup or salad or a bread bowl.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:23]** is a quiche.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:25]** Yeah.

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:27]** I agree with Will's thinking here.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** And a calzone is all sides.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** And that makes sense.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:33]** Because then you just end up with the only thing being a sandwich, a f***ing sandwich.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:37]** Which is like what it actually, because then that would mean that like, yeah, like.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:42]** No, because a quiche, depending on how you make your quiche, a hot dog's not a sandwich then, which is like people are typically like, oh yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:46]** If you fold your quiche, then it becomes like a taco, right?

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:46]** I think,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** Yeah, so basically sandwiches are sandwiches.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** Sanity is restored.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:56]** But if you put two separate pieces of tortilla, if you have one tortilla, cheese, and another tortilla, that's a sandwich.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** But no one does that.

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** So it's like, I want to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** I do that.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** No, no, no.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** That's a type of taco that you can get.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** You're like a psycho.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** Is that a mulita?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:06]** You eat that before going to bed at 4.30 p.m.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** You're a psycho, okay?

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:08]** This is how you are.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:08]** What?

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** You wake up early and do the same thing.

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:12]** He sleeps at 4.30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:17]** Yeah, so that's technically a mulita, or a mulita, Benny, but it's a tortilla sandwich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** Okay.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:20]** I don't know.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:20]** Like a torta?

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Desert Hispanics.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:24]** I don't know enough about that.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** Wrong Hispanics.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:26]** I don't know how you spell this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:35]** Because I tried to look up Molita and I got a Galatian term for a cushion or padding specifically used as part of a head yoke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** So it depends pretty much.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Are you a cubist?

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:39]** Right.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:40]** Or are you a continuist?

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:41]** Right.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:47]** Are you saying that you go by the rule of cube or do you go by the rule that things must be continuous?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:56]** I'm really... Before we had this conversation and before I saw this image, I was willing to debate, but now that I've seen this cube rule, I totally agree with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** Cube rule.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** Is a pig in a blanket a sandwich?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:03]** Pig in a blanket would be sushi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:05]** Actually...

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:07]** You're saying because the air's on the other end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:08]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** No, I don't think it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:11]** Picking a blanket is a sushi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** Yeah, I'd agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** It's a sushi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:16]** Even as a continuous myself, I don't think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** And a dumpling is a burrito?

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** A calzone.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** It's a calzone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:27]** If it's completely sealed, it's considered a calzone.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** Or would a calzone be considered a dumpling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:34]** I don't think a dumpling might be the proper... It kind of is even pinched like a dumpling sometimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:45]** To Kelly's point, the cultural lens that you're looking at it with could dictate the larger, let's say, containers that you're talking about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:47]** And in that case, a Pop-Tart would be a calzone.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:49]** Or a pierogi.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:50]** But there's no protein.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** It's a pastry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** So what?

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:55]** And we've come full circle.

**[00:12:55 - 00:13:01]** So you're saying you're arguing for whether or not a sandwich is based on content?

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:07]** Totally neglecting cucumber finger sandwiches for our British friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:10]** So we have two Cubists at least, Kev and Will.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** I am a Continuous.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** Kelly is, I think, a Cubist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:15]** I traditionally think a sandwich is a sandwich.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** I think you're all crazy.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** I'm somewhere on an island in the Caribbean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:20]** Yeah, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** Eating your protein-only sandwich.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:25]** This goes to, like, Play-Doh and, like, what is a chair?

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** It does.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:26]** It does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:30]** Thank you, Cardamon, for this fantastic...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:31]** Oh, man.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:41]** I found an even more... I found a more developed table of the cube rule, and it showed three layers on the cube is a cake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** Mmm.

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** A king's cake, I just said.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Yeah.

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:50]** So club sandwiches are cake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** So club sandwiches are cake.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Yes.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** Yeah.

**[00:13:54 - 00:13:55]** I'm not mad at that.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:58]** I'm not mad at that.

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:58]** Yeah.

**[00:13:59 - 00:13:59]** I like that.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:01]** Shameless plug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** And rest in peace, the chicken Big Mac.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** Dude, the chicken Mac was killer.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:11]** And I only heard about it through you, Vinny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:14]** Also, ramen is nachos, apparently.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** Ramen is nachos.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:16]** Interesting.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** Ramen is nachos?

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** Why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:19]** Okay.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:21]** Is pho nachos?

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** I think there's a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:51]** yeah would nachos be considered like a pasta then no perhaps nachos are nachos i think you should ask your friends and family what they think dear listener i think you should give them the option and see what they say bring this up during thanksgiving dinner yeah let the debate reign supreme uh and while you're at it tell them that you listened on uh that that you heard the question on we'll save the podcast um let let you should let your mother-in-law know let your friend know

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:54]** But anybody who likes sci-fi or maybe is like, what is sci-fi?

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:57]** Be like, well, here's a good introduction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:06]** Kelly, you should do is like, yeah, you should like lock your family in your car on like a long road trip and just force them to listen until they can tolerate this show.

**[00:15:07 - 00:15:09]** And then, yeah, that's what we need.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** No shame.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** I did that to my coworker.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:13]** We were stuck in a car for a while.

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:15]** And I was like, have you heard about podcast?

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:16]** Play button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:17]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** She liked it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** Yeah.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:22]** Vinny, what is a turducken?

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** It's an abomination.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:27]** It's an abomination.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** There's no starches.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:35]** It's a huge abomination with at least 150 HP that you have to take out every Thanksgiving.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:37]** You have to fight every Thanksgiving.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:39]** It's a CR12.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:39]** It's a CR12.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:39]** CR20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:43]** If you're doing it right.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:47]** Kelly, do you have any shoutouts that you want to give to anybody on Discord?

## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:53 - 00:17:00]** Since you brought it up, I'm actually going to make a request of Glenn Bob if you listen to this episode or anyone else who might be listening, the cast included.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:03]** I'm going to be in Vegas for the first time in like three weeks.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:07]** So looking for food activity wrecks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** Yeah, I have some.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** I'm sure Will has some too.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** Food wrecks?

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:12]** Yeah, food wrecks.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** For Vegas?

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:13]** Also things to do.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:15]** You know about Vegas food?

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:19]** My vote, not necessarily food related, Meow Wolf.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** I think we've talked about it before.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** Secret pizza is good.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:24]** Food, secret pizza is great.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:33]** But yes, if you do know, dear listener, and let me know, even if three weeks after the release date of this episode has passed, you should still let us know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** Are you going to play any tables?

**[00:17:34 - 00:18:02]** uh probably blackjack uh blackjack probably some poker nice nice i enjoy holding well do a tournament speaking of like sit and go tournaments that are pretty fun that's cool speaking of going i'm sorry holden let's play let's play because uh orvi was holding but we'll get there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:32]** thing is lots of questions were revealed as we are getting close to episode 150 we're at episode 148. yeah some questions are actually answered some questions were answered finally finally do you feel vindicated no okay well lots of questions and some answers were revealed in the last three episodes things are starting to come to a head at terrapin have all the secrets been revealed at terrapin

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:40]** i don't know are there any questions that particularly stuck out for y'all i can walk through some big ones that i


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:42 - 00:19:08]** like that y'all asked that we talked about but were there any that that stuck out for y'all that come to mind the questions yeah the questions or the answers like like the things that you discovered from the listener is there anything that stuck out no i'm not really surprised about the uh yeah i was just gonna say that the fact that roly is being continuing to be enigmatic in in life or death or whatever this is very vague answers about roly which makes sense which makes

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:10]** Because John's tricky with him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:12]** No death certificate.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** That was an interesting one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:13]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:16]** No death certificate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:23]** I think the whole questioning of IFF and then that led to whatever happened where we heard the voice saying, I see you.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:27]** That's more questions than answers for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** Yeah, were those related?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** Can we talk?

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:31]** I mean... Were those related?

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** I don't know.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:33]** You tell me, John.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** Kelly?


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:44]** I was going to say, should we talk about... There's now a new theory on the Discord, which makes sense to me that... So, I don't know.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:46]** Maybe we should cut this if it's too revealing.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:48]** If it is true, I don't know.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** Spoiler alert.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** Spoiler alert.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** Spoiler alert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:53]** Spoiler alert.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:54]** Spoiler alert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:54 - 00:20:00]** All of our characters are sandwiches because they're just, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** That's a great theory.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:02]** That's a great theory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:06]** All of our characters might be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** That's the spoiler sound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** Yeah.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:12]** might be like a fever dreams or whatever.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** No, we talked about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:23]** How pissed we would all be if we did six full books to turn out to be just like a dream or whatever the case is.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:23]** Oh my God.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:24]** No, f*** that.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:27]** John, if that's, you rewrite the f***ing ending.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** Oh dude.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:28]** Yeah, that's crazy.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** Is this for a dream?


## Speaker_0

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:41]** Yeah, because then that would mean that our least played characters are actual like living characters, which is f***ing frightening because I don't have enough content for Boom.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:42]** I don't know how to live as him forever.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:45]** It's like horrible.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:46]** So I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:49]** I mean, look, I don't know what's going to happen in the end.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:52]** I'm just letting the story go through me.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:56]** But that would be crazy if you were dreams.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:57]** Yeah.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:00]** If this was all a dream and you woke up, that would be a little bit crazy.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** Like bad crazy.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** Yeah, it would.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Like quit crazy.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:03]** Don't do that.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** Yeah.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:05]** Like quit?

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** Like we all rage quit?

**[00:21:06 - 00:21:07]** It's not up to me.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:09]** You'd probably hold that off until the end, I guess.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:11]** Yeah, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:12]** It's not up to you.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** You can change it.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:16]** Do you guys remember when we finished Threefold and found out we were dreaming the whole time?

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** That was crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** That'd be crazy.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** I would not do that.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:25]** But seven years of our IRL life by that point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** One year per fold.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** Oh my god.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:31]** But good thoughts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:36]** Sorry, I do want to point out for Rick at least, you guys all played the Nen Adventure.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:38]** You guys were all involved in that

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:41]** But that was just a vision that Rick had.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** It was just a thought.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:45]** It was a flash in front of his eyes type thing.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:49]** And he hasn't expressed this to the other characters yet.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:50]** But you as players know this.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:57]** And what the listener did for him was confirm that it wasn't just a vision or a dream.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:02]** There were details from NanoVenture that the listener confirmed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:05]** Ah, another fold to the conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** Another fold.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** Not the right incentive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:09]** Was it?

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:09]** They did that again?

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** That was cryo gaming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:10]** That was talking.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** That was Kyle.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:13]** Oh, no, no, that was Kyle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:14]** I'm sorry.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:15]** It's the gift that keeps on giving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:16]** It really does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:19]** Or sandwich monk, as people, some hear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** No, no, no.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:22]** Another photo to the conspiracy was cryo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** It was cryo gaming.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** Cryo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:25]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:28]** You know, Calzone Damon, as he might be called.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:31]** Taco Cow Monk, you have brought many things as well.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** I think he's still talking about Taco Cow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** I'm going to show you how to turn $50 into $300.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:37]** It's called Double D. Even though there's a cube rule.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:43]** Step one, what we're going to do is we're going to put $50 on any one-to-one bet on the outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:45]** Who is watching?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:47]** Did you hear that?


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:48]** Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:57]** I was trying to send a strategy video on betting and roulette to Vinny on the side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:01]** Bet on the sandwich.

**[00:23:01 - 00:23:02]** Good questions, though.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:04]** A couple other ones that I want to highlight.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:09]** Why were the Reptoids investigating security around this Carnival of the Winds?

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:11]** What was that?

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:19]** Why was Dr. Buzdakis, Dr. O'Keefe, on Rosalita being interviewed by the stewards with that one doctor?

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:31]** That's your first kind of definitive proof of Dr. B's whereabouts since you've been asking in episode one that he had been someplace.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:40]** What's the amplification of this connection between the four of you and the listener from the puck?

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:47]** What is this group of Reptoids obsession, not just with the IFF, but with Old Galarian?

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:57]** Does it have to do with their check-ins at the mine, now known as Corundum, but when it was run by Ringworks?

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:01]** Remember you found logs saying that the stewards had checked in.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:09]** What is this weather pattern that's out in the vast near Outpost Omicron?

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:20]** why did Shay message the shimmering researcher, Dr. Prismasar Rose, at the Fairwinds Corporation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:25]** That one's straightforward, because Shay's a fucking reptoid, and he was sending- The puck's a sandwich.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:29]** Yeah, he was like, hey, we found this new sandwich here.

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:30]** Yes.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:32]** No, I think by sandwich standards, the puck would be charcuterie.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:33]** Oh.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** Because it's just protein.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** Because it's just protein.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** It's just protein and salad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** I'm with Will on this one.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** I think it's salad.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:48]** Also, why were the Reptoids amassing this footage about the four of you and doctoring it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:49 - 00:25:06]** slanting it towards the bias of you all portraying you all as aggressors so they could turn the stew the real stewards against us so they could take over the stewards propaganda 101 because it's all a dream and they're just trying to trying to build into the fever dream yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:19]** Well, this is all going... I think the other revelation was that the Star Dreamer, Starliner 2 exists and disappeared, but there's no record of the Chimera.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** There's no record of the Chimera.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:23]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:36]** So this is all maybe going through your characters' minds in the back of your minds as you all are snapped back to reality that this room of answers, the cradle of listening...

**[00:25:36 - 00:26:05]** is still inside an unsafe secret reptoid outpost and the threats are in the hangar bay now you start your exploration first discovering the power center of terrapin and discovering that it's it's drawing much more power to something in the hangar bay than you would think is needed it's odd


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:07]** I have a, I have a fun back of the napkin theory.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:12]** And I think the dragon egg is somehow connected to the power center in that room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** Or maybe it's just communications for the listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:15]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:17]** What if the dragon egg is the power core?

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:19]** That's yeah.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:20]** Yeah.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:23]** The files are anyway.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:26]** That's why I asked where the egg was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** There's no, uh, there's no evidence for that.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** That's just my gut.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** That's just the gut.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:34]** There's enough evidence there called a conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** What's the threshold for a conspiracy?

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** Let's talk about that as our next banter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** Almost no supportive evidence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:45]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:48]** It's a heavy one.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:48]** No, shut it down.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:50]** Shut it down.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:50]** I can't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** Yeah, thank you.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** Thank you, Will.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** That was perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** I'm going to believe the whole thing.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:56]** What is the threshold?

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** That's it.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:24]** And that's after you guys go in there is set a double doors and you just I think you all had an an Uneasy unnerving confirmation feeling right that like looking at that doors that I mean besides the fact that I think it said hangar you're like this is this this is where something is about to go down and I'll bring you guys back to the map here on foundry in just a second and

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:30]** Because as you went in, if you recall, you saw many faces waiting for you.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:36]** There was a snarling Wetzelt to the south.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:43]** There is the stoic face off to the left of Officer Astara.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:55]** There was the smiling face of Orvier Pike, who is holding a gun.

**[00:27:56 - 00:28:03]** to the head of the last face, the terrified Keniko Breeze.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:05]** And before we pick it up there, Kev has a question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:14]** No, I just want to clarify that because, like, the last time, I don't know why, but the way you described it, I heard that, like, he basically had Kaneko bounded, bound?

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:15]** Binded?

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:16]** Bound.

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:17]** Bound.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:21]** And then, like, was using her as a mount for this large railgun.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:25]** But you are saying that he's actually just holding the railgun to her.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:29]** He's just a boss, and he just has this gun, like, resting on her shoulder.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** So it's resting on her shoulder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:35]** Aimed at her head.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:35]** Oh, wow.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:38]** See, that's where you got... I thought it was resting on her shoulder, pointing at us.

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:41]** It's a railgun.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:44]** But railguns in the Starfinder world are not like other railguns.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:47]** Railguns in general are just kinetic.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:47]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** I've just given up.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:51]** Are you talking about Los Alamos railguns?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:54]** The Los Alamos railguns?

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:54]** Yeah.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:58]** Well, that is where we will pick it up.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:03]** As I will say, that as you walked in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** Oh boy, look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:10]** You can see that Kaniko Breeze struggling against Orvier.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** He's a big bad mother.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** He's in that armor.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:18]** He has this just intense look.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** I think I'm going to show you guys actually.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** Let me show you two things.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:27]** The artwork first of when you first met him.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** Smiling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** Still looking kind of mean.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:34]** It's got scars on his face.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Yeah.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** He's seen some shit, but he's jovial.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** I should have kept his fucking armor.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:47]** But he has this intense bat shit armor that like also comes around his head and his chin and his bald head and this like cool mark on his face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** It looks better on Rick.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** That's all I'm saying.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:52]** It looks like the face of a psycho from Borderlands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** I also miss him.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:54]** A bit.

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:55]** A bit.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:55]** Yeah.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** Yeah.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** He does look like that.

**[00:29:57 - 00:29:58]** He does.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:59]** He does.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:04]** Let me now show you the artwork that I have for him.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:33]** now it changes it's just a reptoid in the same armor ah no there it is i mean it's the same but the armor that's the armor yeah but his armor is like he's like gundam yeah you know this is huge yeah yeah he's a big cool on rick oh well you can resize it and that gun i mean it's cut off a bit but you can see how like how long that rifle is


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:51]** yeah with this orange core in the center his face is serious he could definitely be on real safe looks like an ar-10 platform looks pretty sweet i don't know yeah i mean probably he is probably bigger than 308 maybe he is 30-06 an assault rail gun


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:58]** after book three and plot armor, I will show you the, uh, the cover and the cover has him on it.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:00]** It just, and like, yeah, thanks.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:00]** Yeah.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:03]** Because you've read the book as you should.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:07]** Um, but he is just like super menacing and just taking up the whole cover.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:08]** It's bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:14]** Do we, do we have, do we have an updated picture for the Vlaka of Astara officer Astara?

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:15]** Yeah, that's her name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Uh, I'm always down for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:17]** Nope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:19]** I don't think so.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:20]** But I did change, uh,

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:22]** token around it, you can see.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:25]** Anyway, so back to the moment and the tension.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:34]** There was another one hand of Orvir's was pointed at Kaniko's head as she is struggling.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:37]** She's feisty, but she's scared.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:42]** The other hand, there's just a giant talon coming out of one finger.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:46]** As you can see, part of that fingertip is like starting to be green.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** And he has it on her throat.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** And there's just a little bit

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:55]** You're like, is that blood?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:58]** So he's got a gun pointed at her and a finger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** But the gun is a two-headed weapon.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** He's resting it on her shoulder.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** Is he Vulcan?

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** He's resting it on her shoulder, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:11]** Your little ass will die, Colin.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:18]** Unless the four of you step in and drop your weapons and surrender.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:22]** I think you know what the right choice is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:32]** He just shouts and the echo of the hangar captures his very serious voice.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:34]** I've unpaused the game.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:37]** What do you all do?

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:38]** What do you say?

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:39]** Are we in initiative order?

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:40]** Nope.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** It's a tense moment, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:42]** What are you going to do?

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:48]** Rick, being there out front, is going to step forward.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:58]** He's got his gun up, but as he steps forward, he's going to drop his weapon behind him and strap it back to his back.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** And now he's got no hands out.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** Hands up.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:03]** Okay.

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:04]** Yeah.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:05]** And he's going to step in.

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** Man, I don't

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:13]** Colin.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:13]** Colin's good.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:19]** So just Colin, Dr. K, Hears, and Bernice and Effect are still in the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** Rick is the only one that stepped in.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:26]** Colin is following behind Rick and comes to stand next to him, says to Orvier.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** Oi!

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:32]** You kill the last, you'll be joining her post haste.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Is that a threat?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** It's a promise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** It's obviously a threat.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** It sounds more like a warning to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** Just do what he says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** Kaniko says.

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:47]** Rick and Colin are standing next to each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:56]** Dr. Okay is going to walk in and sort of button hook at the frame of the door.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:56]** Okay.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** Go in a little bit.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Okay.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:02]** He's not dropped anything yet.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:05]** And Bernice, he's going to tell Bernice to cover the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:06]** Okay.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** Here's is still standing back behind the door.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:13]** Here's can see officer.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** So Dr. Okay.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:19]** Rick and Colin, give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:24]** Ooh, it's a four on the die for a total of 15, I think.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** 15 from Rick.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:26]** Nope, take that back.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** Sorry, sorry.

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** 13.

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:28]** 13 from Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:32]** 19 on the die plus 13 for... 32.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** 32.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** Colin.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:40]** I'm going to roll my really fancy technical-looking dice that I got from Dispel at JetCon.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:41]** Dispel dice!

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** Ooh.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:44]** Dispel dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:44]** Dispel dice.

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:46]** Dispel dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:49]** I have some 20s from them I'm going to break down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:49]** You want to roll?

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:50]** Perception.

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:52]** Perception.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:54]** That's just the wisdom modifier, right?

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:55]** Oh, no.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** I have a modifier to that.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** It's a skill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** It's a skill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** 30, 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** 30, 20, 30, 20.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** Dr.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:03]** O.K., Rick and Colin, you are focused.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:04]** Dr.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** O.K., we'll get to you in just a sec.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:07]** Rick and Colin, do you say anything else?

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** Dr.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** O.K., do you say anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:11]** Rick is going to step forward just a couple more times.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Before you do.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** Before you do.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** Go back five feet.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:17]** Okay.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:18]** Dr.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:23]** O.K., he's got his hands up and he just says, like, it doesn't have to be this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:27]** Only if you'll get Colin and Doctor okay.

**[00:35:28 - 00:35:36]** And here's if you put down your weapons like Rick did and get on this ship, then I won't have to do it forcefully.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:37]** Maybe you'll live.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Maybe you won't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:48]** You notice off to your right that you and Rick are standing right in front.

**[00:35:48 - 00:36:04]** And maybe you just, you like just saw it, this grazing light, as you realize that there is some sort of laser sensor that is moving diagonally across

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** The room.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:09]** I wish I could show it to just you, Dr. Okay.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:12]** But I'm just going to go ahead and show it in general for everybody here.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:19]** It's running through you and Rick, but my thought is that you guys are right in front of it.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** You have not walked through it yet.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:22]** And you think that this is some sort of trap.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:29]** I'm going to just leave that information with what you want to do with it, Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:32]** Not walking into this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:35]** Rick is about to step forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** There's a laser.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:43]** Hey, what's the meaning of this, Orvir?

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:48]** Seems like you're not really holding up...

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** You're under the bargain on this deal with this.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:53]** Oh, I don't think you're holding up your end of the bargain.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:53]** Trap here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:58]** That's just something that we have to protect what we want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:03]** Well, you wanted us to step forward, but I'm not going to set this off.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:03]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:07]** Are you going to put down your weapons or not?

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:11]** If you do, I'll turn off the trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:12]** Kiers.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:18]** Can Kiers surmise how much health Kineko has at the moment?

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:19]** How is she looking?

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:20]** And what would I roll for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:22]** You would probably do a medicine check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** Yeah, I don't have that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** That's why I was asking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:27]** Is there anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** I was curious to do something similar.

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:32]** Do I believe that Orvir could kill her in one fell swoop?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:33]** Or is she already dead?

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:35]** Based on what I can see.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** And it's a reptoid.

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** Like a zombie?

**[00:37:38 - 00:37:39]** I'll roll a medicine check.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** There's zombies as well.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:41]** It's great.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Would that be a medicine check?

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:44]** How do we know she's not a reptoid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:44]** Nope.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** I got 11.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:48]** Yeah, it could just be another.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:48]** Okay.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:55]** That's a 26 on Collins medicine check.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:55]** Shh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:59]** And you're asking if he could kill her or what her health is?

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** I'm asking... From standing 25 feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:13]** If I think Orvier could reasonably kill her using the talon and the railgun, would she be instantly dead or would we have an opportunity to rescue and stabilize her?

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** Based on his professional medical opinion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:18]** She's not helpless, so he can't tactically coup de grace her.

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:23]** But could he... I mean... He could put a hurtin' on her.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** He could put a hurtin' on her and probably take her down real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Okay.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:31]** Are there any subtle signs that she's not who she says she is?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:32]** Do you want to do a perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:37]** Go ahead and give me a perception check.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:38]** 17 for a 30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:41]** 17 for a 30.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:46]** You are watching her.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** And Dr.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** O.K., you think you see...

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:58]** You think you see some sort of unusual shifting in her body.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:03]** Maybe she's not as scared as she says that she is.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Maybe this is a bit of a front.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:12]** How do we know Kaniko's not one of you Reptoids?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:17]** Why the f*** would you say that when I'm... Shut up!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** Whatever your shake, sir.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:24]** and just pushes the gun against the side of her head.

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:27]** So that movement could have been two things.

**[00:39:28 - 00:39:32]** She's a reptile pretending to be Kaniko, and it's going to spring an attack.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:40]** Or it is Kaniko, and she's feigning weakness in order to help counterattack.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** I'm going to medicate a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** What are you doing?

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:47]** So, Doctor, I have an idea.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:47]** Yeah.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** But, Kelly, you want to go?

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:50]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:55]** Well, I was just going to say what he wanted to do.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:58]** He wanted to help Rick out with his weapon.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:01]** Wait, Rick, what weapon does Rick have out right now?

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:02]** Is it a gun?

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:02]** Nothing.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:03]** What can he see?

**[00:40:03 - 00:40:04]** He put them down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:04 - 00:40:06]** No, you didn't put me down.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:06]** All right.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:07]** There's nothing in his hand.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:09]** There's nothing in his hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:13]** What does Rick... Rick, you usually attack with a gun, though, right?

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** Not like a... I usually shoot with a gun.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:17]** Uh-huh.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** All right.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:21]** I also have... All right, technical Tim.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:25]** All right, so, like... You're going to supercharge his weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** Yeah, I want to supercharge his weapon.

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** You can cast supercharge weapon if you want.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:32]** Rick here getting all pedantic about me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** I don't know where you're going with it.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Give him an edge, maybe.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:37]** So Dr. O.K.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:40]** is going to... He has a few weapons on him.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** Okay.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:46]** And the unequipped weapons, he's going to just start tossing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:49]** So what do you throw out?

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:53]** I'm going to throw out the Murmur Sonic Suppressor.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:54]** Okay.

**[00:40:54 - 00:40:56]** And he says, like, all right, final play ball.

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:57]** Good.

**[00:40:58 - 00:41:01]** And he throws out like a syringe stick.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** Okay.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:06]** And then he reaches for a sticky bomb grenade.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:10]** And I would like to throw that.

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:13]** You would like to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:15]** Are you trying to do it sneakily?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:16]** Yes.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** So I'm guessing a sleight of hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:24]** I think you would absolutely slide a hand, and I think we need to roll for initiative.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:25]** Nice.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:29]** Once you do that, there is no going back from this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:29]** Wait, Lauren.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Here, roll this for me.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** One second.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:33]** What am I rolling first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:42]** I think you should roll initiative, and if they notice what's going on, then they're going to act in the surprise round with you, with you throwing that.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:44]** That's what we're going to do.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:50]** So with that, good way to start it off.

**[00:41:51 - 00:42:15]** 19 plus what's my initiative me start an encounter 21 boom go ahead and add yourselves to the list one second here you should be able to go ahead and add your uh if you click on the swords you can add in i'm clicking what's going on here oh because i have i let lauren roll my die and she rolled an eight thanks lauren

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:17]** Nailed it.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:18]** That's exactly what I wanted you to do.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:21]** I did not say thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:23]** Glad that we talked about that beforehand.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:25]** And that's what you decided to do.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** Why is Kaniko glowing now?

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:28]** She's angry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:30]** Because I'm clicking on her right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** Roll high.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:32]** Buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:33 - 00:42:41]** So what I was gonna metagame was like, I don't wanna burn another second level spell slot, but also like I could just cast Unmask on her.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** We could find out for sure if she's a Reptoid or not.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:46]** What's the distance on that?

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:49]** 25 plus five feet for each level, I think.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:53]** Plus five feet for every two levels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** I mean like, would Colin do that is the question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:59]** Colin, you got a 30 as your initiative?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:00]** No, I got a 19.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:03]** Oh, that's so weird.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** I've got 30 hit points.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:07 - 00:43:07]** I like it.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:10]** Orvear freaking roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:13]** Orvear has a bad initiative value.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:16]** Ooh, the Wetzel did not do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:19]** I'm also worried that armor is like 18 KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:22]** I feel like there was no other way to look at this.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:24]** I'm sorry if I jumped a gun.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:27]** Maybe I can apologize for it and be like, ooh, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:27]** Who knows?

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:29]** So, Dr.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:32]** O.K., what is your sleight of hand roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:38]** That's an 11 plus sleight of hand, 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:38 - 00:43:40]** 25.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** Wow, that's an insane sleight of hand.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:44]** 11, or no, 14, sorry.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:47]** I am rolling this skull dice that I got in Maine.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** Pretty sweet.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** Sorry, so it's a 25.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** 25, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** My sleight of hand is plus 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** Plus 14.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:58]** Pretty frigging sweet here.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:04]** They definitely are not going to figure that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Okay.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** Would they figure this out?

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Give me one second.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** I'm looking something up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** I'm afraid of this trap.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:19]** I don't want to do anything until we figure out the trap.

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:23]** That's why... I mean, like...

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** Because the trap itself could kill all of us.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:29]** Yeah, that's why we don't spring it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:32]** Just retreat back into the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:34]** Just retreat back into the hallway.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:42]** So metagame-wise, what I was working on doing was getting close enough that I could draw my apprehension staff.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:47]** And that way I would be within 10 feet of him and could stop him from shooting.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:49]** Because if you were to shoot, I'd get a reaction.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:51]** Okay.

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:54]** John's excited about something we don't know.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:54]** I am excited.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** Thank you, Skaldi.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:56]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:57]** Impact that for me.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** It's a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Let's revisit that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** It's a great question.

**[00:45:01 - 00:45:01]** Circle right back to that.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:10]** The only person who noticed Dr. Okay is going to be Kanika Bruce.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:13]** Let's start combat.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:38]** and uh it's a surprise round but we'll we'll just look right here dr k you get to go first you have a higher initiative than keniko breeze so you are in a surprise round you have a a standard or a move action that you can do what are you doing to kick off this combat lighten the match i'm i'm throwing the sticky bomb grenade um he's throwing the sticky bomb okay

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** Give me the area that you're throwing it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:46]** Right in between Koneko and Orvier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:48 - 00:46:10]** that little point i think you pick a point right yeah yeah you pick an intersection of a square a corner yeah yeah would that technically have a a little bit of cover it it would increase the ac by i think two for partial cover because there's somebody in your way if you're trying to get something right but what's the radius from five to seven right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:31]** right exactly so don't don't get under seven the range is 20 feet and this is 30 feet okay so that would make the ac it's like plus five for every range increment additional 10 feet right yep or is it plus two plus two i think it's plus two so that's plus so it's so it's nine plus nine

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:33]** Okay, so I got to roll above a nine.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:35]** You got to roll above a nine here.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:38]** To try and... Yes.

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:39]** All right.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:41]** That's an 11 on the die.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** Okay.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** Nice.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** Nice.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** Send it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** Let's do the math.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:47]** Does that beat 9?

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** Send it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:55]** I mean, this is a pretty weak grenade, though, because it's a sticky bomb grenade 1.

**[00:46:55 - 00:47:07]** It entangles for 2d4 rounds if they don't beat... I think the DC Explode is DC 12 and entangle...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:37]** is what it's an acrobatics dc 13. cool well so you throw it let's start there you throw it is this a is this a sky hook or is this a bowling like this is this is the floater pitch in rookie of the year and it's a 10 foot radius right uh radius 10 feet that's what i was saying

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:38]** I don't see it listed here.

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:41]** Sticky bomb grenade.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:44]** Special explode 20 feet.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** So maybe it's a 20 foot radius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** Yeah, I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** No, it's a 10-foot.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** It's a Mark I, right?

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** Yeah.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:54]** So it's a 10-foot radius, so it's a 20-foot centered on that square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:58]** Break DC is 18, actually, whatever that means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** Break DC is probably your entangle.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:01]** Right.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** So let's walk through this.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:15]** So you've thrown it, and it goes off, and the two of them, it lands right in between Kaniko and Orvier, and the two of them have a chance to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:26]** yeah i think it does damage too though no uh i don't think so i think the entangle is the damage that's the yeah because it's a sticky it's 2d foreground


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:32]** And then what is the, yeah, what's the DC and the checks that I have to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Okay.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:38]** Entangle, hit by an entangle becomes entangled until it escapes with an acrobatics check.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:46]** DC 10 plus weapon item level plus the attack or his dexterity or strength.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** I think in my case it's Dex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** Probably Dex.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:50]** So what's your Dex bonus plus the level, which is one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:52]** I think it's a DC 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:54]** DC 13.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:58]** So on their turn, they'll get a DC 13 to break out.

**[00:48:58 - 00:49:00]** So right now they're pretty much entangled in this surprise round, we'll say.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:02]** Dang, they are entangled.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** That is freaking cool.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:08]** I'm going to add this condition on here right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:10]** But what is break?

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:17]** So is the first entangled DC 13, and then if they become entangled, the DC goes up to 18?

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** Is that the break DC?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:25]** Some grenades have additional effects, such as blinded or entangled, that apply only to creatures in the explosion radius that fail a reflex save against the grenade.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:28]** So first, I have to get a reflex save against the grenade.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:32]** Yeah, and the DC of that is 10 plus half the grenade's item level, so one, plus your dex.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** So that's also 13, right?

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:38]** So they both get a reflex save to see if they're even entangled in the first place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:38]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** Cool.

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:40]** Let's roll this die and see.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:45]** For Kaniko Breeze, she is entangled for sure.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:49]** For Orvir Pike, is he entangled?

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:51]** Ooh, that was a good bounce.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:54]** He is not entangled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:10]** So the entangled is to break it for acrobatics is a DC 10 plus the weapons item plus your dex modifier, the attacker's dex modifier, or strength check of DC 15 plus weapons plus the attacker's dex modifier.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:11]** Got it.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:15]** So if your dex modifier is five or whatever, then it would be 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:17]** My dex modifier is plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Seven?

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Plus two.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:19]** Okay.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:19]** Plus two?

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** I don't know.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:23]** So Kaniko is entangled.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:25]** Orvear is not entangled.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:30]** Kaniko was the one who was the only one who saw you, Dr. Okay.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:32]** And she did nothing with that knowledge.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:33]** What does she do?

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** Well, you went before her in the initiative.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:40]** The question is, what does she do?

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:45]** It's a really interesting question.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** Because she's a reptoid.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:52]** Because all of you see her face as she becomes entangled.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** And you see her just go.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:04]** You all are so ineffective.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:09]** And Kaniko's face starts to become Dr. Nodin's face.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:09]** That.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:11]** And Dr.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:14]** O.K., she locks eyes with you.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:16]** Pull back.

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:20]** And she says, flee.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:26]** And this voice in your mind is starting to command you to flee, and I need you to roll a will save.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:28]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_09

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:29]** Will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** I will save.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:30]** Will save.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** All right.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:34]** Give me that will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:37]** What's it going to be?

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** I rolled a seven.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:40]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:42]** So now I run away?

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:45]** With your tentacle between your legs, yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:46]** Yeah.

**[00:51:46 - 00:52:05]** For one round, you must move away from Dr. Kaniko Nodens in the middle of your transformation as quickly and as directly as possible, taking no other actions and provoking reactions such as AOOs for this movement as normal.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:11]** You don't need to do it right now because it's not your turn, but when it comes to your turn, you must get the fuck out of here.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:11]** Okay.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** Crazy, crazy, crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** Just one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:15]** For one round.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** For one round.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** All right.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:21]** It is the top of round one.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** And what is going to happen?

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:26]** Orvier Pike is not entangled.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:30]** And Orvier has the first move.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:36]** And Orvier, seeing that, just goes, you all are so f***ed.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:42]** And is going to just immediately turn the gun and fire it at, hmm, who did he fire at?

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Colin?

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** Rick?

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Let's see.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** Who would he fire it at?

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:49]** I think he would fire it at Colin.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:50]** Thanks, Orvier.

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** I think you're absolutely right.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:52]** He would definitely do that.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:58]** Orvier takes this bad railgun.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:04]** He's going to take a step back and to the right.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** Get it and just line up his shot.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** This massive dude...

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** takes a shot at you.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:12]** Oh, I don't know about this.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:20]** This is a 21 to hit against EAC.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** Wait, let me double check, but I think it's against EAC.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:31]** Uh... E... E... No, that's against KAC.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** Yeah, because it's piercing.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** What is it, Colin?

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:36]** Does that hit?

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** Does that hit?

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:37]** That hits first?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:39]** That hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** Oh, I'm two for two so far.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** Only just.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:42]** Woo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** Only just.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:45]** Mm.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** Mm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:50]** We don't know how many rounds she's entangled for, though, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:50]** Right.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** You need to roll a 2D4.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:52]** Let me know.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:53]** Thank you, sir.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:55]** Colin, that is 12 points.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:57]** No, sorry.

**[00:53:57 - 00:54:03]** That is eight points of damage as this piercing gun just hits you right in the shoulder.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:06]** That is six rounds, Dr. K. Heard.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:09]** And she will get a chance to roll that every turn, right?

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** She gets a chance to.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** Yeah.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:11]** Cool.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** Cool.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:12]** Thank you for that.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:14]** All right.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:17]** That is Orvir's turn.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** Takes a step back.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** And Dr. O'K, it is now your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** So do I have to double move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:26]** I think you do.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:30]** You have to move away as fast and as quickly as possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:33]** Okay, so 25 feet.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** 25 feet.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** That puts me here.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** Yeah.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** And then another one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:40]** Yeah, you just double move.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:47]** Can I ask what is going through your mind at that point as you feel commanded to flee?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:52]** Um, I mean, I'm only focused on fleeing, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** So I guess that's like slime on your way out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:58]** Yeah.

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Oh God.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:01]** Slime a little bit in that location.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:01]** Yeah.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:03]** Okay.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** You start running.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:07]** Effecta is like, Doctor, okay, what are you doing?

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** Stop, stop, stop.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:16]** And she starts to try and, because she doesn't know what happened, but she just starts to try and run after you.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:18]** And you've run past here.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** You are back.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:22]** You are close to the room of the listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:51]** all right round one starting off i can't um i can't give bernice any instruction too right correct i don't think so i think the only thing you can do is run okay bernice should have her own that's true action that's not what does grace want to do yeah i mean i think bernice would investigate the trap given that i talked i i like spoke about it out loud um can can that happen or no


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:55]** that she would say what the trap is.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** I think you had already said what it was, sorry.

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:59]** Maybe I misunderstood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:02]** Well, I mean, I guess she would, like, investigate the trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** We don't know what the trap is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** We just know it's laser, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** Yeah, I mean, she would know about the trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** That's for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:07]** Yeah.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:09]** Yeah.

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:10]** Could she do, like, an engineering check on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:14]** If she wanted to move over to where you see that laser thing.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:20]** We're in full combat now, so she can do... Oh, she might not be able to do it yet.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:22]** A move action or a standard action.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:22]** Yeah.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** Because she's unlimited.

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:25]** Maybe she could handle that this round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** She might move towards the trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** Okay, yeah.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** Yep.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** To investigate.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:37]** Yeah, so where that purple webby beam is touching the walls is where you see it coming out.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:38]** All right.

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** Good start.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:44]** Dr. K runs after being commanded from Dr. Kaniko Nodens.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:51]** Colin, you have just been hit by this badass motherfucker who shares your accent.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:52]** What do you do?

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** Pull back, Colin.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** It's not your turn.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:54]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:55]** It's not her.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** Get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** What does Colin do?

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:10]** You notice the anger flare in Colin's eyes with understanding that this is either not Kaniko as he knew her or never was.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:19]** And so you see his eyes glow and you start to see like the angels on his face.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** Thanks, chest.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:23]** Armor.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:25]** I lost the word armor.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:26]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:28]** So angry.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** You can't remember who it was.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:31]** So flushed with anger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:38]** So he is going to cast... He's ready to fight, right?

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** Like, this is a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Yeah, so are they.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** This is a f***ing throwdown.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:45]** So he casts Wisp Ally.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:51]** I'm going to cast that here within my 25 feet as my standard action.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:56]** And then as a move action, I'm going to move it to on top of Orvier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:58 - 00:57:58]** Okay.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:01]** Wisp Ally, you are moving on top of Orvier.

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:07]** I am going to find an appropriate...

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:13]** appropriate image for it, and tell myself and the audience what Wisp Ally is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:17]** So Wisp Ally lasts one round per level.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** I have six levels, so it's going to last six rounds.

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:24]** It will provide either, at my choice, Covering Fire or Harrying Fire.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:40]** covering fire for one ally to get plus two AC against whoever it's on top of, in this case Orvier, or harrying fire, which is plus two to the next attack from after my turn each round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:42]** Got it.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:49]** So I'm going to give us the plus two against Orvier because I feel like he's going to be the biggest obstacle to overcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:49 - 00:58:49]** Okay.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:52]** So anyone attacking Orvier gets a plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** The first attack after my turn gets plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:55 - 00:59:22]** first attack after your turn gets plus two there is a this is not a wisp ally there is an icon called wisp ally in in the foundry module and it just looks like two knives flaming cross swords two flaming cross just freaking going intense all right so that is currently on orvi right now amazing we'll actively follow orvi actively follow hey hey listen yep


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:28]** It's Navi and company that are just like mosquito bombing him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** Stop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:30]** Stop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** Yeah.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:31]** Yeah.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:32]** Cool.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:32]** All right.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** You going to move?

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:35]** No.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:37]** That was my standard in my move action.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:41]** That was your standard in your move, he says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** All right.

**[00:59:43 - 01:00:09]** question is what does what does dr keniko knows do her you see as the body of keniko breeze begins to transform into the body of dr nodens i'm going to add dr nodens to the initiative order is dr nodens hotter than keniko no


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:16]** I'm going to let y'all just simply by virtue of her being terrifying, not, but then I can't get over that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:18]** The eye is so angry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:24]** Dr. Nodin says, Dr. Okay.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** Did what I want.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:28]** Colin, you should as well.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:30]** Come here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:39]** And she uses command on you to tell you to walk forward and you're going to roll a will save and


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** We'll see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** At our next game.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** That's our game for this week.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** We will see what happens.

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:47]** Lord.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:49]** Oh, boy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:51]** The question is, do you walk into that trap?

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:52]** I was hoping Kaniko would be alive.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:53]** Maybe she is.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:54]** Maybe she is.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:56]** Maybe she is, but this isn't her.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:57]** Or maybe that was Kaniko the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:57 - 01:00:58]** I want Colin to get a win.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** You want Colin to get a win.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:00]** That would be the worst.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:01]** I know.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:03]** I want him to get a win.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** The battle for Terrapin has started.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:05]** It's a win.

**[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]** It's not looking good so far.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:08]** Going to be tough.

**[01:01:08 - 01:01:09]** Going to be tough.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:11]** Colin, is this the win that you want?

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:14]** Would you choose losing this battle to get Kaneko?

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** That's the real question.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** Oh, man.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** That's the real fold.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:19]** That's the... If you could lose this battle, but get Kaneko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:23]** I mean, the stakes of... I don't think losing this battle would mean getting Kaneko.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:25]** I think losing this battle is just, like, the end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:27]** But what if... You sure?

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:29]** Like... Did you ask them?

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:30]** Do you want to find out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:30]** Win or die trying.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]** Like...
