**[00:02:06 - 00:02:14]** your Starfinder EDM night, where instead of an actual set of music, you just listen to our podcast, and then you dance to it.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** It's like a silent rave, but instead you're just sitting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:19]** We talked about silent rave.

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:22]** And now you can dance to it, too.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:24]** I guess those two things do go hand in hand.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Did we talk about that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:27]** Because I feel like that's not... That happened.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:30]** We did talk about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:33]** The children listening, guys.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** I still stand by it.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:35]** We shouldn't be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** We're pretty sure we have the... Kelly, have you tried?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** What?

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:41]** Yeah, it hasn't messed up my game so far.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** You would think it would, right?

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Good, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:49]** Did you play the Lava Strider sex track?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:53]** Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:59]** Or maybe you just played over and over the one where you were supercharging weapon and you're like, yeah, you got a weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:02]** You did so beautifully.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:03]** I love you.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:05]** That was PV.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:08]** That was pre-Venny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** That was pre-Venny.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:14]** But he did listen to it because he listened to us for a while.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:17]** Before I even knew Venny existed.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:30]** Before Vinny joined our Discord, which you should if you want us to banter about things not ourselves and whether or not we should have...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:50]** yeah while listening to our show yes you know way in you can actually uh maybe you can give us banter you can give us other banter topics to talk about uh which might involve asking more questions about this or not so it's up to you totally totally up to you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** Yeah.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:56]** You just have to make sure you're available, you know, right between nine and midnight Eastern to answer follow-up questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** Yeah.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** That's true.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** That's true.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** Yeah.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** Who totally knew.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:03]** Uh, thank you for being around.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:03]** Oh yeah.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:07]** And the rules, the rules, paralegals to you guys answering questions.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** It's the most important times of day.

**[00:04:08 - 00:04:12]** We don't even put them on retainer and they're just like, they're available.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:12]** They are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** They are.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** They are just there.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** Yeah.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** They're awesome.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:17]** They're fantastic.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:24]** Speaking of shouting out some certain people, Benny, I think last time we didn't get to a shout out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** I just slid that right in.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:31]** Y'all just thought it was me, but no, that was Cryodaven's submitted line.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** Oh, what did you say?

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** What did you say?

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** What was the line?

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:38]** The line was, I'm going to butcher.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:43]** Ah, yet another fold to the story, to the conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** I thought you were just being punny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:49]** Because that cryo demon, he chose a good thing that makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:54]** And then I crinkled on it, and I was like, oh, it's just a wrinkle.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:54]** Yeah.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:57]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** It just fit.

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** It was a good time.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:00]** You yes and it.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** Yeah.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:01]** So, yeah.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** So, thank you, crowd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** That was a good submission.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** That was a good one.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:07]** You didn't make me work too hard for it.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** I appreciate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:17]** Uh, I actually, there was another part that I meant to send to you, Vinny, that I will just now open up to all of you, which he said, you have to use it three times in the episode.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:21]** You have to use, ah, that makes it time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:26]** I had two other opportunities to slide it in and I didn't because I didn't want to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** You also had other opportunities to say it again.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:31]** So, you know, I mean... John dropped the ball on that one.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:40]** I definitely dropped the ball, but here, if you guys want, I don't know, I mean, the first person to say it three times in the episode, naturally... Yet another fold.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** Okay.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** Yet another fold.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:47]** Maybe something will happen for you if you just say it three times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:50]** So it's just the line is, ah, another fold?

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Or do you have to put...

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** Another fold in this conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:58]** In another fold to the conspiracy.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:00]** Another fold to the conspiracy.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:07]** I will put the full text in the chat so that we can all spam this for the entire show.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** That's all you say.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:11]** Another fold!

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:14]** Another fold in the conspiracy.

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:16]** Another fold in the conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:20]** That is this base terrapin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:23]** That is terrapin base that you are unsure about.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:26]** A dinosaur has a lot of folds in it.

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** Like another fold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** Look at this.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** It's yet another fold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:33]** There it is.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:35]** You nailed it.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** Is it just a wrinkle?

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** I see now.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:43]** Yet another fold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:43 - 00:07:11]** the game hasn't started so it's it doesn't count oh no the game is already a foot come on you know yeah yeah what if we each say it three times naturally if you all say it three times naturally nothing happens no i'm just kidding uh then uh we win the game something then then the entire book is over that's actually what needed to happen they tell you in book one if everyone says that three times uh then the whole thing is over the whole thing is is done

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:13]** Kelly, was there anyone else that we want to shout out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:15]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:21]** We have sort of a theme of me being an asshole to celebrities unintentionally.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:26]** So I wanted to tell another regretful tale because we didn't know what banter to talk about.

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:34]** So this was a couple years ago, but I was in this place called Eureka, California.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:37]** It's just south of Oregon.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:39]** My grandparents have a place up there.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** It's sort of like an hour out of there.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** It's a really small airport.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** There's really small planes and stuff.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:51]** And on these small planes are these little staircases that you use to get up.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:55]** And right behind me was Daniel Radcliffe.

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:01]** And at the time, I was dating a girl who really, really liked Harry Potter a lot.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:25]** uh and i was living in japan so i was gonna go back to see her and i i had a dodgers cap that i bought so i was like okay can you just like sign the dodgers cap because i'd really like to like give it to like my girlfriend is what i thought in my head so then like i turned around and i did ask him to do that and he was a very very like nice guy like he's a really nice guy or he was really nice that day i don't know didn't have like a piece of paper around i mean

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** No, I didn't.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:29]** I thought the hat thing was a cool idea.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** It's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** That works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:38]** I don't tattoo myself, which is the banter we almost did today about tattoos.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** We'll do it next time.

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:41]** I've never tattooed myself.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:42]** Alright, I see.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:46]** I wouldn't have minded having him tattoo me.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** He was like, sure, yes.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:53]** And then after that, I'm not entirely sure what he said, but he kept...

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** saying stuff.

**[00:08:55 - 00:09:00]** So like, I thought it was going to be a very brief interaction because I was just like, oh yeah, please sign this to my girlfriend.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** And she's like, what's your name?

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:03]** Blah, blah, blah.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:32]** like yet another full note the conspiracy yeah he apparently he i did ask him i was like what are you doing up here and he's like oh we're filming like a small film that i can't remember the name of but he kept talking and talking and talking at me specifically forever it's probably like swiss army man or something yeah at a certain point like i like started to panic in my head so like after like 30 seconds it all just like turned to like blur because he wouldn't stop talking

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:56]** i didn't know what to do and i was like a little bit like nervous so then i just kept like nodding nodding nodding and then like eventually while he was talking i like turned around and then just looked forward off at the plane while he kept talking because i didn't know what to do i had no idea how to respond to this man seems like he was trying to be nice and you yeah just expect this cut

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** I know, I know.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:01]** But it's Harry Potter that won't stop talking to you for minutes on end.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:02]** I had no idea.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** He was probably really bored.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** Maybe he just wanted to talk to himself.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:08]** I know that's why I feel really bad about this story.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:12]** It is one of the most cringe memories I have to this day.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** He was like, man, what a dick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:21]** Are you taking this opportunity now to apologize to Daniel Radcliffe for your awkwardness in the Eureka Regional Airport?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:21]** Yeah.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** This is your megaphone.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:23]** I'm sorry.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:24]** I'm sorry, Daniel.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:37]** The thing is, I was hoping that the line would keep moving, that the staircase would just keep moving, but no, because we were still stuck there, so I had to wait for 10 minutes with him behind me while I was just turning away.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** Had to wait.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** It was really, really sad.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:42]** Had to wait 10 minutes with Daniel Radcliffe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:44]** What a terrible fate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** Trying to talk to you.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** I felt really bad.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:53]** Vinny and I are having a really hard time because we're the ones that spark conversations with people in line at the airport.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:54]** You do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** I don't like doing that.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:58]** You wouldn't talk to someone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:01]** I have to say, on the airplane is different.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:11]** I also like talking to people, but there's something about being on the airplane where I'm just like, I would love to just take this moment to play a game or read or prep or just do something.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** But any other time, I'm down.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:16]** I saw Harry Potter last night and the Cursed Child.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** I saw the play.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:18]** It was awesome.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:21]** And in line for the bathroom, I was talking to the guy who was in front of me.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:25]** We were talking about some of the amazing... I would not talk to somebody in line in a bathroom.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:25]** Oh, my God.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:48]** well he turned around a lot of stuff but like it was a little awkward at the end it's like some of these things like you kind of have to acknowledge that you're like that you're like cool that you're like chummy for a second like talking about stuff and then at some point you just you kind of just let it go you're you're like you know it's a it's a balloon and i don't say anything else and i just not it's a little awkward that did not happen


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:54]** It's a little awkward when you're talking to somebody in line for the bathroom and then you end up in the stall next to them.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:55]** Just keep talking.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:58]** No, you just look straight ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:00]** There's a cone of silence inside the men's room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:04]** No, I don't talk to anybody when I take my hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:12]** I can't get into... I sort of feel like I default to thinking that it's rude to talk to people on planes and bathrooms and stuff.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:16]** But I do understand that there are people that do that.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** I'm just not one of those people.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:18]** Two of them are here.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Yeah.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** But you didn't say, hey, sorry, I can't get away.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:24]** Well, no, I did not.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:26]** I just slowly turned away.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** That's what I did.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** And I never fucking turned back.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** It's like a real life Irish goodbye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:34]** And you've never seen him in movies.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:37]** You've never seen him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:40]** I do see him in movies sometimes and I instantly turn it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:43]** The best part of the story, and he kind of left it out, was that like, it's not because the line was moving.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:45]** He turned around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** And it stood there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** He was bored for 10 minutes.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:52]** That's so f***ing rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:55]** He was literally, he was right behind me in line.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:56 - 00:13:00]** Was it hard to understand because he was speaking naturally in his accent?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:03]** No, it's just kind of like the P and it was, it became that way.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:05]** Cause you know, like was still a child.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** Cause that would make it different.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:28]** Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:31]** We should tag Daniel Radcliffe in our posts for that.

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:31]** What signs?

**[00:13:31 - 00:13:33]** Like signs of interest or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:50]** Well, like, when you're standing at a terminal, when I'm standing at a terminal anyway, I'm, like, scoping out the crowd to see, like, okay, who has headphones on, who looks like they've been here before, who has, like, their hood up and, like, looks like they'd rather not talk to anyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:50 - 00:13:51]** Who is a gate lights.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:58]** So, like, I know when I sit down next to someone with about 80% certainty whether or not

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** We're going to have a good conversation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** I'll just put my hoodie on from now on.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** No, I did not show the signs like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** Yeah.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** Headphones are a good way.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:06]** That would have been better, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:08]** If you were talking to me randomly, I'd notice this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:10]** And then you put your hood on and then turned away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** And then I started to take my hood off.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:15]** Slowly, like, you know, contract it so that it, like, closes, like, in front of him.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:18]** Because it was just like, he must have experienced that from time to time.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:21]** There's just, like, a little Kelly's fitter in the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:22]** You put your hood on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:23]** I would talk back.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:23]** You're like.

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:27]** You're like, I'm a Dementor, and you start sucking us all out of the body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:31]** I would tell them I've never read any of the books, and I haven't seen any of the movies.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** Because at that time, I don't think I had.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** This was 10 years ago.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:38]** Thank you for this trip down memory lane, Kelly.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** And I'm sorry for that.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** I'm sorry that you had to go through that.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:55]** yeah i've gotten better about it since but like um yeah i feel like airplanes are no talking space for me i mean that's fair it's true i'll like you know what's funny is like if i'm flying economy i don't talk to anyone but in first class i talk to people


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** It's where you network, man.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:00]** That's more where I'm going to talk to people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:06]** Tell me you're elitist without telling me you're elitist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:09]** But in first class, I'm super talkative.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:12]** First class, I'm just laying down flat, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:17]** You all were very talkative last time with our homegirl dragon, Virignus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:21]** We were talking to the dragon and then she slowly turned away from us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:24]** She slowly was like, all right, I'm bored with this.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:24]** Yeah.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Yeah.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** That's it.

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:27]** She did a Kelly.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:28]** She pulled a Kelly.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:29]** Yep.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** She put up her hood.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** Wait, the dragon?

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:33]** Yeah.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** We are child, please.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** And he's just like, I should have asked for an autograph.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** It's funny, Kelly.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:47]** As I was thinking about it and I was telling Kev, you would wonder why has she been unsuccessful so far?

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** It makes you think.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:51]** She's a very competent dragon.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** So why has she been unsuccessful so far?

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** I don't know.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:57]** And you also think, oh, I really want her to help.

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:02]** And she said she wouldn't help, but she was like, she did say, I've been watching you.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:06]** And she said, I'll know when you come back out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** So I just say that.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** We did ask her.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:11]** We asked her why, and she told us that she was just busy.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:14]** She was too busy to deal with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:20]** Yeah, I'm busy lording over my lava wasteland with no other dragon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:21]** That's why I'm busy.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** I'm so powerful that I don't care about one of my ants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:23 - 00:16:25]** Do we know that there's not other dragons?

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:27]** Exactly.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:28]** You don't know.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** She might have to answer to somebody.

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:32]** Maybe she's in an inch.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:34]** These ants aren't coming from nowhere.

**[00:16:34 - 00:17:00]** she lost an egg i think that there are maybe her her spouse or you know whatever um is like upset with her maybe she's an xl or i don't know you don't know you don't know yet rudy did mention that i think there are multiple dragons and also you talked about asking for help and she didn't seem interested but she does watch you so i'll just leave that there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:07]** She did, Virignus, come to you and ask for help, saying that she lost an egg.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:09]** And if you recall from Corundum, this was a while ago.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** This was many moons ago that she's lost this egg.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:15]** And it was when she came back, it was being taken by Nodens.

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:19]** Nodens.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:22]** Presumably at that time, probably, you're not sure where.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** Was it to Tercalus?

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** Was it to Terrapin?

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** Was it to someplace else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:26]** Who knows?

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** Who knows?

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:27]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:54]** you all agreed you you didn't fight her i was ready for that fight if if y'all were like you know what oh geez i'm just ready to just go for it just tpk you guys and in the series like who knows man who knows you didn't do it that's all right you agreed and said i will help you find the egg your offspring and she said i will reward you when you do so

**[00:17:55 - 00:18:00]** Then you all continue on your way after having a conversation with a red dragon.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:14]** Survey Terrapin as you arrive at the base that you have talked about, discussed, gone through many trials and tribulations to finally get there.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:19]** start surveying the landscape.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:25]** Now, Virignus gave you some clues of what she knows about it.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:35]** She despises the place, and she knows that the starship doors are impenetrable to her, closed.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:40]** And as you were coming up, you saw what you thought you could make out as, oh, okay.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:45]** Especially after you saw the base on one side, the concrete, brutalist, dark, dreary base.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:51]** On the other side of the crater, you're like, oh, I can see where the doors into the hangar would be from there.

**[00:18:54 - 00:19:14]** she tells you that there is something at the door that she's seen and that there are two beings that patrol around there's some sort of humanoid which you then confirmed was a female elf steward and a reptoid beast aberration abomination

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:21]** not mechanically, that is with them and has been seen with them.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:30]** Dr. O'Kay's and Bernice's incredible understanding of gene therapy and biology.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:34]** As you get close, you realize this is some sort of like...

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:51]** strange reptoid creation made almost in a lab or with the aid of skilled scientists who are changing the creature on a fundamental level, turning it from a bipedal creature into a quadrupedal creature.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:53]** adding in strange features.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** It seemed to be almost like bird-like.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:59]** There was humanoid skin, there was reptoid skin, there was like feathers, there's all this.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:05]** There's increased talons, and you can sense that this thing has some abilities.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:15]** They're patrolling every 30 minutes, either standing right around the entrance or moving back up north, and you all...

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:16]** I've got you on the map.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:22]** You all decide to move as a team, walk forward in a V shape.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:26]** It's like the flying V, except the opposite from Mighty Mighty Ducks.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:30]** And Dr. O.K.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:36]** notices that there is some sort of gun port above the door that's hidden.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:41]** But you think, hmm, there is potentially something going on up here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:43]** Question about that gun port.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:43]** Tell me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:44 - 00:21:08]** given its arrangement is there like areas of fire which would be like that i could see it could reach like is it if i were to you know we're looking at this map and there's this bulge on the map could you approach from these spots from the side yeah like blind spots give me an engineering check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:41]** engineering what is my engineering skill 24 24 yeah you think there's maybe about a 15 foot radius around where it will detect anything that's coming here okay so 15 feet and to the sides like perfectly like 90 like 180 degree arc firing arc

**[00:21:41 - 00:22:02]** yeah like a like a like a 15 degree sorry sorry 15 foot arc all are not 15 foot in terms of arc length just saying it's a 15 foot like diameter around it right so so a certain radius 15 feet yeah that is you think it could detect and it's right no blind spots

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:08]** I mean, it's a 15-foot circle, so if you're within that 15-foot circle, it will activate it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:12]** But it can't shoot behind it, this wall, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:13]** Yeah, no.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:14]** It can't shoot behind that.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:17]** I mean, if you walk back there, you can't do that.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:23]** So when we ended last time, just keep it in terms of time check, it's been, it's like 5.05.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:29]** You all moved forward pretty much when the patrol moved back up north at the same time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:37]** And we know we have, we watched him a couple of times, so we know it's always 30 minutes, so we would start a timer for like 22, 25 minutes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:46]** I say we try to approach from this point of defilade around the side and see if we can figure out what this...

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:53]** orange button is on the corner before we... It may be a time to use Chad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:58]** Well, can Chad investigate what it is, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:03]** We should do a computer's check and then... No, Chad can push buttons and knock.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:08]** I could tell Chad what to do, but he can't do something too complex.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:12]** Computer's check, I'll roll that if that works out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:15]** Yeah, maybe just an approach.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:17]** And you could, I mean...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:40]** maybe you could just reach around i mean it's an adjacent square i don't know yeah it's an adjacent square so i i think i think if you're going to try and go into that square you might risk something here's what's your what's your uh computer check it's only an 18 this time i'm afraid okay that's okay uh

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:47]** you know that in order to make this happen, there's some, there's both the gun hatch where the gun comes from.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:56]** And you think there must be some sort of like camera scanner that is actually pulling in the information.

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:04]** You also know that based on how this is, uh, Bernie did Bernice's sister.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** No.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:06]** Uh,

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** Yes.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:09]** Okay.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:18]** You also know that from the way that this works and thinking, wait a minute, but I saw the patrol coming in.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:30]** And you think, okay, well, there's a camera scanner that is monitoring for any individuals coming forward.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:34]** But you also saw the patrol walk in front.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:36 - 00:25:01]** so you think that's an expected right i just just hear me out on this but if they are expecting the patrol if we were to take out those two switch uniforms before they can return then that would draw out whoever's inside to search for them so let's set up an ambush ambush the creature


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:06]** It's possible that the button that they're pressing is a check-in button as well.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:14]** Yeah, I'm fine with that.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** Okay, so what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:19]** Set up an ambush.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:19]** What's it look like?

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** We're almost in formation.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** We're just going to rotate a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:32]** Rick is going to draw his axe and move up to behind the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** Okay, so you hide.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:41]** The door is south, and then there's a wall that's recessed five feet behind that once it spreads out.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:49]** And then on the right side, there's another wall that goes around a corner about ten feet before finally making the last corner that goes...

**[00:25:49 - 00:26:02]** You know that runs north and Rick is hiding behind that that first corner So if they were to walk then Rick would be pretty much five feet in front of them They're like five feet away from where they're roughly walking around that first corner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:16]** Are there any like I'm noticing on this terrain, but like functionally are there any Areas that are lower that would provide some minimal cover or like if someone was prone They would be able to hide


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:47]** uh you think that those craters yeah they're they're like they're they're very small craters that are right to the southwest and the northeast of the entrance those are maybe two or three feet not really the best place to hide they've kept the area right around the base clear yeah okay but as you go further out than 50 and 60 feet you start to get into the sense where there's like boulders you know um so if you wanted to do that you could you think bernice might hide in one of

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:48]** Okay.

**[00:26:48 - 00:26:50]** She'll need to roll a stealth check just like anybody else, right?

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:51]** Yeah.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** Okay.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** So Bernice moves up.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:57]** Bernice has a skill unit for stealth.

**[00:26:58 - 00:26:59]** Yeah, she does.

**[00:26:59 - 00:26:59]** I love this.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** This is some teamwork stuff.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:03]** 21.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:05]** You're going in Terrapin.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:05]** Okay.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:07]** So Bernice got a 21.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** Let me note that down here.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** Rick is hiding.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Bernice is also hiding.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:14]** What are here's Dr. Okay and Colin doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:19]** Should we have somebody out to draw them into the line of fire?

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:29]** And then like, I'm assuming off map there's like boulders or is it pretty clear for many meters?

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:32]** Okay.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:35]** So I would just go to the edge off map.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:43]** Not completely across, because, well, I mean, this isn't a real ambush, per se.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:49]** We're risking friendly fire, but we could draw them into a channel, I guess, safely, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:50 - 00:28:09]** yes that's 45 feet so we'll just say that if you want to hide let me draw a line where the boulders would be um that like i'm gonna say the last like five feet we'll just call it on the map here are if you're behind that line and that's where the uh then then that's where the boulders start and that's where you can make a stealth check

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** That's about 40 feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:13]** So Dr. O.K.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:14]** is going to move over there.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** Okay.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** Try to duck behind a boulder.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:19]** What's your stealth check?

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:25]** My stealth roll is going to switch to Dr.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** O.K., not Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** Right.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:30]** And here's Colin be thinking about what you're doing.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** Got a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** 19.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:37]** 19 stealth for Dr. O.K.

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:45]** I can picture your backs up against the boulder for a second or your side.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:51]** The sun's starting to slowly move into the sunset.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:55]** Colin in here, what are you doing?

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:58]** Colin is going to stack up behind Rick.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:00]** Okay.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:07]** On that wall, he's going to draw his needler pistol and load it with explosive darts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:10]** Explosive.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:16]** Rick is actually going to, instead of his axe, he's going to pull out a nigh fiber net.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:19]** Okay.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:21]** Use that kind of first and then pull out his axe after that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:23]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:29]** So if that works, it'll entangle the target.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:29]** Cool.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:30]** I love it.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:32]** The teamwork's coming through.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:35]** Here, so you're still standing out in the open.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:37]** Everyone literally runs away and what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:45]** So the plan is that we're going to knock this patrol out or kill them or whatever is going to happen.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:48]** And then people are going to be suspicious and come out the front.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:55]** So because of that, Hears wants to know what is the range of that turret that's on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:58]** You don't know because you're not sure what the turret is.

**[00:29:58 - 00:29:58]** The sensing is 15 feet.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** The gun is hidden.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** So there's a 15-foot arc of sensing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:06]** Yeah, and then the gun will open up.

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:10]** There's no way I could find out about that though, right John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:20]** Is the illumination kind of like, is it going to be able to see a target beyond the range if there's no illumination?

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** If it's a camera?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:26]** Yeah, just get a grenade ready as soon as the door opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** Just do a lot of smoke.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:30]** No, I mean, it's a good question.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:33]** You'll have to find out to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:36]** Is there a way that I could hack it to take control of it or something?

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:40]** I know it's hidden, so I don't know if there's some kind of exterior panel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:40 - 00:31:04]** okay you would you would you would have to go up to whatever panel is there it seemed like the steward was pushing on some panel that wasn't quite the orange thing but the orange box is there but then there also is some sort of other panel there so you would but you would have to go in range but the okay got it yeah because the surveillance whatever surveillance stuff is there will see me if i if i do that no matter what angle i come at it from correct

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:11]** Yeah, to get up to that's where you're going to have to be in range there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:19]** Chad, though a very good surfer, is not smart enough in his incorporeal form to know how to do those kinds of things.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:21]** He needs to be told what to do.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:26]** In that case, you're just going to... He's not going to be able to do anything, though.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:28]** Yeah, it just draws them in.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:30]** Oh, they can't see him.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:30]** Chad's invisible.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:32]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:34]** Can you make Chad?

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** No, unfortunately.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** He's called Unseen Servant.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:41]** What about Chad holding a small rock just floating there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** Just a floating rock.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:47]** That sounds like everything we always try to D&D.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:47]** Yeah.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:51]** I'll just put a bunch of ball bearings on the rock bridge.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:52]** Yeah.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:52]** In front of the walls.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:54]** If it works, it works.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** If it works, it works.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:56]** All right.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** What about... All right.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:01]** Well, anyway, then, in that case, it is now 515.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** Wait, what did you say?

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:03]** What did you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:06]** So what about electrical?

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:10]** I don't want to deploy anything or anyone if I don't know that we're going to need them.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** That's all.

**[00:32:12 - 00:32:14]** These are limited things I can do.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:16]** But I do get where you're coming from.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:16]** I think that's cool.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:19]** I'm just going to hold off on doing either one of those just for now.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:29]** Here's is going to camp and just train his... He'll ready up some magic missiles.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:29]** How about that?

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** And...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:51]** and uh prepare an action or whatever it's called for if uh an obvious villain comes out are you gonna are you gonna try to hide because don't you get like a bonus if you're hiding i always forget it's a magic yeah i'm gonna try to hide but like i oh is it how much did i successfully hide in one of these like uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:51 - 00:32:55]** If you hide with Bernice or to the south?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:55 - 00:33:04]** I think if you hide with Bernice, it will be very difficult in that more shallow crater because you're not as thin as a briefcase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:09]** If you are successfully hiding from a creature, the creature is considered flat-footed for the purpose of a first attack.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** So I will hide.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Do I need to roll stealth for that?

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:14]** You do, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:19]** Because the stealth will, like, it would obviously incorporate, like, sound, too, right?

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:21]** And movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:21]** Footprint.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:23]** It does look like... Dirt.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:32]** It does look like there's this, like, small area here in the southwest where it's just kind of like a corridor-shaped kind of thing that's outside.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** It brushes up against the edge of the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** What's the range on your weapon, man?

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:39]** Or what's the range on magic missiles?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:40]** It's magic missiles.

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:43]** Double checking.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:44]** It should be fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:53]** Well, check what the range is while I'm telling you that the quarter that you're seeing to the south is... It's 100 feet plus 10 feet per level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** So it's really far.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:56 - 00:34:00]** So the... The range...

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:05]** Where you're talking about, there's a wall, there's a large wall that goes into the crater.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:12]** So at the end of the map there, there's a somewhat steep hill that would presumably go up some ways.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:16]** And then you look up and you can see the sky above it.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:26]** And you think, well, this is, if I were to go up this crater and look down, then I would see the entrance to the hangar where ships would come in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:50]** yeah it'd be better for you to hide over near dr okay so you have a better line of sight because the creatures are going to be coming up from the northeast and it doesn't matter what's going on well they're going to be covering they're also going to be coming out of that front door probably not because we think that we're going to we're going to target them prior to their check-in so once the combat is over eventually they're going to come out


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:50 - 00:35:00]** I guess if you want to like go around the back of the building or something like that and then like get away from the front entrance we'll have time to reset before the timer before they realize there's a problem


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** Yeah.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:03]** Because we'll have the two subdue.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** Theoretically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** If that works out that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** Yeah, theoretically.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:09]** But combats don't take any more than two minutes plus the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:10]** It's true.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:12]** So it's like 520 now because here's walked over.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Let's see how it goes.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** I rolled a 21 for stealth.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:18]** 21 for stealth for Rick19.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** Colin, are you rolling stealth?

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** And here's are you rolling stealth?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** Yeah.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** I guess I'll roll stealth.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:26]** It's probably not going to do anything for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** Well, me and First Tech, they're flat footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** Dr. K, what did you get?

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:32]** You got a 19?

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:32]** Yeah.

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:34]** Or was it 20?

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:34]** 19.

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:36]** 14.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:36]** 14 for Colin.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:40]** Okay.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:41]** And here's your... Are you rolling stuff?

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** Yeah.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:43]** Okay.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** Let us know what you get.

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** 10.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:50]** Nice.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:51]** No worries.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:53]** Okay.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:54]** You all wait.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** Probably...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:04]** Bernice is not just laying in the middle like, why is this briefcase here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:08]** Well, if they walk up to it, they're going to see the briefcase probably.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:08]** Exactly.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:12]** Which, they're going to be like, what is this briefcase?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:15]** Good distraction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:24]** I thought about just letting Bernice sit out in the middle of the field upright and... Bernice just hold a smoke grenade with the pen drawn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:25]** Do we have a smoke grenade?

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:28]** I think I do in some ways.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** Maybe not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:35]** It's all fun and games until you get stabbed by a briefcase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:39]** No, you can't make a... Dang it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** Yeah, it's too much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:42]** There's no MacGyver rule set.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:46]** She throws dust up.

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:49]** Whoa, look at that!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:55]** Okay.

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:56]** Let's do this.

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:58]** Getting close to the 30 minute mark.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:03]** Dr. K adheres.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:07]** You have probably the best line of sight to see when they're coming around.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:18]** After a second, you see, walking towards you, coming around the corner,

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:23]** You don't hear them, but you see... Oh, why are they not moving on my map?

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** I'm going to restart.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:27]** I'll restart my Foundry because they weren't moving.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:28]** You see... Now's our opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:28 - 00:37:29]** Let's go.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:31]** Oh, God.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** I can't make a move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:36]** They're frozen in place, but you all are fine.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:47]** So... I think all of you hear the soft crunch of... As well as this...

**[00:37:49 - 00:38:17]** odd meter let's say of four like these other footsteps coming forward i don't know if any of you are looking but there's this sound that starts getting louder and louder

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:26]** On the map, you see she's like talking to herself.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:29]** I don't know if you're looking, but you hear this sound.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:38]** It's like strange, weird noises.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** As the patrol begins walking back.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:46]** Let's see if they notice any of you.

**[00:38:54 - 00:39:03]** As they're walking, there's a... And then they stop.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Are any of you looking?

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:09]** Or are all of you just waiting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:15]** I think Rick and Colin are just waiting because we don't have a work site.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** Yeah, Colin's definitely waiting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:18]** Just waiting.

**[00:39:18 - 00:39:18]** Hears.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:22]** Dr. Hears makes little like signals at them.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:25]** Just like waves his little like fingers.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:26]** They're coming.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:29]** Oh, at Rick and Colin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:30]** Yeah.

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** Can you see them?

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** Yes.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** Yeah, that's what I'm asking.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:35]** Because we cannot see them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:37]** They're like 25 feet from your position.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:40]** Is what we mime.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** Okay.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:47]** They point to your feet.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:39:49 - 00:40:00]** You see them stop and you see the steward raise Dave's whatever that is stopped, stopped.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:06]** No, it's just, you'd be like, uh, your hand motion.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:08]** They stopped and they raised something.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:11]** Rick and Colin, you hear a language that you, I don't think.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** No, Dr. Okay.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:17]** You are certain that the steward is speaking in reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:20]** And I have Reptoid as a language.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** What is she saying in Reptoid?

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:25]** You've been listening to those books on tape.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:32]** She's saying, I don't think that I'm alone.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:37]** There is someone else out here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** They're on to us.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:42]** She's doing it into her comms because I have the radio jammer.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Do you have the radio jammer on?

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** I do.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** I've had the radio jammer on.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:50]** I mean, that's going to be a giveaway that we're here, too.

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:55]** Well, if they wouldn't know, it would just be... She'd go to comm and nothing would happen.

**[00:40:56 - 00:40:58]** Or she'd think she'd get through, but she wouldn't get no reply.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** Comms are out.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Be on alert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** She says that into her comms.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:13]** And then she begins taking another...

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** Step forward.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** This is his fault.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:19]** He only rolled a 10.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:20]** And another step forward.

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:30]** And then there's a voice that says, Wherever you are, traitors, come out.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:34]** She waits.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:35]** What do you do?

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** You all wait.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:44]** She takes another step forward.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:56]** We will find where you are and we will destroy you or make use of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:05]** And then I signal to Rick, 20 feet to zero feet.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** Rick nuts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:11]** The steward stops and

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:13]** The creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:23]** Four-legged freak.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:28]** Begin stepping forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:34]** For our audio listeners, Will is attempting to do hand signals for Mimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:37]** This is why you should watch this episode on video when it comes out.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:39]** Exactly.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** How terrible I am at hand signals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:47]** Rick19, maybe you have your signal jammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:49]** Can I make the attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:55]** Maybe your signal jammer, you see the light start to, like, as this creature's getting forward, you see the light on the signal jammer.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:56]** It's like...

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** And then it goes out and the signal jammer goes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:07]** It's got some kind of electromagnetic control or something like an EMP.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:09]** And then it takes another step forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:13]** And when it does that, Rick will throw the net.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:14]** Roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:19]** We are going to see what's going on here.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:22]** That was the roll I needed for the net, though.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:25]** I got an 18 on the die for a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:28]** Okay, give me one second here, Rick19.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:33]** Please add yourself to the combat carousel.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:39]** You right-click on it and click on the sword and shield.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:43]** And then you have to do the dice thing.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:48]** Then I roll, and then I type in 22.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:53]** It should go through and say what's going on with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** My value must be less than 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** Combat tracker pop out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:57 - 00:44:00]** Oh, what is my... Okay, I'm going to put 18.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:01]** Look at that thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** That thing is gross.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:06]** There you are.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:08]** Rick, what's your dexterity?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:09]** Four.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:10]** Okay.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:10]** All right.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:11]** I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** That's my bonus.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** Love it.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:14]** Love it.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:16]** Yeah, dex is four.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** That's his bonus, he says.

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:19]** That is his bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:21]** My dex is a 19, but it's a plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:23]** It's a plus four, yeah.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:23]** Yeah, got you.

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:26]** First combat in, like, what?

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:30]** Since Nyx and Kyro, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** That wasn't combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Yeah, that was just a slaughtering of people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:36]** That was these guys murdering people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:39]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** And there was no combat with the dragon.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:43]** So now I'm just curious to see what you guys are going to do.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:45]** Here.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:47]** Wick is going to throw the net.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:47]** Here's.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** Okay.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** So we got.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:51]** Let's go through and see this.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:51]** Colin, you got a what?

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:52]** A 23?

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** Yep.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** Okay.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** Top of round one.

**[00:44:56 - 00:45:00]** We are starting beginning combat.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** We got Colin.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** You are topping us off here.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:05]** What are you going to do?

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:06]** You barely see this creature.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:08]** Let me show you guys what this creature looks like, by the way.

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:10]** It's gross.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:12]** It's so gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:19]** It looks like an insect, reptoid, bird, owlbear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** So good.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:25]** Yeah, it's got an owlbear's face and then humanoid arms.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** Very muscular.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:28]** What's the word for emancipated?

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** Is that the word?

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** I have real concerns.

**[00:45:56 - 00:46:02]** Or I feel really bad for the artist that had to draw this thing based off of somebody else's description.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** Monster.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:04]** Love it.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** Absolutely.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:09]** Colin, what are you doing?

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:15]** This thing has peeked around and you see it over Rick's shoulder and you see this thing ready to throw the net.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:16]** That was my bad.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:40]** so looking at you wait you didn't throw the net snapping at the beak no i didn't say i readied to throw the net which screwed everything up so now i just have to wait till my turn it would it would have needed to be a surprise you would have needed to be like i'm i jump out i throw the net no i could have readied an action to do this on that and so my thing was as soon as i see it i could throw a net but i didn't say that and so i'm not gonna do it

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** 25 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:11]** Something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** That was so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:15]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** You got little nukes in that thing?

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:18]** You got nukes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** What are you doing there, bro?

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:22]** I'm going to sidestep Rick and step up to the corner.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** Okay.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:27]** Putting me just within 25 feet of this reptoid.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:29]** Presumably reptoid.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** Who?

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:31]** Elven reptoid.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:32]** The elf.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** The elf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:34]** The steward.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** The steward, yes.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:36]** Yes.

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:39]** So we haven't yet seen a reptoid.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:42]** But this creature in front of you that's 10 feet away.

**[00:47:42 - 00:47:44]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:45]** Wasn't it speaking reptoid, though?

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:45]** Yes.

**[00:47:45 - 00:47:46]** The elf was speaking reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** The steward spoke reptoid.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:50]** Right.

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** It's just fluent in reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** Maybe it's just fluent in reptoid.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:53]** Who knows?

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:55]** Maybe we listen to the same book on tape.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:57]** That's what I'm saying.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:58]** That's what I'm trying to get at.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** That's what I'm trying to get at.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** Maybe, but I find that hard to believe.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:04]** And because I just got the spell and I want to use it.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** What's the spell?

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:08]** The spell is called Unmask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** Unmask.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:19]** Let's find out about Unmask Starfinder.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:19]** Read it for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:27]** Embry casts this spell to shame other Embry who break decorum, and precogs manifest this spell by revealing a creature's true future appearance.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:34]** If the target fails the saving throw, DC 16... What kind of throw?

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:34]** I don't know.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:35]** I'll get there, I hope.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** Yeah, we'll save!

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** It's a will.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:38]** It's a will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** Um...

**[00:48:39 - 00:49:04]** uh if the target fails the saving throw non-magical disguises or face coverings fall away harmlessly revealing the creature's face or otherwise showing its real identity a shape changer must revert to its true form a creature can't successfully disguise itself blah blah blah blah blah for 10 minutes okay for 10 minutes so for so so you are going to try and unmask


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** The steward.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:06]** Yeah.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:08]** And see if there's anything under that mask.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:08]** Yeah.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:13]** You're standing five feet away from this crazy hybrid strange creature, Aberration.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** Yep.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** And you're going to cast a spell.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** I am.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:16]** Okay.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:18]** What's the range on mass again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:18]** 25 feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** 25 feet plus five feet per two levels.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** Yeah.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:21]** So you're within 25 feet.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:22]** Yep.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:22]** Cool.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:25]** All righty.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:29]** What is the save, the DC of that save?

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** 1616.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:31]** They need to hit.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:32]** 1616.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:34]** And it's a what kind of save?

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:36]** A will save!

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:43]** So you step around the corner, weave your hands together in a magical sense, and then cast the spell.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** Is there any cool thing with the casting?

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:48]** Do you say words backwards?

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:48]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:59]** I think he very slowly and intentionally rolls his sleeves up to reveal the bear skin underneath.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:29]** and say as my forearms are revealed so too will be your true identity amazing as I reveal my guns as I reveal my gleaming muscles you can do nothing but expose your true self oh good so good you see them look at you


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** and glare.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:40]** And then something about the glare just seems off.

**[00:50:41 - 00:51:10]** as their eyes turn black and green and their skin begins to slide over their body and their smooth elven skin and ears becomes green scales and the ears extend and move up until these like thin like ears that are taller than their head

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:14]** And there's this crest that comes out of their head.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:21]** And standing before you is a reptoid in a steward's outfit.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** Do you have an image ready?

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** I don't have an image ready at the moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:25]** Oh, my God.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:27]** I want to see what a reptoid looks like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:27]** I know.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:28]** I know you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Can I Google it now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:33]** No, don't Google it.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:35]** But I have changed their token here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** A finally conclusive proof.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** What we all knew all.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:40]** At least that this one is a reptoid.

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:42]** You know, I mean, like, that's for sure.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:44]** Certain generalities can be made.

**[00:51:45 - 00:51:46]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** Certain generalities can be made.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:50]** Yeah, absolutely.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:55]** You know, let me, while you are doing that, so that was your entire turn was going and casting that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:59]** I will see if I can find a picture of a reptoid because I do want to show you.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:02]** No, I'm going to conclude my turn by going back to where I was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:03]** Okay.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:04]** Smart.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:06]** And he can do that because he took the feat.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** I know, Rick.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:08]** I know.

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** Thank you.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:09]** Thank you, Rick.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** Rules, Rick.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:12]** I like it.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:12]** Okay.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** Rules, Rick.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:13]** Good stuff.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:21]** You have revealed the true form of a reptoid steward confirming what you believed all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:24]** Yet another fold to this conspiracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:28]** Take a picture because you're not going to get any more proof than this.

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** Or maybe you will.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:29]** Who knows?

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:31]** But just be like, hey, you want to do a selfie real quick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** Rick steps out and takes a picture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:34]** Yeah, right.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Hey, awesome.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:35]** Thank you.

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** I appreciate that.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:43]** While I'm getting a picture up, Rick and 18, what are you doing with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:49]** I attempt to throw a net at this creature with a 15 total.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** At what creature?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:52]** Oh, at the bird thing.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:53]** Okay.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** All right.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:56]** And you need to hit its KAC or EAC?

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:58]** I think it's a KAC.

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** KAC.

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** It's probably a miss.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:04]** 15 doesn't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:06]** Yeah, it flies past the creature.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:06]** You miss.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** That was not enough.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:08]** I miss.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:09]** That was not enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** That's fine.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** It was worth a try because it was a net.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:19]** And then with that, he is going to step forward.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:25]** He's still five feet away from this thing, but now he's got a sight on the other Reptoid.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:28]** And as he does that, he draws out his battle axe.

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** So is that a guarded step?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:31]** Is that what that is?

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:32]** Sure.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** I'll do that as a guarded step.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:36]** Not that that matters because unless this thing has reach.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** Okay.

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:42]** Unless it has 15 feet of reach because I'm stepping into a threatened square, not out of.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:42]** Right.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** Of course.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:43]** Of course.

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:45]** Okay.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:45]** Sounds good.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:56]** I am finding a picture of a reptoid, which, funny enough, I will tell you that there are not a lot of pictures of reptoids.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** Let me help you.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** I'll Google it.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:00]** Google it, but yeah.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:07]** Here is one such picture of a reptoid that is not quite in a steward's outfit, but you'll see what they look like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** Oh, they're gross.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** They're gross, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:10]** Oh, my God.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** Has anybody seen Enemy Mind?

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** I don't know, Doug.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:15]** There's a classic movie called Enemy Mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** I might f*** a reptor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:20]** Wait, f*** with or?

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Listen to Will Saban.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:24]** Like, what are you saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:26]** I wasn't sure with your reaction.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:28]** It's got that, like, Catwoman vibe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:31]** This one in particular.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:43]** They have this mask over their eyes that's sort of reminiscent of gills, green skin, long talons for fingers.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:58]** The one that is the steward, you saw their fingers extend into these intense claws and you see the similarity, Dr. K, especially between the reptoid, their claws and this creature's claws.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:19]** rick you step forward you are 10 feet away from this creature you tried to throw a net and it missed yeah you want to do anything else that's my whole turn that's your whole turn that's this whole turn that's it okay you know whose turn it is now this creature part of that creature yes

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:37]** snaps its jaws, turns its head with every snap like 45 degrees, and then moves forward with a surprising speed as it takes a step five feet forward, rakes its claws at you, Rick19.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:38]** Ooh.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:41]** And just... I don't have reach, do I?

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:42]** No.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:42]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:45]** I wish I had reach because then that would have been an AOM.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:45]** Anyways.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:48]** Unless it took a grasshopper.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:55]** That is going to be a 25 against your KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:56]** That hits.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:58]** How much damage do you do?

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** That's a great question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** 45?

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:02]** Nope.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:03]** Fantastic question.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:10]** That is 11 points of damage as this claw comes at, cuts your leg, and you feel it cut real deep.

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:18]** You think, from this feeling, Rick, you think this thing could cut through a lot more than skin pretty easily.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** Could cut through a lot of different materials.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:21]** This thing is like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:44]** engineered to be sharp so two things didn't do all that much damage because I also am using my nanite surge so like as it cuts my my Nana it's hardened up and protect me just a little bit and I also have a brown force field that I got from the A's okay I'm going to add back my damage for that okay

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:46]** I don't think as much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:49]** So you get hard and use the force field and that precludes some damage.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:49]** Yeah.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** Great.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:50]** Love it.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:51]** Awesome.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** That's a reptorian.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** It's like, yeah.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Whoa.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:54]** Whoa there.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:55]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:56]** What are you doing?

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:57]** It's your turn.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:59]** Question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:11]** Just from this demarcation of the Boulder area, can I move through this area without being seen with the stealth check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:13]** You would need to roll another cell check, right?

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:17]** Because they saw you from before, so if you wanted to, you would need to roll another cell check.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:23]** Let me know then who you're attacking, and then I would see whether you are hidden to them or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:25]** Yeah, so Dr. O.K.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:27]** is going to move...

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:31]** 25 feet, the most of his range.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:34]** Moves forward, slugging forward.

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:39]** Trying to get closer north to the Reptoid Steward.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:40]** And I'm going to roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:43]** Oh, not bad.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:46]** 18 plus.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** Got to pull up the sheet.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** That's a 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:51 - 00:58:00]** 24, you move forward and you think you are hidden from... Who are you trying to hide from?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:03]** From the elf.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** Okay, from the reptoid steward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:08]** Elf reptoid, not the abomination reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:10]** Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** You feel like you are hidden from them.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:13]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** All right.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:21]** So from this point, I'm going to fire at the Reptoid Steward.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** Fire at the Reptoid Steward.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:25]** Fire away.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Cost eject.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:29]** Cost eject.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:30]** Is that the one that you got from...

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:47]** yes the azers the azores yes not the not not the island chain not the azores we're not um yeah yeah anyway yeah okay sorry can i just rewind for half a minute well i forgot i rolled a 15 i think uh is what i said um what


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:51]** The creature was flat-footed because I was hidden.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:54]** Did that change my net attack?

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** No, it doesn't add any bonus.

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:59]** It just reduces the AC by two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** Right.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:03]** You still missed, and also it saw you.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:06]** So you weren't affected.

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:08]** Or it wasn't flat footed against you.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:08]** Dr. K. Whatever.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:10]** Just checking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:14]** I got a 23 on my attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** A 23 on your attack.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** And they are flat footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** And they're flat footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:20]** I'm assuming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:20]** Flat footed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** That's a hit.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:21]** That's a hit.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:22]** Nice.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:23]** Love it.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:23]** Amazing.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** Get him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:27]** You are crushing this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:27]** Not mechanically.

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:29]** Reptoid steward.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:52]** okay going in on them nine points of damage nine points of damage okay nine points of damage um the cost of jet yep yeah and i'm gonna throw in the uh the minor inhibitor on that okay and what does that do again for that reduces uh hindrance on the target the target takes a minus one penalty to attack rolls for

**[00:59:52 - 01:00:06]** uh seven for seven rounds okay nice oh that's a long time possibly the entirety of his life who knows i'm gonna just direct bernice to also fire at the creature


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:06]** At the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:07]** Okay.

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:10]** And what is Bernice firing with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:15]** She's using the cylindrical lens pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:18]** Cylindrical lens pistol.

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]** The photocopy.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:21]** Come on down.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:23]** Cylindrical lens pistol.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** Okay.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:28]** She pulls out the cylindrical lens pistol and is going to 17.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** Fires a 17.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:37]** A cylindrical lens pistol uses charges, correct?

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:38]** Yes.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:41]** As she pulls it out and begins to fire.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:44]** Oh, no.

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:46]** I need Bernice to give me a reflex save.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:48]** I think Bernice can give me reflex saves, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** Is she within range?

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** Reflex save.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:55]** Actually, not bad.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:55]** 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:58]** 18 reflex save.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:12]** She feels like the gun start to move and is able to like correct the action of the gun and keep it and fire off the shot at the creature before anything happens.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:16]** But feels like she was about to almost lose the shot.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:20]** And she rolled a 17 against the creature's EAC.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:22]** Yes.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** Okay.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:25]** That is a hit against the creature.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:26]** Well done.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:27]** Nice.

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:28]** Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:33]** I just rolled max damage for an eight.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:34]** Eight.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:35]** Eight.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:35]** Nice.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:36]** Not bad.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** Damage is damage.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:39]** We're just trying to get in.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** Okay.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:40]** Love it.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]** Love it.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:41]** Love it.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:42]** Okay.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** It's not a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:46]** It's not like the burn property doesn't take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:47]** Right.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:50]** But she relays back to you that she almost lost that shot.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:55]** Yeah.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:56]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:57]** That's it.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:05]** Bernice, get off successful shots against this creature and the Reptoid Steward.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:09]** Again, you have just confirmed pretty much

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:18]** that this thing, and by pretty much I say you saw this thing with the unmasked spell turn into a Reptoid in front of you that Colin might with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:19 - 01:02:19]** Who knows?

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:22]** Yes, whatever that means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:24]** Yes, of course, of course, good.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:25]** Yeah, no, no, good, for sure.

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:38]** The Reptoid, without hesitation, holds up a comm to her mouth.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:45]** And shouts at the top of her lungs in Reptoid.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:52]** And Dr. Okay, you can tell immediately what she said.

**[01:02:53 - 01:03:00]** And the rest of you don't need any translation to know that she has just said, they're here.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** And that's our game.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:04]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:05]** Of course.

**[01:03:05 - 01:03:06]** But that doesn't go through, right?

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:08]** Because she's still signal jammed.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:09]** No, it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:13]** The signal jammer's off because the creature's ability is something about electronics.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:16]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]** Call the dragon for help.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:19]** Dragon, help us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:20]** Yeah, dragon.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:21]** Yeah, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:21 - 01:03:23]** The dragon's sitting on the ridge eating popcorn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** You don't know.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:25]** You don't know.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:26]** You got to figure it out.

**[01:03:26 - 01:03:27]** Yeah.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:27]** Who knows?

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:32]** He better come in like, she better come in like Han, you know, at the end of episode four.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:34]** That's what I want.
