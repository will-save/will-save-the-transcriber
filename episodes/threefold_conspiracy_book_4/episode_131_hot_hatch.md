**[00:01:42 - 00:01:43]** And you want to know why?

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Because of something you're going to announce a little bit later.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:47]** Oh, really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** Yeah, it's pretty good.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** Hey, quick question.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:53]** Speaking of that, do you guys hear the music?

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:54]** I still don't hear it.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** Did you post a new link?

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:58]** Yeah, make sure you jump on and catch that music.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Pretty important today.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:11]** I am your terminal Velocity GM, John Swan, joined by my other free-falling friends here, Kevin Decker, William Garrett, Benny Rodriguez, and Killer Gilliam.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** Question.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:14]** Very, very important question.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:14]** Query.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** Query.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:16]** Thank you.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:18]** Thank you for that correction, Will.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:21]** That was very kind of you.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:22]** It is a query.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:28]** How many french fries is it okay to take before they need to order their own?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:29]** Right?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** Like how many can you, okay, can I have one more?

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:36]** Or how many will you let somebody have before you're like, bro, I need you to get your own.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:36]** One.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:44]** I feel like this is largely dependent on the purveyor in which you've procured French fries.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:49]** Like if it's five guys, then have the bag, right?

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:51]** Because it's an abundance.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** Right.

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:57]** But if it's, you know, I'll be talking like the curly fries from Jack in the Box.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:59]** Don't touch those.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:03]** Is it like a meaty one or is it one of the orphaned?

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:03]** A meaty one?

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:06]** Waffle fries from Chick-fil-A.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:10]** Or is it the waffle fries from Carl's or Hardee's?

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Or the big ones from Fatburger.

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** The big wedge ones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** I don't know if I'm a fan of steak fries.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:24]** Like there's more surface area for your condiment, but by itself, it's like, it's just, it's too much of a reminder that it was a potato once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** I respect steak fries.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:29]** Steak fries walked so potato wedges could run.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:32]** Okay.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** I guess that's true.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** I don't really know the distinction.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:40]** Potato wedges are... For me, one is a token gesture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:41]** Seasoning.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** And density.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:52]** Because potato wedges are like a thicker... They're a thicker... I mean, steak fries are... Yeah, I would... Are steak fries, the square fries, are just real thick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:55]** No, it's like a trapezoidal... Where a potato wedge is a...

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:55]** Yeah.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:58]** They look like a cloud sword from Final Fantasy 7.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** Yeah.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** Like a little bit of an edge.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:01]** Love that sword.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:04]** Those are still, like, really depending on where you're getting them from.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:06]** But waffle fries are definitely up there.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** And curly fries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:13]** Like, if you snag one waffle fry and it's, like, a meaty waffle fry, like, no.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** You should have bought your own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** But if it's... Waffle fries?


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:23]** You know, a gargantuan pile of, you know, burgers never say die or, like...

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:27]** I've been really like in a, for the win in LA.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** That's on my list.

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:30]** It's on my list.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:30]** It's pretty good.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:31]** Yeah.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** Solid smash burger too.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:33]** Good seasoning.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:34]** Nice.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:40]** But like those, you know, three or four, whatever is a reasonable handful.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** Okay.

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:46]** Not like a monkey handful, you know, like you're going for the cookie jar or whatever.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:48]** What if they just put their grubby little hands?

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** Yeah, that's etiquette though.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:54]** You don't want to just place your entire glove.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** I'm not even something with people who do that.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** Like, cause I wouldn't expect you to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** You know, not yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:04]** Benny's like, I'm a with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:07]** I think my, my whole perspective on this conversation is completely different.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:11]** Cause I spent the whole weekend with my, just my, it was just me and my daughter because my wife is out of town.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:17]** And so I took her to a couple of restaurants and like, I would buy a large fry for us to share.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** Yeah.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:22]** Thinking that she would have a kid's amount of fries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** And then all she wanted was fries.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:27]** No, she's just a two-year-old garbage disposer.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:30]** That girl would eat anything and everything.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:36]** We sat at Chick-fil-A for 45 minutes and she ate everything, everything.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** She ate more than I did.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:41]** So if she's taking my fries and I let it happen, cause she's kind of cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:42]** See, that's the thing.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:44]** You do have a small circle of people that you're like, that's fine.

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:45]** I'll split.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** Nope.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** Oh wait, are we?

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** I mean, that's your response.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:51]** I respect my daughter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** Kev's a better dad than I am.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:56]** My kids know if you want fries, I'm happy to buy you fries.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** I will buy you your own large fry.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:02]** And like, I, I love being the guy that does the food run.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:04]** Cause I could just be like, Hey, what do you want?

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Oh, nothing.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:10]** But like, you can smell when the nothing is like, I don't actually want anything.

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:12]** And I'm just going to pick off of yours.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** So I'm actually hungry now.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** Right.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** It's like, Hey, I'm going to go, I'm going to go get lunch.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:20]** Do you want some fries?

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:22]** Uh, no.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** It might, no.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:27]** Any longer than a beat on that note, you're getting your own fries.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:30]** Like you just order a second set.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:32]** I 100% concur with this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:38]** Now, the single exception for me is exactly the one that you brought up, Will, that I hadn't thought of until you brought it up.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:45]** Like Five Guys, because it's the large cup and then the extra stuff in the bag.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:48]** It's more fries than one human should eat in a sitting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:51]** I just want what I'm owed.

**[00:06:51 - 00:07:21]** yeah i do feel real bad because i took i got um wendy's and their fries are okay yeah it's fun like i got the large fry and then we brought it home and so we're sitting there watching tv and amelia was just like snacking on them and then i thought she was done because she like sat back on the couch and was like relaxing so i just scooped up the box and like it was like five crummy uh fries in the thing and i slid into my mouth and walked away and she almost started bawling more fry more fries

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:23]** I'm sorry.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:23]** I should have asked.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** I should have asked you first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:28]** But the lean back is the sign.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:29]** She's two.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:31]** She doesn't know that.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:33]** Well, now she does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:36]** This girl also waves all done and then will reach for something else.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:44]** And then more to the point of your question, John, are like...

**[00:07:44 - 00:08:11]** are fries that are part of like chili cheese fries is that oh that's that part of it that's like a like a nacho i think it's different yeah yeah that's in nacho territory where like then you know one fork bite yes is the appropriate amount like if i'm ordering streetcar fries from spitz fair i'm getting my own and you can have whatever you want if i'm getting animal fries same thing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** Yeah.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** Yeah.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:16]** See it to me, it all comes down to intent and communication.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:21]** Like I, I will get chili cheese fries for me.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:25]** And if you want chili cheese fries, I will get you chili cheese fries too.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:37]** But if, if like we both want burgers and also like, I just want like the taste of chili cheese fries and we agree that we want to split it ahead of time, then I'm all for it.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:37]** Yes.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:42]** But like you, if that's not communicated in advance, I will stab you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:46]** If you try to take my fries, just slide it to your side.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:46]** Yeah.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** Why are they all the way over there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** Whoa, yeah, that's crazy.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** Kelly's been quiet this whole time.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:54]** So I feel like he hasn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:55]** My answer is boring.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** My answer is one fry only.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:58]** Yeah, they have it.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** But I haven't gotten any.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** I've just been eating this con*****.

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:09]** Since last episode, he's just been eating only con*****.

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** And omurice and s**t like that.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** Yeah.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:15]** I do need to find a good burger place, but I have not looked yet.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** You do.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:17]** Oh, well.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:18]** Sad story.

**[00:09:18 - 00:09:20]** One try.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** And that's like a gesture.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** It's just like a bonding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:25]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:25]** What's up?

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:33]** There is one other player here that I didn't realize that I've seen a lot lately is the Papas Bravas for brunch.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:39]** When they take those little tiny cherry potatoes and then they roast them and put some cheese on top of it.

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** And they usually overpack it.

**[00:09:42 - 00:10:03]** and it's that and those have have been in rotation when i've seen it on the menu i'm like i gotta get them because they're hella tasty and like just crispy enough and i i think they fall into the the uh the five guys five guys category yeah where it's like you can like spear a couple you know it's cool we're gonna we're yeah we're gonna split it yeah

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:09]** Well, speaking of context matters, context always matters and healthy communication.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:15]** And speaking of, uh, healthy communication and yeah.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:17]** And sharing your fries with other people.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:56]** Uh, before we were a podcast, we, I started using them when we were just playing D and D and we were not podcasting at all.

**[00:11:56 - 00:12:02]** It is like, it has stood the test of time on several iterations of my iPad and through the five of us playing.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** Um, I think we've played it.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:08]** I was using it when y'all encountered the nothic.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:10]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** Oh, way back then.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:13]** Yeah, it was so creepy.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:25]** Yeah, they have countless hours of music for, like, fantasy, science fiction, board games, all these different sound effects, like heartbeats, fighting monsters.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:34]** Any ambience that you've heard, like in the flashbacks sometimes when y'all have been in different cities or in different rooms or anything, that is all through Syrinscape.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:37]** So we connected with those good people there.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:44]** And you will certainly be seeing and hearing more of them here on We'll Save and on our channel and on their channel.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:46]** And we're excited.

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:48]** We're excited to see where it can go.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:50]** We love... They really set the mood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:52]** They have a way.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** With music.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:53]** They really do.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:58]** And they are, from a GM perspective, super easy to use.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:01]** I had never used it before we did our run of Won't Save.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:04]** And it was like, OK, John loves it.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:08]** And I know a few other people in the community that are just jumping in.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** It's like, OK, what would that look like?

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:15]** set it up, grab my vibes and like click a button and you're ready to go.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:20]** The other thing is because we all play together Starfinder, right?

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:22]** But I have a D&D game with my nephews.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** And if you're running some like

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:45]** larger pre-made adventures they have pre-made sound sets for exactly that situation so like i know if i'm if i'm running uh dragging my spire peak i can grab the five or six locations that i know my players are gonna go to queue it up you know that prep takes like 10 or 15 minutes but that audio immersion is just

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:55]** absolutely invaluable in getting into the mood so uh even if they weren't a sponsor but i i would very strongly recommend them but since they are yeah jump on board sirenscape is dope


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:55 - 00:14:23]** not a partner partner yeah they're excuse me i said the s word i'm sorry eagle whatever it's a good thing we're gonna censor that yeah yeah they're a beep yep that's good we recommend them but like it's not just because of this we've been using them forever and like even even going back to that nothic experience that was the creepiest experience i've ever had with john jamming oh my god and um i'm sure that that helped nightmares not the creepiest moment

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:24]** Yeah, no.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:26]** Well, yeah.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** That's fair.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:30]** Sometimes we just look at each other in the darkness.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:30]** Yeah.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:32]** And then just like, yeah.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** I'm always afraid.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** Talk about vulnerability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** I'm always like, please don't room with Kelly again.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:38]** Please don't room with Kelly again.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** I don't want to wake up.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** He's just staring at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:41]** Oh, you want to talk to him?

**[00:14:41 - 00:15:00]** Okay, I room with the with him and Kevin like in Indiana and they were both hooked up to Darth Vader machines the entire night and I was just like wake up Darth Vader machine Breathing machine Well, look we are super excited They're fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:01]** They are

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:26]** they are sleep on they are quality music and you all know that we care about like quality experiences quality narrative quality show that's like our big thing and making sure that like your experience listening is our top priority so i guarantee you if you've ever in more than 200 episodes i think at this point if you ever felt like that moment on the show was cool it was absolutely uh due in part to sirenscape

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:29]** So we are excited to have that up here at the table.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:33]** As Kev said, we not only have potatoes at the table today, but we have Syrinscape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Yeah, thank you, Syrinscape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** Yeah, thanks, Syrinscape.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:39]** Anything else about potatoes or Syrinscape that you guys want to say?

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** Because I want to play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:44]** I was going to backtrack to potatoes for a hot second.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:51]** I want to ask about the context of stews.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** What do stews have to do with it?

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:59]** So, like, when I make beans or I make a stew, potatoes are usually, like, the starch and they thicken it.

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:03]** And they also are, like, extra special morsels in the stew.

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:06]** So, like, where do we stand on someone forking a potato off of your plate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Oh, no.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** You don't fork into somebody's.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** You don't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** That's wrong.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:11]** No.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** That's just gross.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:13]** Would that set any?

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Why don't we?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:18]** I mean, depends on the context.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:19]** It always depends on the context.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:28]** If you're going to fork a bobbing potato out of a soup, your fork has to submerge into the soup to get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:31]** That's like handing somebody a bowl with your fingers in the soup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:35]** What about like hot pot though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:37]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:39]** If you're invited into someone's bowl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:44]** If the context is a communal bowl.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:47]** You want to just like slurp off the other side of my...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:47 - 00:17:06]** robin not cursed it's impossible to so the moral of the story is consent is cool kids yeah benny why don't we just stew on that one and let's get back to playing for now how does that sound how does that sound nailed it nailed it

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:10]** So, Vinny, I want to ask you a really quick question.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:15]** Last time when I was editing, I heard you, and by you, I mean your innie, Colin.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** Your innie?

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:21]** Yeah, watch Severance.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** Your innie, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:24]** Not your character.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:28]** As soon as we log off, I forget everything that goes on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** That's so funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** Um, Hey, I have an elevator right outside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** Yeah.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:34]** Right.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:37]** You mentioned some dream about degrees.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:42]** I think when, when here's woke you up, you were like, Oh, I just had a bad dream about the grades or something.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:45]** And I was like, I was like, let me just scrub back.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Let me just hear that again.

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** Yeah.

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** Do you want to shed a quick minute on that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:52 - 00:18:21]** want to share a quick minute or no um i would i would love to let me just mumble for a bit while i flesh out what that dream i mean you don't have to you can keep stewing on it if you want um no it was more of like colin's been through hell the last two or three days like i think he's going to have some serious uh ptsd from this and like has had no time to process so like what what would

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:43]** peace and quiet after two days of hell be like and i think it would it would be his body trying to process and understand everything that's happened and how else do you process when you're trying to rest through your dreams yeah and so like yeah i think he's probably his dream was reliving the like lost period on um

**[00:18:43 - 00:19:07]** i forgot what the ship was called the void crier yeah when like everyone got kidnapped and experimented on and with and like yeah yeah we just all lost a day i forgot about that i mean yeah it's speaking of your innies like your your your body remembers but your brain doesn't quite or at least it's not letting you yeah yeah and that wasn't that long ago

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:08]** No.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:10]** It was like two or three days.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** Right.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:16]** So, yeah, that was just like... Colin in that moment is probably pretty f***ed up in the head.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:18]** Yeah, I get it.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** That's how that would manifest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:20]** Okay.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** That's fair.

**[00:19:23 - 00:19:24]** Yeah, it's very real.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:27]** I mean, since then, this is probably...

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:38]** I'd say now is probably like the long first day and night since your escape from Tercalus base.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:45]** You've had like several days of tension and an unsafe environment around you.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:56]** And then now, not only since then, since you woke up this morning, have you managed to find... Or since you left Tyrcalis, you've been able to find transportation across this moon.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** You found shelter.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** You found escaped convicts.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:01]** You've made a new friend with a local bounty hunter.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:04]** And now you're on your way, hopefully...

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:09]** to some place of rest or refuge before the final approach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:10]** Yeah.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:12]** I mean, that's the dream.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:19]** But even finding Solace and escaping Tercalus, we were almost there when it blew itself to hell.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:27]** Rick and Colin very nearly took a deep dive into some lava inside of a car.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:27]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:32]** And flipped it a few times going down that cliff, I'm sure.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** Yeah, that hasn't ended yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:36]** Right, we're still careening down a cliff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** We are still there.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:39]** It is a thousand foot cliff.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:43]** You have a crash sound from Sirenscape?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:45]** Yeah, Dr. Okay and Here's.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:51]** I just want to give a shout out to you all as the MVPs of the last session for just flooring it and keeping it cool.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** I mean, amazing.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:56]** The two of you just very impressive, white tentacling it.

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** And your face would never show it.

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:58]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:20:58 - 00:21:00]** Like you are just, you're keeping it cool.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:01]** You're like, Hey, what's up?

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** Hold on.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Let me turn up the music.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:05]** Cranking dude.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:07]** Lottie.

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:11]** I just can't remember names today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:11]** Top Gear?

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** I don't know where that was going.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:15]** Colin McRae.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** Colin McRae?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:18]** Are you talking about Peaky Blinders?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:26]** For those of us who aren't racing fans, Colin McRae is like an eight-time World Rally Championship winner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:29]** Oh, I thought that was a brand of potato.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:37]** Colin McGrath, the face of Irish potatoes since 2010.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:44]** Let me start with the steaks here, because I do want to be clear that you all are... Steak fries.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:48]** Let me start with the steak fries for just a second.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:51]** Unseasoned thick morsels.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:53]** There's a lot of seasoning here.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:56]** There's a lot of seasoning here.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:58]** because look, Dr. Okay.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:04]** And here's our good on the floor of this, uh, plane, right?

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:08]** You have, you have reached the floor safely, a little jostles, nothing.

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** It's fine.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:13]** Rick and Colin, you realize that if you fail your check,

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:19]** Because you took 37 points, really 30, but you took a bunch of damage last time.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:23]** If you fail this, you may destroy your vehicle.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:31]** And even if you don't destroy it, but you still fail, that could threaten the whole Stuser.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:34]** The whole thing could just be kaput.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:38]** And Kev, I had you roll your check last time.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:42]** And I made you promise me that you would tell nobody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** I told nobody.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:46]** But I did put it in the notes.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:46]** You did?

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:48]** I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:49]** Because he knows that none of us will ever.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:51]** Everyone's going to the notes.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:53]** No.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:53]** No, don't get in there.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:55]** That's the perfect place to hide them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:56 - 00:23:15]** here uh highlight he put him in the chat of course no highlight the last sentence from the previous episode kevin for not just us as players but for the audience out there waiting in anticipation the millions of people

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** Tell them.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** What did you roll, dude?

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** What did you roll?

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:21]** I rolled an 18 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:23]** Okay.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:23]** Oh.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:27]** And I have a piloting of plus eight.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** Piloting of plus eight.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:30]** Better piloting than me.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:30]** Wow.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:30]** 26.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** 26.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:33]** I'm going to roll to assist.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:35]** Without an assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:35]** Yeah.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:38]** Colin is rolling, and we are going to see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:40]** I'm rolling to see if the car is.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** There it is.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** Ooh, wait, hang on.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** Piloting?

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** I do assist.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** I very nearly didn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:54]** Oh, but at the last second, I mean, he's good, and then at the last second, you're like, hold on, shoot.

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:04]** You, like, reach over, pull the steering wheel as Kev has slightly misjudged this extra protrusion, and you just whip it and land.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:09]** I feel like you land where Dr. Okay in here is landing gracefully.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** You all just, like,

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:13]** Just slam right in front of them.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:15]** Just looking right at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:19]** There's a bunch of dust.

**[00:24:19 - 00:24:20]** He's going to give him a nod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:27]** There's a Wile E. Coyote mushroom cloud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** Vivaldi skips for a second.

**[00:24:28 - 00:24:31]** It's like a tape track.

**[00:24:32 - 00:25:00]** amazing amazing wow how does it feel before you when you maybe get out or roll down the window look up see this thousand foot cliff made it barely that was that was one way to get down it yeah that was impressive are we ready to proceed oh yeah i mean don't we have to go up to the other side of the cliff now is that what you have to do i think it was one side off into the distance okay it's not what the map looks like i hope that's the case though because that would be not


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:02]** I can tell if it's like a ravine or just a shadow.

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:03]** It's a shadow.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** It's just so dark.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** It's one cliff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:06]** Yeah.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:13]** And it's also not a thin shadow because here is where the plane, you know, it's like the plates didn't push together as much.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:21]** So there are times where you could just have a sharp angle coast down the embankment instead of just sheer drops all the time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:22]** So you all made it.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** We could have waited and not almost died?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:26]** No.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:27]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** You were waiting for an earthquake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:33]** The ground's going to do a tectonic shift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** Yeah.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:38]** I'll just wait here for this moon to tectonically shift in my favor.

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:45]** No one's got time for that, Colin Edenbrand, you fool.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** Amazing.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:47]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:51]** He's a doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:51]** Damn it, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:59]** I'm a doctor, not a geologist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:01]** I watched Airplane the other week.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** I forgot how funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:24]** that movie is it's a great classic it's really good i saw it for the first time like a year ago or whatever and it's just literally punchline after punchline after and i i respect the fact that it commits to that this is joke joke joke joke joke yeah no break yeah it was pretty fun for an hour and a half yeah just keeps going yeah yeah pick the wrong day to stop smoking


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** I have a drinking problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:37]** Well, it is, I would probably say at this point, you all have traveled, you know, 50 miles or so away from the dome.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** It's midday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:40]** The Dimmesdale Dimmadome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:44]** Yeah, the DDD, as we've called it on every episode.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** Well-known name.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:55]** You are still, if I look, you're still maybe from where Sherry licked the map, you're still about 200 miles or so.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:59]** You can probably see me drawing here to the general area.

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:02]** We're still about 200 miles away from the general area.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** Of the mine.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:04]** On the map.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:04]** Yeah.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** Sorry, I think he's moving.


## Speaker_0

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** You want to punch it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:12]** The mine, however, is... We just got to go to this crater, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:15]** Yeah, she's kind of pointed out to this area here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** It was here, wasn't it?

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:22]** It's that crater beyond the next big lava pool that you can see on the horizon, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:29]** You probably can't see it on the horizon, but yeah, you might have been able to when you were up on the cliff.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:31]** Yeah, you keep going straight.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:32]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:34 - 00:27:36]** Doctor and Mr. Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:38]** You all start headed out.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:43]** The time starts to pass pretty quickly.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:47]** Maybe you're still listening to books on tape.

**[00:27:47 - 00:28:00]** Maybe the feeling of the gentle lull of the landscape is still kind of bringing down all your adrenaline from that somewhat controlled fall.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:16]** And after maybe, if I move you guys probably 100 miles or so, you do get up to the area where there is a fairly large lava pond.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:22]** And as you pass it and you're going along the edge, you do start to... The landscape gets rocky.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** It gets...

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:54]** unsettlingly slow you have to slow down a little bit not mechanically you don't have to slow down that much but you do start to notice that you have to control you'll come up over an edge and start to move down it seems like although this whole planet is incredibly beaten and weathered from innumerable impacts the area that you're in seems to be the beginning of you know a lot of impacts

**[00:28:54 - 00:29:21]** some probably newer some deep some older you guys quiet in the car what are y'all doing I I've been thinking about it I do you think there is any connection to the grades or I just those those two that were in that that bunker


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:28]** Well, we wouldn't know because we killed them really quickly, which is pretty popular.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:32]** Just clarification on that.

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Clarification.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:37]** I never started any of this, but yeah, I did help you by killing them.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** But true.

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:42]** Why do you say that?

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:45]** Because of the tests that they mentioned and about escaping the prison?

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:51]** Like with the dead body that started talking with Dr. Okay to that thing, the grave words.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:55]** I I'm just, it just, I'm just concerned.

**[00:29:55 - 00:30:03]** It seems like everything that we've gone to has been connected and we run into them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:07]** It doesn't seem arbitrary to me.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:08]** Right.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:11]** So like the grays have a connection with everything going on is what you're saying.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:15]** You think they're behind all of this, including what happened at the base before?

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** I'm not certain.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:22]** I'm not certain what... I'm also worried about that.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:28]** I mean, if anyone had the capability of doing it, I could see it being them.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:33]** Many folds, in other words, it seems, to this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:38]** I could definitely see.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:45]** I think they have designed their plan to bring us to this planet, and so I don't see why they wouldn't do that to any other poor soul.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:50]** In other words, we could be playing into their hand, which, of course, could be true.

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:57]** I don't know if it changes what we have to do, but I'm also concerned, Rick.

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** I think you could be right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** As long as we're all on the same page.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:04]** I just want to get the f*** off this rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Yeah.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** I concur with that.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:09]** The ride continues.

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:10]** Thank you.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:13]** I'll add as a siren.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:13]** Thank you.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:19]** There is a.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:49]** time where maybe the drivers dr k and colin you're the first to notice the ground is just starting to build up and up and up very very slow grade until you get to the rim of fairly sizable crater i mean it's definitely at least 20 25 miles in diameter you know pretty pretty huge it's not too hard to just

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:51]** Tip right over the edge and keep going.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** It's been here a while.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** Levels out.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:57]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:59]** and Colin, actually all four of you, give me perception checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** Perceptions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:06]** Proception.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:08]** Proception.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:08]** 17.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** 17.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:09]** 28.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** 15.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:12]** 15.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:16]** That ASMR rolling there.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** Drop it in.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:21]** It's Contu ASMR.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:21]** Go for it.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** Natural 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:22]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:24]** Hey guys, I think we're on the wrong way.

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:26]** Are we still driving?

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:28]** Yeah, he just turns the car around.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:30]** Wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:31]** Oh no.

**[00:32:32 - 00:32:32]** Oh no.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:40]** Three of you, except for Dr. K, notice a rather man-made, let's call it, pit.

**[00:32:42 - 00:33:07]** less than quarter mile away you're still on the slope and it's going down but you can see just off to the left a little bit you can see that there's some some sort of square area roughly that looks clearly different it's like when you see the images of the moon you're like is that happy face is that a pyramid does somebody do that and you're like probably not but also like maybe i don't know do you investigate

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:21]** happy face is that what you said it's not a happy face but you start to see something that looks very clearly man-made it's like the dome do you see that why not at this rate yeah i see it doctor do you see it uh apparently i don't


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** But now that you pointed out... I'll describe it to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** Now you see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:26]** Yeah.

**[00:33:26 - 00:33:27]** Now I do see it.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:30]** Yeah, why don't we check it out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:33]** Does this look like a hewn stone?

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:35]** Does this look like a building?

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:37]** What impression am I getting from this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:40]** You're seeing like... Is this the obelisk from 2001 A Space Odyssey?

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:40]** No.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:44]** It's a... You're seeing... Is it like the bender thing?

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:47]** You're seeing like a stepped down area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:48]** Yeah.

**[00:33:48 - 00:34:13]** like an inverse aztec pyramid yeah it feels like it could be a mine for sure okay yeah yeah um okay all right that uh that mine looks a bit interesting yeah let's let's have a look is this the mine that rudy told us about perhaps looks like it it's on the map it's where the big lick is not sure let me check let me check the notes on my data pad you use your emergency beacon


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** Hey Rudy, we just had a question.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:18]** Did we find it?

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:20]** He's like, oh f***.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:30]** Alright, so you pull up and you see before you that there's this large pit as you pull up the vehicles.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:35]** It's been dug into really dark igneous rock.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:43]** And there are these terraces that descend probably 10 feet at a time in what is mostly a circle

**[00:34:46 - 00:35:07]** then there's a ramp off on the west side close to where you pull up that descends about 50 feet that gives access probably to to the floor of the pit about 50 feet below and as you pull up in the vehicles you can maybe you get out you look you see

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:33]** abandoned equipment large vats a couple of eye beams some conveyors or what used to be conveyors they all stand silently as you just continue to hear the just the slow hum of eros this active child moon it's like a

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** Crazy child.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** Is it small and really dense?

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** The moon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** Or is it...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:40 - 00:36:06]** is the what is the composition of this it's a great question do you will and i were we have a sad conversation got it i've been following a lot it's pretty great i love this how dense this is standard gravity right is it like a roughly three thousand nine hundred and sure whatever mile diameter okay so it's the same as earth yeah it's like yes do you all hear that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** Assisted the bubble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:27]** Yeah, there's just is that she's that will sound the nighttime bong No, that's siren skate Yeah, it's one my favorite episode of the league Well, that's a great episode.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:31]** Let me bring you guys to sleep on the map Oh

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:54]** no never mind i've seen there's a separate map for this mine not liking it rick is out i'm out nope it's like nope don't want the story to progress there is don't want anything to be discovered don't send me to another map you see that at the bottom of the pit there's maybe a 15 by what used to be you know 60 feet now it's more like

**[00:36:54 - 00:37:20]** 40 35 of a floor that where the the moon has started to reclaim the building there are three walls some of them torn shattered chipped fallen down it's all just silently waiting there sort of inviting you to approach what do you all do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:20 - 00:37:21]** Weapons up, gentlemen.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** Yeah, I agree.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** It's abandoned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:29]** Colin will answer the siren's call.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:31]** Colin starts walking down.

**[00:37:31 - 00:37:33]** Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:37]** Rick, are you trying to take the lead, or do you want me to go?

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:39]** What are we doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:44]** You seemed like you were leading the way, but I would gladly move ahead first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:47]** Bernice, make sure they're okay.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:53]** He's like, I'm going to stay up here.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** I'll stay in the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:56]** Here's is not even moving.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** Here's is noping out.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** I'll go down as well.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** Can't leave these two guys by themselves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:05]** It's so fun seeing all you move in the map here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:06]** Yeah.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:08]** Just like one step at a time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:15]** It feels very real because you all kind of like congregated on this as the ramp narrowed and then you started to spread out.

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:15]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** At this point, I'd like to roll a perception.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:19]** That goes into the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:19 - 00:38:22]** Roll a perception, Rick19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:25]** Not very good.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:26]** What is my perception?

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** That's a 14 total.

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:31]** 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:35]** I'll say that... Hmm.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:42]** You notice that the south end of the mine, you know, it's kind of shaped like an ear a little bit.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:45]** There's a human ear.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** Thank you.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** There's a human ear shaped to it.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:51]** And, again, you're 50 feet down.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:57]** You know, it's not the easiest to climb up this difficult terrain on each terrace.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** But with that...

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:09]** You feel like the terrace stayed the same, but the floor itself, the pit, has moved significantly.

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:13]** The buildings and the machinery here look like they have shifted significantly.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:21]** So where the top northern half of this pit, there is still some building standing, there is nearly nothing standing on the southern side.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:48]** It seems like the floor has just started to sink and meet an overlap with the actual Varus landscape As if they've just met in the middle and been kind of sucked in a little bit and off to the south you see some tattered Remnants of you know tarps and material maybe a couple of hinges or access doors hanging off to the side That's all that you notice


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:49 - 00:40:13]** um bernice rolled a 19 for perception and wants to check out this hatch looking thing in the northern corner of what remains this structure yeah it looks like a industrial grade hatch you know five by eight five by ten


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:39]** and rounded edges dirty with soot and i forget what they call it but it has the circular what kev a hand hand wheel has a hand wheel latch is that is that what you would call it to open at the top everything else around it does it look like yeah good


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:45]** Does it look like it's been used recently or has it, is it like attached to the floor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:47]** It's attached to the floor.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** Give me a survival check.

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:50]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:55]** Or Bernie's just, I was going to do a survival check to look for like footprints or anything else leading to the door.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** Bernie's got a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:01]** I have a 21, 20, 23, 23.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:02]** Okay.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:07]** You see medium footsteps.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:15]** Once you start to look around a little bit, you think, this spot here, this spot here, these are not.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:18]** If I can put two or three together, I can see a couple footsteps here.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:23]** Then I see five or seven feet away where they continued walking.

**[00:41:24 - 00:41:32]** Two sets of humanoid footprints that lead up to this door.

**[00:41:32 - 00:41:32]** And then...

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:51]** right around the door you notice that maybe you reach down feel it somebody give me either physical science or an engineering check maybe physical science both both


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:53]** I'll do physical science.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** 22.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:55]** 22 engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** For physical science.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:57]** 20 physical science, 22 engineering.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:02]** Dr. K, did I... Contu, did I see you roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:02 - 00:42:03]** Or did Bernice roll?

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:07]** I rolled... Bernice is not trained in physical science.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:07]** Got it.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:11]** But I can roll for myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:12]** Sure, if you want.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** Just looking from afar.


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:38]** uh rolled a 28 yeah i mean that's incredible that's that that was what you needed to like see what people were doing from you're like 25 feet away colin and bernice and rick are right up near the door and some vats the vats about 10 feet tall and here's is just out in the open in the middle of the pit standing around dr case keep and watch

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:56]** You think that right around the edge, it seems like the material has been heated and scored, sort of, and then cooled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:57 - 00:42:57]** Like welded?

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** I've seen this before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:01]** Well, it was sealed.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:04]** Not welded per se, but just right around the edge.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:26]** seems like that and when you you do notice that there are hinges on this this southwest side and you think when you look at it you think oh i think this is where the door might have opened and when it was hot it left these little divots in the ground


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:30]** It seems like there's somebody inside.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:34]** Do we go investigate?

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:37]** Is this a gate to hell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** I'm not sure.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:42]** I'm very curious.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** There are two sets of footprints.

**[00:43:44 - 00:43:49]** I wonder if it's possible these are the androids that we were told about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:53]** Can we ask our friend if he's seen this place before, maybe?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:57]** Do we have a limited number of calls to our boy?

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:59]** It's an emergency beacon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:00]** Yeah, it's not a phone.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:02]** He's not in our Fab Five.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** He's not in your Top Five.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:07]** Is he, like, a phone a friend, like, times three?

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:09]** How does that work?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** Well, we could also tell him that, like, we found these tracks.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:14]** They might have been the androids that he's looking for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:15]** That's true.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:17]** He should come and help us and be part of our party forever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:20]** Just a dominant call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:30]** Because when I'm thinking about the pair of tracks, it's either those two or it could be... A four-legged person?

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:32]** Well, no.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** The pair that we found at the dome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** That's creepy.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:39]** You think they left here recently and went up to the top of the cliff?

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** Like they climbed a thousand foot cliff?

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:42]** I doubt that.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Yeah, probably not.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** I mean...

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** We made a doubt.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** We can say.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:53]** I think my question to you is, should we force entry or should we possibly just knock?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:56 - 00:45:09]** Given the clandestine nature, if this is somebody's home or refuge, I'm indifferent, but I would say maybe we just go for it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:15]** Let's see how I can open... Do you have any sort of caustic material that you could use in your lab there, Doctor?

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** For what?

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Caustic jet.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:24]** Yeah, to open up the... Because it's not welded, but sealed away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:28]** Yeah, I don't really understand what you were trying to describe, though, John.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:29]** Did anybody else get that?

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:30]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:57]** so was it welded so we could just open it like it was superheated recently and open when it was superheated and so like left marks accordingly is that oh that's a terrifying is that what we were supposed to take away john's just like stone face john why there's no reason to be this cryptic okay i'm just sitting around gm what are you talking about this is just what you do man like

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:22]** what do you want to do oh my god level of paranoia about a i want to open it okay so then how do you i have one question before we do that okay uh i have one yeah does does it seem to anyone else like this door might not necessarily be a um a front door ruse or uh like it might not be designed to be opened from the other side


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:25]** You mean like we can go in but can't get out?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:27]** Or is this supposed to be some sort of prison?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:31]** Is it keeping something underground?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:33]** That's what I wonder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:37]** All right.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:39]** Let's look up the part number for this hatch.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:40]** Right.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** And see if it's got a handle wheel on the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:48]** It's a third-party website that still has the manual because it's a discontinued product at this point.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:51]** So you're like calling the rep.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** So what do you want to do?

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** O.K.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** 's Hatchico.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:55]** Dr.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** O.K.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:56]** 's O.K.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** Garage.

**[00:46:57 - 00:47:00]** How can I help you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:04]** Yeah, I'm trying to find a part for a creepy door.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** Creepy door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** We don't have too many creepy doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:08]** The serial number is WTF.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** WTF?

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:14]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** You hear, like, slow clicking in the background.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:18]** Yeah.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:20]** All right, Kevin, what's up?

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:25]** The, like, heat scores that you were talking about, it's like as if lava flowed over it.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** Does it appear...

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:31]** On all edges or just like one side?

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** The whole perimeter.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:33]** Of the door.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:38]** So it's like when the hatch was open, lava flowed past it, and then the hatch closed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** I said nothing about lava.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:44]** I said it looks like the edges around it, around the perimeter, were superheated.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** With lava.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:47]** Superheated.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:50]** And where it was opened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:59]** It could be like friction from something entering the crust of this planet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** That could be.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:27]** you know I could help open it if someone helps me it looks pretty heavy and then we could see if there's like a what is it called again Rick you seem to have knowledge of these sorts of that thing that you can twist and open it on the other side well that's just the that's the that's how you would try to open it you would try and turn and right but does it have is it only on one side on the inside sure sure once you open it maybe yeah you can check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:28]** That's why I wanted to know the part number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** Colin, you're a pretty beefy guy.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:32]** Can you help me with this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:34]** Yeah, I'll give you a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:35]** He's beefy.

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:37]** Dr. K, you're still on hold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** I'm still on hold with tech support.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:42]** He's got negative one strength, but sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** What the fuck?

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:45]** How?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:47]** Oh, man.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:50]** How is it that weak-ass years has more strength?

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:50]** I post on eBay.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:51]** What the shit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:52]** Hold on.

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:55]** Who wants to give me a strength check to try and open the door?

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** Rick wants to open it.

**[00:48:57 - 00:48:58]** Rick, you walk up.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** All right, go ahead, Rick.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** Plant both feet on either side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** 15 on the die for a total of 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:05]** Back up and make some room for the gems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** Okay.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:08]** Rick, you step up and put a foot on either side.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** You're, like, horse-dancing the shit out of this.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:12]** Reach down.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:16]** Just grab, like, ready to android torque.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** And you just start pulling.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** 21.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:23]** And you...

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:26]** You think about murder botting it for a second.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:31]** And then it doesn't move.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:32]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:34]** That was an almost perfect roll.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:45]** Can he gain an advantage by taking some of this loose metal work and creating a lever for him to apply more force?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:48]** Dr. O'Kay, give me an engineering check because your brain is already working.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:53]** Again, your innie, Dr. O'Kay, is already working hard.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** What am I doing?

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Engineering?

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** Engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:02]** That is going to be 31.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** Master Builder, Dr. AK, I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:10]** Well, I'm staying with Dr. OK because Will immediately came in with that, like, wait, hold on.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:15]** Let me try and figure this out for a second because he should be able to open it and he's not.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:19]** And you think, Dr. OK, that with this,

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** It won't open.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** Because it's welded.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:22]** No.

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:26]** Because... Pressure?

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:34]** There's something about the heating element that needs in order for the door to fill into a gap for it to open.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** So it's not going to open...

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:58]** right now as is it's like you have to like you think with the expansion of the door with the heat where's my plasma and with it being more malleable you think that that's a way that the door could swing open so if i could heat it up we could open it i do have a laser yeah you have i do have i have fire spells


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:00]** If a laser drill works, though, then hell yeah.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:02]** I'll have to use up a spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:07]** Colin's going to put a hand either close to or on the vats to try to figure out what's inside those.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Okay.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** Wonder if that might be helpful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** You look in.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:19]** You see shards of really tiny, fine, microscopic dust.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:23]** Some of it looks red-ish.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:28]** A little of it looks blue, but mostly red.

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:33]** And you think the only reason it's still here and it hasn't blown away is just the cover that the vat has provided.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:36]** Again, the vat is like 10 feet high.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:41]** So if you wanted to go in, I'd say you need to give me an athletics check.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:47]** But you're looking through maybe a couple little cracks, a couple little stray rocks that have just whammed into it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:51]** Yeah, I'll give you an athletics check to go in.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:52]** Okay.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:54]** Give me that check.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** That is a two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:57]** Two.

**[00:51:57 - 00:51:57]** Okay.

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:00]** You cut your finger and you get tetanus.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** Awesome.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:01]** Yeah.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:02]** You die.

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:04]** That's an immediate death.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:05]** Yeah.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:11]** You try and step up and there's no easy way to step in.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:14]** There's no real crack that you feel like you can get your way up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** Maneuver into.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:15]** Cool.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** Can we cut it open?

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** Someone said they had a laser drill.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:20]** Is that right, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** I do have a laser drill.

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:23]** I've never used it, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** Now's a good time, buddy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** Okay.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:30]** So you're going to use a laser drill.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:31]** Pull it out.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:33]** You're just walking up to the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:38]** It's going to... Well, I mean, Dr.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:41]** O.K., do you recommend where should I laser drill?

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:41]** Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:45]** O.K., you think that a laser drill would work.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:48]** Heating the whole thing would be a lot faster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** I mean, that's the slow way to do it.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** We need...

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:59]** The heat to expand whatever cooled this so that it'll be in the right fit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** Well, I can help with that.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:06]** I have the ability to heat things up, so if everyone would stand back.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** I mean, I'd like to have that dragon's breath.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:12]** So I hope that, yeah, the dragon's breath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:14]** This better be freaking worth it.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** I...

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** Or can we just set fire to it?

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** You want to set fire to it?

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:20]** Conventionally?

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:20]** Sure.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:21]** You want to do that?

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:26]** How would we get the... Is there anything combustible nearby?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:32]** You could probably, I'd say, pull a few materials and lay them out and start a fire on it.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** You could do that if you wanted.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** Or... Sure.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** I'll let you do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** It will take longer.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:38]** Better than...

**[00:53:39 - 00:54:04]** wasting a spell i suppose what if not as cool though not as cool uh is there anything in one of these cards that we can accelerate that speed maybe uh i know there's no petrol some yeah okay the that bubbling noise like where's that coming from yeah where's the lava but there's lava like around


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:06]** Like, off map.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:07]** Just around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:10]** Is there a receptacle which we could transport said lava to this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:14]** Do you have a lava-safe receptacle that you want to use to open the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:16]** Is there one in this debris?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** Roll a D100.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:21]** It is a mine on a lava planet.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** That's possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** Roll a D100.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:24]** Let's see.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:27]** Why are you making me break out the D100?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:29]** I assume there's a crucible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** Gotta be.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:35]** I mean, those things are, like, case-forged, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:37]** You got it?

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** Well, you want me to roll it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** I got it.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:42]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** Just gotta take it.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** Yeah, just let it sit there.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:44]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** Much like my drill.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:48]** It's never been used.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:48]** 73.

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** 73.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:52]** You're walking around.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** You turn a corner.

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:20]** there's like one of the teeth like the you know like there's there's there's like a a corner of a scoop of some large vehicle that would have helped to move some of the earth there's like a corner of that scraper that broke off and you pick it up we need it's bobcat you need both hands and you find something is is dr okay bobcat certified


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:24]** He's got a telehandler back on Pabak.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:26]** I think he can handle a Bobcat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** So you grab it.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** You go over.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** You walk up.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** Find the nearest lava pool.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** Scoop it.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:38]** Feel the heat starting to quickly evaporate.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:43]** Maybe Dr. K, the moisture in your arms.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** Come back.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:48]** And you just dump it on the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:52]** Well, I don't know if I would just dump it on the door willy-nilly.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:54]** You just throw it on the door.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:56]** I would spread it evenly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** Much more William-nilliam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** Yeah.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:04]** And then you're waiting there for a second.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:06]** I'm just going to throw hot lava around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** Yeah, just throw it around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:11]** You're Dr. Okay Throws Hot Lava.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:41]** you're waiting for a second and then there's just this this massive explosion no you you go through carefully lay it out like a zen garden just rake it after a second the door you're waiting it looks like it's getting a little red but then you look up and you're like maybe it's just because it's it's a little closer to the end of the day here

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:53]** But then it just very quickly the lava starts to cool and fall off to the side as the door itself turns bright red.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:58]** In a uniform fashion.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:03]** You can see here on Foundry that just the entire pill of the door has just turned red.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:05]** You want to open it?

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:07]** You want to try again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:10]** Does anybody have sense magic or anything?

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:12]** This is scaring me.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:13]** I have detect magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:15]** Oh no, it's a spell.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** I have detect magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:26]** Yeah, I would like to do detect magic and a mysticism check to see what and why.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:27]** That's a d12.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:30]** Let's try that with the right die.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:33]** 25 mysticism.


## Speaker_0

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:35]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** Mine was only 22.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:42]** You all are just standing there watching it, thinking about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:43]** And detect magic.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:44]** Detect magic.

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** Yeah, there's magic here.

**[00:57:46 - 00:58:01]** You think there's something that's been applied to the door, some sort of material, some sort of coating, some device that has allowed it to be locked in the same way as a knock spell, but with the key being overheating the door.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:05]** The door's starting to cool a little quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** Let's open it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:31]** be careful opening it of course uh should i use chad to try to do this because this is still hot so you would cast chad but not overheat just kidding uh so chad i could can we just open it with like this rick 19 i mean how hot is it you're gonna take damage to try and open if you want


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:31]** Wait.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:35]** Rick reaches out and, like, touches it with the back of his hand first, and it burns his hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:44]** You feel like if you're going to grab it, you're going to take a little bit of damage, much in the same way that when you reached into the lava, you took a little bit of damage trying to pull that server out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:47]** There's, like, this structure here.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:47]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:51]** Do you want to go over and grab something and just kind of, like, lever it open?

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:51]** Sure.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:52]** You walk over.

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** You grab a pretty thick I-beam.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:58]** Just take it and... I don't need an I-beam.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:58]** I just need, like...

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:22]** Piece of steel Dr. Okay is all sorts of geared up We'll name the piece of steel Chad And you put Chad Into Underneath the hand wheel And you just start to The piece of steel is named Chad You turn it and you start to open And it just Yeah

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:39]** and slams and you can see that like where the divots were it clearly is uh like you have hit the ground and leave the scorching mark on the floor down below you is a set of steps

**[00:59:40 - 01:00:10]** steel steps are they cool yeah they're cool yeah they're freaking they're they're they're they're both freaking they're they're wearing aviators they're sick stairs they're really sick stairs dude yeah they're just in like drip so much riz on that stair do you all walk down the stairs look up what's up what's up what you want do you all walk down


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** Are we going to enter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:15]** What the heck did I open this for then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** Let's walk away.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:20]** Rekai just nods and heads down, gun first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:25]** Looks like we're going for another dungeon crawl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** You walk in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:33]** Should we, before we go in, should we try to hide these vehicles, perhaps?

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:35]** You said there were some tarps?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:37]** Yeah, you could grab a couple of those tarps.

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:37]** I like that.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:39]** I'm hiding our vehicles.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** Okay.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** I will add some tarps.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:46]** The vehicles are already pretty camouflaged, but you put it over some of the reflective glazing, right?

**[01:00:46 - 01:00:50]** So that way it's not going to catch any lens or reflection.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:50]** Way down the tarp.

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:51]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:53]** Throw some rocks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:55]** Yeah, just throw some lava on it and call it a day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:55 - 01:01:01]** I just start delicately pouring hot lava on your perfectly great vehicles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:03]** Can't be much worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:05]** Worse than a thousand foot drop.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:09]** Colin and Rick's vehicle doesn't look any different.

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]** It looks the same.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** It's been beat up, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:12]** It's been beat up.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:15]** Alright.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:23]** You start walking and maybe three of you who are in front you start to feel at first


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:30]** And then those of you in the back, what order are you all in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:33]** Then Colin.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:34]** Okay.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:36]** Rick, Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:44]** I guess I'll go... I'd prefer to bring up the rear just so I can maybe cover our escape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:45]** Okay.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** All right, I'll take third.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** You start walking down.


## Speaker_0

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** Come on, Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** With each step...

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:57]** The sky from up above, it's smaller and smaller.

**[01:01:57 - 01:02:07]** And you would think that maybe you would start to feel cooler, but even with the door and you think maybe it's just the door open, but after a little bit, it starts to curve off to the right.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:33]** you feel like all that you can feel is the is the heat in your armor and you become really aware of just how sweaty you've been and you've let yourself be that sweaty for hours now because no ac and the stoosers could really cool you down enough but even with the environmental protections it's just it's seeping through and the further you walk with each step you feel yourself getting more and more humid


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:43]** And then you see right around the corner on the right a red glow.

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:48]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:51]** We're going to fight a lava monster.

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:52]** Yay, lava golem.

**[01:02:52 - 01:02:53]** Very likely.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:54]** Lava golem.
