**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** Wishing you all a very hacky new year.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:02]** What do we hack?

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** What's a hacky new year?

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** A hacky new year?

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:06]** It's a new year where you hack things together.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:09]** Break things, move quickly.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** Just, you know, find your way through life.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** Hack your way through things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** Hack your way through things.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** Is that your resolution?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:16]** Yeah, I think so.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** I think that's going to be mine.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:23]** Yeah, I've given up on saying no to things, so I'm just going to say yes to things and hack my way through them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** That was your 2024.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** You're like, I'm going to say no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:27]** Yeah.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:27]** Okay.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** That didn't work at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:29]** Sorry.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** I just didn't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:32]** Wow.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** That was really loud.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:34]** It was very quiet.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** And he's like, that didn't work at all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:39]** We'll just call him out.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:43]** You know, about eight months in, I dropped it right in the bucket.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** And here we are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:44]** There was a channel.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:45]** What was it called again?

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:48]** Vinny's Unreasonable Requests or something like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:49]** Yeah.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:56]** Even that one, as soon as I got that hat request, it was all over for me.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** That's when you couldn't say no.

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:00]** That's actually not unreasonable.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:03]** If there's one thing I'm committed to, it's the bit.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:08]** Did the entire intro with eight black caps on my head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** It was TacoMonk that did that.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** He was like... You did?

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** What ep was that?

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:14]** Backward, actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** It was all the way back in May.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** Did we mark that?

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:16]** Yeah.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:17]** It was a long time ago.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** It was in May.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** Wow.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:18]** Yeah.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:22]** That must have been... Is that in nano territory?

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:22]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:23]** It's tough.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** I don't know.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:24]** I think it is.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:27]** Man, TacoMonk did a lot of requests.

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:27]** Man, damn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:35]** TacoMonk is like... He really doesn't like... Made it his personal mission.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:38]** to derail the New Year's resolution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** How can I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** You know what?

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** Way to hack it together, dude.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** That's the energy we're looking for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:45]** That is the energy that we're looking for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:49]** Will is the ultimate hacker, so I'm wondering how he's hacked 20.5.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:54]** Yeah, I mean, we'll see what happens.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** Who knows?

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** We'll neither confirm nor deny anything.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:01]** Yeah, I've never, I mean, I've never really actually been a hacker.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:05]** I've always just hacked things out of necessity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:06]** Yeah.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Right.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:07]** Okay.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:12]** Although you and I once went to, um, okay.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:15]** It wasn't necessity, but it was for fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** Yeah, that was good.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** I was just turning off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:24]** We shouldn't say where or when, cause I don't want to get into trouble.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** Or what happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:52]** yeah yeah no yeah no details that can be linked back to us certainly definitely not certainly not so what's your resolution will um i'm gonna resolve not to make any more slurping noises for vinnie this year but that comes with a caveat i will do double in 2026. it's like a doubles bargain


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:58]** Benny, do you accept the bargain?

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:00]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** It's a hard one, man.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:04]** You're saying yes to things.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** I'm saying yes.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:05]** That's it.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:09]** That's my timing on that was impeccable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:09]** Yes.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:15]** That's my resolution.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:19]** Not to make... Unless I'm drinking wine, and then I'm going to slurp my wine.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** Or ramen noodle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** Ramen is worthy of slurping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:27]** I will be on the slurp train for ramen.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:30]** We'll all just start an episode.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** F125, we all have some ramen.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:33]** We just slurp it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:35]** We could make love.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:40]** John is going to be in Japan soon.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** The fuzz good.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:44]** And Japan ramen is good, too.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** But John's going to be in Japan.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:50]** As you know, I'm sure from all of your studies, John, it's very polite to slurp.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:54]** But also you're going to Taiwan, too.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Now, I haven't yet.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:58]** I haven't been to Taiwan yet, and I don't know when I'm going to be there.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** I'm going to try to be there soon.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:02]** But like they have

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:05]** They have Japanese food that no longer exists in Japan.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:11]** So it's kind of like a time capsule because it's a former colonial possession of Japan.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:16]** But when Japan left, it retained some of the Japanese styles that are just gone.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:21]** So I'm going to try to find some good restaurants for you that are unique.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:25]** And then you can go and brag to Japanese people, even though you're doing this trip first order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:25]** Please.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** I would love that.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** Yeah, that'd be great.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:33]** I'm just going to boast to Japanese people about how better I am than them because I've had food that doesn't exist.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** That sounds like a good plan.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:37]** Thank you for setting me up for success, Kelly.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** Yeah, that's great.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** That'll go really well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:39]** That's awesome.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:40]** I'm looking forward to it.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:42]** Especially talk about how it's better.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:45]** That's what you should do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:45 - 00:09:12]** yeah for sure this japanese food is good but not as good as the one in taiwan verbatim i need to learn that in japanese too because i'm doing some japanese i'll teach you how to say wow just walk around with like a made in taiwan sticker book and just start slapping it on things uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:12]** You know what?

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:18]** Even when we're not recording, I'll still somehow be finding a way to get people to not, to have a country hate we'll save.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:23]** We'll save the podcast not made in Japan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:29]** In 1951 to 52, Japan lost its sovereignty over Taiwan.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** That's incredible.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:35]** I wonder if that has anything to do with... The culinary scene?

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:37]** Yes, the culinary scene.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:38]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:41]** Yeah, for sure.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:46]** Blazing blistering moment in 1950s, the culinary scene.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** Definitely nothing that happened in San Francisco.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** Nope.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:50]** Nope.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:51]** That's it.

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:53]** That's definitely it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:56]** Kelly, what's your resolution?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:56 - 00:10:02]** Um, my resolution is to be more helpful to John on his trips, but he has coming up.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:04]** I guess that's what it is.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** I want to be better about responding to people in general.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** I'm really bad at that.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:11]** Like, uh, I once like a little while ago on.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:15]** set up my text messages so that they would automatically start conversations.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:23]** So then, like, I made it so that, like, I had, like, all these canned phrases that would open conversations with people that would complain I wouldn't talk to them.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:29]** So it would just send out, you know, there'd be, like, an array of times, and it would randomly choose a time and then send a starting message because people were like, you never talked to me.

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:35]** So I'd send those out, which I thought was, like, a really good idea, but then I would not continue the conversation.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:38]** So then, like, they would just respond with, like,

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:39]** Oh yeah, what's up?

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:43]** So every like two weeks or whatever, it would be like, hey, how's it going?

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:44]** Hey, it's Kelly, what's up?

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** And then like they were fine.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** I would never continue the conversation.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** So it failed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:53]** This is a great idea that you should just develop further.

**[00:10:54 - 00:11:05]** I mean, you could give it like LLM capabilities and then say, provide a summary of the past month of interactions with said person.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:06]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** I would love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:31]** just create a way to text yeah just make ai kelly okay hey did you know that taiwan has japanese food that's better than yeah i don't want to start and then it'll just translate but i saw i saw that silicon valley episode you know i'm worried that it'll like up and i'll say something kelly will say something i don't want to say but but in summary i want to like i want to be better at communicating with people that's what i want

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:05]** The vocalists of Phush is better than Phish.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:06]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:12]** Do people go to Phish concerts for the vocals, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:17]** We've moved on from states and people groups, and now we're going directly to other podcasts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:19]** That's kind of what I'm thinking.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:23]** I'm not trying to disparage any Phish fans.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:39]** it's good we just get another podcast to hit us now by dissing fish so now sts like now we hate you yeah no i like yeah i mean we just call them we've expanded really on japan yeah that's true did this episode yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:41]** to be more inclusive.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** Are there a lot of fish fans?

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** You know what?

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:50]** If you know, tell us in Discord or shoot us a message.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:58]** And then, I mean, since this is audio, I mean, people are going to be like, well, yeah, obviously sushi, but, you know, they're just not paying attention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** That's true.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** Kev, what are your resolutions?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** Oh, man.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** You guys are making me feel real selfish.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** I was going to be like, oh, I'm just going to be healthy.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** That's good, dude.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:09]** That's great.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** That's my new resolution.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** That's great, dude.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** It has nothing to do with you guys, and I feel bad.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Kelly was like, oh, I'm going to help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:20]** No, but you being healthier is helpful so you're here and active and doing stuff.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:20]** It's good.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:23]** We want you here and active and doing stuff, so it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:24]** Have you joined a gym yet?

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** No, I'm not joining gyms.

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:26]** I hate gyms.


## Speaker_0

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:54]** know that's part of being healthier i'd rather run the streets yeah it's like a san bernardino crime lord moves to maryland and starts to run the maryland streets

**[00:13:54 - 00:14:01]** Actually, I have several really good friends that work at the water company and they really do control things.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** They're like, those guys on that street.

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:05]** I'm not going to do their water on this today.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** Wow.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:07]** Okay.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:09]** All right.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:10]** Dude, I learned.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:12]** My neighbors are the power wardens.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:12]** They are.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:15]** My neighbor across the street, her whole family.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:19]** Her whole family works for BGE, which is like our local energy company.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:27]** And so whenever the power's out, she's the one that everybody's texting because she's like, oh, yeah, my brother said they'll be up in an hour and a half.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** My cousin's working on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:29]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** She's like, okay.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** Her whole family is like, yeah.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:33]** Deep.

**[00:14:33 - 00:14:34]** It's nice.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** It's nice to be friends with those kind of people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** It is.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:42]** I learned recently that my great-great-grandfather was the head of the DWP in LA during whatever fucking time this was.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** And so there's stories about him.

**[00:14:45 - 00:14:46]** So I was in the community.

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:48]** So I thought, oh, this guy was really cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:52]** Is he responsible for the plot of Chinatown?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** Bro, I have no idea.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:55]** All I know, he was in newspapers.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** So I was like, oh, this is cool.

**[00:14:57 - 00:14:58]** It's cool to be related to this guy.

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:03]** But the double-edged sword that this is, is that I found out how he died.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:06]** Because in his obituary, because he was...

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:30]** well actually it wasn't just a picture there's an article about him no yeah that would be hilariously ironic but the guy like fought he got into fisticuffs with a police officer for a parking ticket and died in an altercation with the car yo and then he died fighting a parking ticket like literally i told this to my grandmother and she was like yeah as if she hid that from me for decades


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** That's pretty awesome.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:34]** I don't mean to laugh at that, but that's insane.

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:36]** I mean, he went out swinging.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** Yeah, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** I kind of thought it was a cool story.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:43]** Died over a parking ticket.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** Was their name Ezra Scattergood?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:48]** No, his name was...

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:52]** I will find out and answer it soon.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:52]** John Carpenter?

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:53]** Is that what it was?

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** Hold on, let me find out.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** John Carpenter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:59]** Like the author?

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:01]** No, that's not it.

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:02]** Give me a second.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** I'll look it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:04]** It has a different last name.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:06]** Keep talking about things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** I'll keep talking about things.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:10]** Did everyone do their resolutions?

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** No, I did not.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:13]** Oh, you do yours.

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:15]** Yes, I will do mine.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:44]** because Kelly and I always like the same things on social media and I see him liking things that I go to like and vice versa and he is my nemesis I also my resolution is to be more communicative and like not let texts go and not like you know like without like you know proper reason or anything you know it's like just like especially just like chill conversation I'm trying to do that more so finder Adam I'm sorry that sometimes I've got a few days without

**[00:16:44 - 00:17:05]** responding back to you but i'm trying that is my 2025 goal thank you kelly for pretty good about responding to finder for some reason maybe because i'm like a massive listener that could be it he's always just like you know roasting us and i feel like maybe that keeps me on the hook i cannot can i shout out someone please discord i want to shout out um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** Let me look at my notes.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:11]** Zetly, which is how I think she pronounces it.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:15]** Zetly, thank you for regaling us with your coffee collection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:15]** So good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:25]** Every day, basically, they have like a new like coffee that they like make and they're like flavored kind of like those like pinnacle vodkas that are disgusting.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:27]** But apparently the coffees are actually good when they're flavored.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:30]** I didn't know this, but like she'll have like the beans are coffee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:34]** I saw this pop up on the thread, but I didn't read it because I'm lazy.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:37]** The bean itself is flavored?

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:38]** Yeah, the bean itself is flavored.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:41]** At what point is the flavor added?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:43]** I imagine it's part of the roasting process.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:46]** Is it added in the roasting process?

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:47]** Yeah, I'd imagine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:55]** Anyway, I always enjoy all the random coffee things that come up because I'm my own sort of addict and I appreciate you.

**[00:17:55 - 00:18:02]** And also, please show us your coffee mug collection at home, not just at work.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:02]** Yes.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** That's my shout out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:11]** I used to have, well, I have a collection of mugs that I keep at home.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** as per usual.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:17]** But I'd always make strategic choices about my work coffee mug.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:22]** And the best one that I ever had was a Thanos coffee mug.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** The Infinity Gauntlet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** The fist?

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** That's awesome.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** With all the rings on it?

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** That was my work mug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:32]** That's great.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:35]** See, this food channel inspires a lot.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** This food channel is very inspiring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:40]** I do frequently see... Literally, we could have a food podcast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** I think we could.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:46]** I think I definitely think that we could, which was actually going to be the subject of my shout out.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:51]** I wanted to congratulate again, uh, my friend Jenny.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:57]** for the Baker's Bench making New York Times top 22 bakeries in America.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** Dude, shout out.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** That's awesome.

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:00]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** Wait, what's that?

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:04]** Where can we get some of these baked goods?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:05]** It's in LA.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** It's in Echo Park.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:16]** It's a vegan bakery that I would dare say makes better croissants than all of France, which is high talk for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:19]** I think we had already insulted France in the past, so I think we're good.

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:20]** So that's fine.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:22]** Screw France.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** What's the name of the bakery?

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** Baker's Bench.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Baker's Bench.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:30]** That should be their tagline.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:33]** Better than France.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:54]** hold on we have a french we have a aldrian i know yeah yeah so we might lose shout out yeah you're awesome but also your croissant i totally understand if you're like wow rude wow shots shots fired i need to stop but also tell your croissants to get good you know

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:51]** Speaking of travel, where are your characters at?

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:58]** And more importantly, I believe, last time, you leveled up.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:02]** Does anybody... Oh, thank you for that, FX.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:04]** Does anybody want to share...

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:19]** So we want to share a little cool thing, a little nice, uh, aspect that they feet that they chose, like any multi-class in any interesting stuff.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** No.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:23]** Wow, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** I mean, I don't want you to know.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:26]** My level up was pretty uneventful, to be honest.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:30]** Yeah, I feel like five to six isn't really leaps and bounds.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:35]** You know, grabbed another level of Mystic, grabbed a new spell.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:42]** I was a little bit jealous of John's precog, and so I grabbed Day's Weariness.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:44]** Oh, it's a good spell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:44 - 00:22:09]** oh that's a good one uh it on um stf's um drift delvers yeah one of their players also is a precog with that no spoilers but it's great so i'm glad that you got it it's a great spell yeah it's gonna prove i picked up reptoid as a language wow so off air john has repeatedly said you don't know that they're reptoids you don't know that they're

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:13]** And I'm curious to see where this is going to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:18]** For anybody who's on the audio only version and is not watching, my eyes blinked sideways.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** So, you know, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** I hate it when it does that.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** It's so creepy.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** I always knew from the moment I met you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:57]** yeah so should I take off my headphones so you can share with the listeners and when I get to this part in the editing I'll just leave it in there does anybody want to wait so you won't listen when you're editing I can tell you everything but like it's boring having another level in biohacker just turns my custom micro lab into an advanced med kit that's pretty much it that's cool that is good though yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:59]** Yeah, it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:03]** I'm not saying, but it's, you know, it's not like, right.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Yeah.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** I got you.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:07]** I got you.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:10]** This wasn't the strategic chess match of level.

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:12]** And I learned Reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:12]** Yeah.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:20]** Did anybody choose something in knowing that at seven or eight, like they're on a certain track?

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:22]** Certain feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:26]** I would like to get another primary field of study for a doctor.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:27]** Got it.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:27]** Okay.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:28]** Biohacker.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:28]** Kelly.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:32]** For me, I have something like that, but it's also immediately useful at six as well.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:36]** But like, I'm going to, it's pretty cool, but I don't want to mention it yet.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** I'm going to let it drop later.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:52]** One thing that I will mention is that I have something called Harmful Spells, which is reusable every time you cast an instantaneous spell that does damage.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** For example, like Magic Missile.

**[00:23:55 - 00:24:01]** And then you can just increase the spell's damage by half your Technomancer level, which is, I think, pretty useful, especially as time goes on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** That's cool.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** Oh, it's a magic cap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:07]** That's like a nice little addition thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:24]** yeah yeah that's dope that's cool it's cute will you know advance make it does get you it lowers the dc for deadly wounds yeah which which is good and bonus for treating some stuff and the temporary one patient medical lab is good in case you need to post up yeah

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:49]** you know you're like out somewhere and but that takes like a it takes like 12 hours no no it takes oh to to heal for long term yeah but it takes 10 minutes to set up but if you wanted to do it my thought is if you want to do it overnight right you could yeah it's pretty good yeah it's not bad like i'm i'm not i'm not trying to downplay i see your point yeah yeah i got you kev anything uh no sure


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:56]** I don't remember if I revealed like, but so, so Rick has nanites now.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:58]** And so I took a level on nanosite.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** I thought you already had a level on nanosite.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** You took another one?

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:03]** Yeah, so I took another level on nanosite.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:06]** I wasn't very transparent about my last.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** That's true.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:07]** You weren't.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:10]** That was pre.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** I now have two levels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** You did something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:14]** What was that?

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:16]** Your armor.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** When you took a blow.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** Yeah.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:20]** Yeah.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:22]** That's when you revealed a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:45]** yeah and then and i could also like form weapons um so now all i all i got for this this next level was um i think abundance of nanites so i have an extra two night surgeons a day so i can do that dispersion twice or sorry defensive dispersal uh five up to five times


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:45 - 00:26:10]** cool cool cool well we'll see what other cool things you guys didn't mention um my character is also leveled up I don't want to share too much about it so you know it's cool it's all good but uh don't want to give anything away you know what I'm saying but uh yeah they did level up so it's cool it's fun you guys ready to just swan dive back into the fold

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:18]** I want you guys, picture yourselves.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:24]** And if you're a listener, picture yourself on a boat on a river.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:25]** Yeah, thank you.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:27]** Is this another lyric that I don't know?

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:31]** Pre-recording Will dropped some awesome lyrics and I was like, I don't know that.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** So maybe that is.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:34]** He's looking it up.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** He's looking it up.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:41]** While you're looking it up, picture yourselves on December 29th, 2021 for you four.

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:43]** That's when our episode released.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:46]** Episode 48.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** You all were on outpost Omicron.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:53]** You had just lost a companion.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:57]** And you had destroyed, well, killed.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:01]** It was a tough fight against these dinosaurs.

**[00:27:04 - 00:27:09]** You exit that hallway, enter into a room to see that there's an incoming signal.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:17]** It's not long after that, that in episode 50, that you hear the voice of...

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:21]** Gnarly Yalamis, the stewards in that signal.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:25]** That was your first welcome to the stewards.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:29]** And at the time, it was your first connection, really, other than the Belita.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:35]** It was your first connection with someone outside of Outpost Omicron.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** The threefold.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** Yes.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** After everything that happened at book one.

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:51]** And now here you are almost 75 episodes later, speeding away from the very steward's base that originally rescued you from Outpost Omicron.

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:55]** Along the way, you found another... Sorry.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:58]** Oh, no, I just meant that we were flipping them off.

**[00:27:58 - 00:27:59]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:27:59 - 00:27:59]** Can't forget that.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:08]** Along the way, don't forget that you met another companion, Colin Eden Brand, passed out in the flora of the Omicron lab.


## Speaker_0

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:13]** I just want to quickly walk through what you've done since then.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** You've destroyed a two-headed quantum troll.

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** You met your steward's rescuers.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:20]** You destroyed this nightmarish lab.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:22]** You were abducted by Greys.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:26]** You fought your friends who were also abducted, brainwashed.

**[00:28:26 - 00:28:33]** You made your way to the volcano moon of Varos in the orbit of Brithida to the steward's base.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:39]** This led to some strange encounters with the steward doctors, higher-ups.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:56]** forced confinement in the guest wing and the continual furtive subtext that something isn't right and it's palpable like from like i went back to listen and from the beginning you four were like like it's it's a piece of clothing that just doesn't fit right

**[00:28:56 - 00:29:09]** So with the help of Keniko Breeze and the Pykes Peritons, you took matters into your own hands, sought a way out only to discover these extremely odd behavior in the chapel.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:17]** There's this training chamber and this strange wooden Pathfinder time room in there.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:25]** There are these files that point to the stewards as Reptoids that serve Reptoid masters.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:28]** in the city of Roselight on Leofara.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:33]** They've been monitoring your actions, your words, your provocative interviews.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** For what purpose?

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** But they want to separate you.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** So you continue.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** You're leaving.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:47]** You hear a loud explosion in the base as you have told the Puritans that you are ready to go.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:56]** But not before they told you that Dr. Rel Nodens and Orvier Pike, leader of the Pike's Peritons, were seen aboard another ship.

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:00]** And then the static cut off and there was an explosion.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** You run to the garage.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:10]** You fight for your lives against the stewards and base leader Jock's herd, who then also at one point spares Rick 19's life.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:37]** dr okay pulls some awesome maneuvers with the car kelly or here's is it invisible you guys are working i i would say as one of the most coordinated times as a team that i've seen you work and i was really impressed because you boom boom boom against all these odds against more enemies coming at you you got out and as you're pulling away you felt this similar sensation start to run up your spine as you leveled up

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:46]** And let's go back to that moment because looking behind you, maybe in the rearview mirror for some of you, Dr. O.K.

**[00:30:46 - 00:30:47]** and Rick, you were in one car.

**[00:30:47 - 00:30:48]** Dr.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:50]** O.K., you had pulled around and popped open the door.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** Rick got in.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:56]** And here's, and Colin, you are in the other stolen police cruiser.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:58]** Kev is uh-uh-uh me right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:59 - 00:31:00]** Who was who?

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** Not according to my notes.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:07]** According to my notes, Hears was in the car with Dr. O.K.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:09]** Rick climbed into Colin's car with Bernice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:10 - 00:31:10]** I am wrong.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:12]** I'm wrong.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:12]** Thank you.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:17]** Appreciate that.

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** But still, it was dramatic.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:21]** It was very dramatic and very cinematic.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:25]** Great ending to that whole little chapter there.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:26]** And as you're pulling away...

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:36]** And the dark facade of the steward's base in the rearview mirror matches the thick black smoke that you can see billowing from the other side of the base.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:42]** You don't know what happened, but you heard an explosion and you felt a rumbling.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:52]** Before I give it over to you all and go into a little theater of the mind, before we do that, I've got a question.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:58]** There are some things that I thought maybe you all might be thinking, in addition to whatever you already have going on.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:03]** You know, Colin, Kaniko's status, unknown, but you don't think it's good.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:06]** Outlook is not good.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:14]** You might have lost her, this romantic connection that you had just blossomed a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:16]** She hasn't replied to any of your text messages.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** She hasn't replied.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:20]** That's nothing new.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:24]** One way or another, she's ghosting you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:25]** We were working on it.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:28]** We were doing good.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:31]** We were wingmanning you good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** Now she's ghosting him for real, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:35]** Any of your...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:37]** Ghost in you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:39]** If you wanted to revive her, I was probably going to throw up a spell.

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:42]** Sorry, I'm just going to say, yeah.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:49]** I could maybe, I could do ghost sounds and just have her kind of... Let's unpack that later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:51]** Let's unpack that later.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:56]** Put a pin in that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:58]** Rick, why were you spared?

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:00]** Why were you spared?

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:02]** You've become a necromancer, Jesper.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:02]** Dr.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** O.K., what else could...

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:07]** Dr. Nodens have been looking for.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:08]** She wanted your blood.

**[00:33:08 - 00:33:09]** She was asking all these questions.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:13]** She was trying to sow discord.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:17]** And here's why were they so interested in your puck?

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:21]** Shay never gave you an update about it.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:29]** So with those in mind, let's just in theater of the mind, what are the four of you doing?

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** Two of you in each car.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:34]** Here's in Dr. Okay, as I correct myself, Colin and Rick.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:35]** What are you doing?

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:38]** You're speeding away across the fiery landscape.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:40]** It's late afternoon.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:43]** The sun is starting to go down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:49]** What do you do?

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:52]** He's piloting a vehicle, obviously.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:58]** You've got to dodge the lava pits or whatever the landscape of...

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** You know, Varos is.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:01]** Varos?

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** Is that where?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:02]** Varos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** V-A-R-O-S.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** Moon of Brithida.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:09]** Dodge, dip, drive, and dodge?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:09]** I think that's it.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** Dodge, yeah, dodge, duck, dip, drive, and dodge.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** Oh, dodge, drift, drive, and drive.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:24]** I think Colin is upset for a lot of reasons.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:30]** This base was obviously a sham of whatever it was intended to be.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:37]** Still uncertain exactly as to why they were trying to detain or for how long.

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:43]** What they hoped to gain from this additional information on the Greys...

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:52]** Obviously, that burgeoning romance between Colin and Keniko was something he would have liked to explore more.

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:57]** But at the end of the day, when the guns start blazing, it's time to get out of Dodge.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:59]** And drift.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** You didn't save your girlfriend.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** She seemed like she could hold her own.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Obviously, he was wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:05]** Who knows?

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** Yeah, she did seem that way.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:07]** Yeah.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** She did seem that way.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** She was very capable.

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** She's an independent one.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:12]** I agree.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:17]** I think Dr. K is just driving.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:23]** Like, I imagine it being kind of like F-Zero, that video game.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:25]** And just trying to avoid the lava.

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:29]** I'll say... I think the adrenaline is just pumping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:29 - 00:35:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:33]** And I'm... I guess yours is next to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:35]** He's still holding his two middle fingers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:49]** While the adrenaline's pumping, you maybe, Dr. O'Kay, maybe you're checking your mirrors, always looking back, waiting, looking to see if there's a little speck on the distance that's gonna grow larger and larger.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:54]** Seeing if they're trying to grab my fluids or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:55 - 00:36:04]** I don't know how long it takes, five, 10 minutes for the, you know, I don't know too much about Osharu physiology and how long it takes for the adrenaline to flush through.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:11]** But after a while you start to, nothing's coming up in the rear view.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** Just got one greasy tentacle on the wheel then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** Where do you want to go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:18]** To the other place.

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** John, I have somewhere I want to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** The jail, but...

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:28]** I want to go to that other other base, the one that you said exists, but it's probably just your canon.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** The other Charger base.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:34]** That one base that was, yeah, yeah, the other Charger base.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:38]** The one thing that's a song from that Grateful Dead album, what's it called?

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Terrapin Station?

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:41]** You kept saying it was a thing and it's on the map.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:45]** I don't know what's going to happen, but I just want to ask you if we can go there.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** Like, you know what I mean?

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** Well, we know there's a prison for a couple things.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** You know the base that you created.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:54]** Well, yeah, but... I mean, do you all pull over?

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** Do you, like, stop and, like, talk?

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:58]** Do you, like, keep some comms going?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:59 - 00:36:59]** Right.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:02]** I didn't want to assume that there were comms between the two cars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:07]** But, like... We're also close enough that our regular comms... Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:08]** Right, right, right, right, right.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** Yeah.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** Are we heading to the prison?

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:15]** Or the... This Terrapin place?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:17]** I don't want to go to the Terrapin place.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** We don't know what's there.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:23]** And metagaming, John, you made a big deal of this, all right?

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:33]** Like, you know, with all the clues you've been dropping about, like, really... There's relationships to this Terrapin Station and the Grateful Dead in general, like, that you've woven in some way.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:35]** I don't know how significant it is.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:35]** But, yeah.

**[00:37:37 - 00:37:43]** I... I say we, uh... I really want to go to Terrapin Station.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:43]** I don't know.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:48]** I know it might seem like a little bit of a... I think it could help us get to the bottom of this mystery.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:50 - 00:38:09]** I don't disagree, but I would say that if our Reptoid would-be captors captured anyone else, they might also have some details as well as perhaps be amenable to our cause.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:12]** Freeing the prisoners would be advantageous to us.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:13]** Which is to get the heck out of here.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:15]** That is my vote.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:19]** Yeah, or in, like, metagame, make more problems for- for Reptoids.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** I- I understand.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:29]** I, uh, I- I guess, like, my worry is that if we- if we go to the prison, it might be, like, a point of no return.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** We can't see Terrapin Station again.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:39]** We've been in so many situations where we just can't turn back anymore, an explosion will happen, get chased out, whatever.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:41]** I- I- I understand.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:45]** I think it's logical to go and try to free the prisoners, um,

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:51]** But I still, I got to stand by the vote just because I really want to get to the bottom of what's going on.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:56]** And it feels like it's a very, it feels like it has some significance.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** That's all.

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** It's just intuition.

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** Nothing more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:05]** Maybe one of you wants to give me a computer's check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:08]** I can roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:08]** 21.

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:09]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:09 - 00:39:10]** I got 21.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:12]** I got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:14]** I'm going to kick Rick's ass real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** Give me one second.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:19]** Because normally I would be able to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:19]** Oh, John.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:20]** 37.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:21]** 37.

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:22]** Okay.

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:24]** And a match point, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:46]** Now that you're out from Tyrcalis base, if you recall when you were in the command center, you remember that Tyrcalis is in this, like, comms black hole, sort of.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:54]** Everything that leaves Tyrcalis, the only way it can get off of Varos was through a call sign terrapin.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:59]** So anything that you send out has to go through Terrapin Station.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:11]** And there was another note about you notice that somebody's like monitoring some narrowband communication.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:23]** So maybe in the back of your mind, as Dr. O'Kay is cruising and the adrenaline leaves your shearing body, you pull out your data pad and you're

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** You're just looking for comms.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** You're looking for pings.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** You're just seeing what you can see.

**[00:40:31 - 00:40:38]** You do... It takes maybe like five, ten minutes because you realize you have to hook up into the police cruiser.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:43]** You have to use that to amplify searching and seeing what you can find.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:47]** And you realize that you see pings of...

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:53]** the Void Crier, having left Tercala's base.

**[00:40:55 - 00:41:02]** So the Peritons were on their ship.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:06]** And Dr. Nodens and Orvier Pike were on the Void Crier.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:13]** And you heard Kaniko say, they're going to unload their weapons array on us.

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:16]** And then now you're seeing here is this transponder ping.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:18]** And

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:23]** You see that right now it's headed across Veros.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:29]** It's maybe 100 miles away, but it's moving at a much faster clip than you are.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:32]** Which we can get into your vehicle speed.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:35]** Away from us, though.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:38]** You think... They're not coming our direction.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:38]** They are not.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:41]** They are not.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:43]** No, they're headed to the southeast.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:47]** And we'll say for this, you guys are headed to the north a bit.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:53]** So you can track it going for a little while.

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:58]** And again, you see this cover in any communication.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:05]** You can see it layered in the data that any communication that is leaving is going through Terrapin Station.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:12]** You all can call up a map that's in the police cruiser and I'll bring up the map.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:12]** Okay.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:13]** Right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:19]** And for what it's worth, John, Rick still has a signal jammer broadcasting.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:19]** Okay.

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** I don't know what that's going to affect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** So then maybe you were jamming.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** Here's a signal.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:28]** Better not.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:30]** Can anyone see this map or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** Yep.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** Yes.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:32]** There it is.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:34]** Now I can see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:39]** So you should be seeing before you a rather large map with a compass star in the bottom right.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** And...

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** We'll say right now I'm going to move your token.

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:48]** You haven't gone 25 miles, but let's say you've moved a little north of the base.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:51]** You can see that the ship is moving southeast.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:59]** And if you pull up the map across several rivers of lava, cliffs...

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:02]** lakes of lava, craters.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** You can see that down in the southeast.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:12]** There is another building that if you recall, there was an emergency symbol in one of the other maps that you had.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:15]** And you think that is Terrapin stations.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** Oh, no.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:18]** Tercalus is where you are now.

**[00:43:18 - 00:43:19]** Yeah, there it is.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:22]** So guys, I can tell you this.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** The distance between.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** Yeah.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:27]** Each square here is about 25 miles.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:33]** The distance here is a 500 plus.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:36]** And if the grid doesn't support that, I can fix it.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:40]** But it's about 500 miles between Terrapin and Tercalus.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:45]** So Turkelis is 50 miles square.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** It's not to scale.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** It's okay.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** It's just blown up for ease of use.

**[00:43:52 - 00:44:01]** So if you think about it, you feel like Terrapin is a way for you to be able to reach the outside world.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:07]** But also, that's the only spaceship that you know of on Varos that's functioning right now.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** Is the Void Cryer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:08]** I vote.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:09]** The Void Cryer?

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:11]** But the Void Cryer's been taken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:13]** So wait, where was the prison at?

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:16]** The prison's not on the map.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:18]** But it is within another area?

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** It's on Varos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:20 - 00:44:22]** It's further away than Terrapin.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** Is that what you're saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:25]** No, I think... Is it further away?

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:28]** Okay, so let's just go to Terrapin then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** Now, John, you said that the... Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** Go ahead, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:33]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:38]** Well, I obviously... Given this information, I can see Terrapin sounds like the right choice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** He is right again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** I'll just record that on my data pad.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:43]** All right, 53 points.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:43]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:48]** Colin's going to grab his data pad and just send a quick message to Keniko.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** Sitrep?

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:51]** Are you okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:54]** It's a good idea, Colin.

**[00:44:54 - 00:44:56]** No one talk and no one say anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:00]** It's normally a blue bubble, but it shows up green.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** It shows up green and it doesn't show up delivered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:10]** Get a nice big circle with an explanation point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:18]** John, you said that... Did you say that the Voidcrier went to Terrapin, though?

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:19]** Is that what you said earlier?

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** Or no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:31]** It's only been, let's say, 30 minutes since you all... I've taken the timer off the screen, but it's only been about 30 minutes since you all left, let's say.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:32]** And you're cruising.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:34]** But given how...

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:42]** this planet is, or this moon has a lot of craters and stuff.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** There's no roads.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** There's no roads.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** So you're not...

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:51]** and zoom in, you have to be a pretty active pilot to make sure that you're going over that terrain.

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:54]** So with that, you can tell that it is heading southeast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** Which direction is the prison?

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:00]** Is it also southeast, but just further to the southeast than Terrapin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** No, the prison is directly south.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** It's not on the map.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:04]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:08]** So then they might... It doesn't exist.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:14]** The Voidcrier is right now presumably inhabited by...

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:17]** It could be by the Reptoids, but it is possible.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:22]** Well, according to those communications, did it say who was piloting it or it just said that it left?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:27]** Kaniko said that she saw Orvir and Dr. Nodens on the Void Crier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:31]** But it is possible that Kaniko might have been able to turn the tide of whatever happened.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:37]** I don't know, but like maybe, we don't know for sure who's on the Void Crier.

**[00:46:37 - 00:46:46]** So basically if we go to Terrapin, which would be cool because it's something that is, I feel like unique to Will Save perhaps, not spoilery too much.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:49]** We might encounter either the Reptoids or friends.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:52]** But maybe more likely the Reptoids and the balance of things.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** I don't know.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** But I'm just saying we got to be prepared for that.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:59]** Yeah, that's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:00]** It's your only... I'm still down to go.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:01]** It's your bird in the hand.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** Yeah.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** I'll tell you while you're... All right.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** Sorry, we're good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:09]** No, let's just... Let's hop to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:15]** I think it is safe to assume that the people piloting that ship are not friendly.

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** And so we should go in there cautiously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:20]** We should be sneaky, as is on brand for us.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** We can do that.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:28]** Oh, only if you agree with that, Rick, and only if you don't want to shout our presence to them and also let them know that we know they're Reptoids.

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:31]** I just want to throw that out there that maybe you don't want to do that.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:32]** But we know they're Reptoids.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:38]** Yeah, let's keep that to ourselves when we go inside and not just try to create an altercation.


## Speaker_0

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** You know what I mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:46]** Just saying sincerely here is don't want to end up in a situation like we just ended up in a little while ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:46]** All right.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:52]** As long as they don't get grabby with the, uh, sharp fluids.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** Yeah.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** And yeah, there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** Don't, don't let them know we're here.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** They might touch doctor.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** It's not good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:00]** Just take a five minute rest.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:03]** You may have 10 minute rest while we're bumping along.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:03]** Yeah.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:06]** I think you can do it.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:07]** Yeah.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** You know, it's been a long time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:12]** Are we going to have to do piling checks over these terrains?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:18]** Well, you should see in your notes, and if you don't in your journal, you should see... Oh, no, no.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:22]** If you double-click on the vehicle, you should see... That says survivors.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:25]** You should see the speed.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:27]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:38]** And it's typically 75 miles an hour, but since it's such tough terrain, it's, it's trackless.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:41]** So it's about half speed.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:48]** You can go about 35 miles an hour with active, you know, staying active, focusing on driving, trying to move forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:49]** Cool.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** So long drive.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** It's a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** I mean, it's a full day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:55]** I wonder if we should stop halfway.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:55]** Okay.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:59]** And then take our rest then.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** And then continue.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** Because I don't want to be spent.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** That makes sense.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:07]** When we go to embark on inside the base.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** The base.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:12]** That is a good point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:16]** So maybe you guys start.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** You head north.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** Start turning east.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** And southeast.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:22]** Okay.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:27]** Maybe as you're looking, you can pull up a few facts about Veros.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:36]** Veros is a dense, thick atmosphere moon with normal gravity, with extreme heat.

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:46]** So your environmental protections, as we've discussed, will protect you, but you are at the edge of the environmental protections, up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:50]** If you do not have them on when you step outside, a lot of bad things happen.

**[00:49:50 - 00:49:54]** Because you're breathing in lethal fire damage, which would not be good.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:56]** Do we need to step outside to do a long rest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:57]** Can't we just sleep in the car?

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:59]** Is that a thing we can do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:59 - 00:49:59]** Right.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:02]** So in the car, you're fine.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** You can switch off the car.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** You can sleep.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:06]** You can do what you need to do.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:11]** But just know that also stepping outside, the thick atmosphere itself...

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:40]** you need to make some fortitude saves because it's just it's so dense it's good to know because treacherous planet we might want to you know what we might do so it's a good thing right you're good in environmental protections just remember that you have as many per hour as uh it lasts for a number of days equal to the item level that's what i was thinking so on hero lab make sure you check see where your item level is and that's how many days you have and it's typically expended in one hour conditions


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:40 - 00:51:03]** got two days two days so i mean you can step out burn an hour or two you're fine you're good if you need to terrible place not sure i'd want to but it seems like i'm driving through uh a wasteland wasteland so it's been


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:03 - 00:51:07]** At 30 minutes or so, you're talking, you're discussing, you're trying to figure out what to do.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** And you course correct.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:11]** You say, let's check out Terrapin first.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:13]** Let's see.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:18]** I'm going to start moving you guys on the map a little bit.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:22]** I can definitely picture, like you're saying, Will, the F-Zero still now.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** Even as you have a direction ready.

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:29]** Let me even rotate this a little bit further if I can.

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:32]** Is there anything that you guys are saying to each other?

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:36]** Is there anything more that you're thinking to each other as you're starting to drive?

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** Because now the highway syndrome...

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:41]** locked in, setting in.

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:47]** You're watching these jets of lava shoot up around you, going up and down.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:49]** It's not a smooth ride.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** You're not just chilling.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:54]** You're going in craters, avoiding turning large rocks.

**[00:51:54 - 00:52:02]** There's the occasional earthquake and you feel like the repulsors of the police cruiser not have a stable surface to push against.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:04]** So you're also pushing back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** What kind of range is this vehicle at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** Oh, for like the battery?

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:10]** Yeah.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:11]** Good question.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:16]** You're pretty sure that you can make it there and you don't need to charge.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:19]** But right now you've been topped up to full.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:28]** So you think that you could make it to 500 miles or so without it, but you'll have to see after a few hours, if the extreme temperatures it's been designed for it.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:32]** So it's a, it's a steward's commission vehicle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:43]** Are you able to get a look inside that computer thingamabob to see if there's anything about Terrapin stored in, in the files or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:44]** Uh, checking.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** Sure.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:47]** Uh, let's take a look.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:49]** Uh, he rolls a 33.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:50]** 33.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:57]** You see that the vehicle has a saved destination of Terrapin.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:00]** And while it hasn't been there, it is saved in the map.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:07]** Nothing more in there about size or number of people or how much it's staffed.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** There's not much in there about it.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:11]** Nothing really.

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** Security measures.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** Even in the steward's base.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** Anti-vehicle.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:22]** You still had to log into the main central computer to even get any information about Terrapin to begin with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:28]** And that's the deepest we can go, really, with computers in this vehicle regarding that.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:48]** yeah yeah nothing really any music as you can see it's just the map uh nothing else all right yeah we could play some f-zero music just really good i'll find some f-zero music dr okay he's got a um a reptoid audiobook


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:52]** that he's trying to just keep up on his Reptoid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:52 - 00:54:02]** To be clear, there is no Reptoid audiobook, but there are people who have made, you know, like folks who are like, I think this is what the Reptoid language would sound like if they're actually trying to go through it.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:07]** It's tough to say that... It's Joe Rogan interviewing people who've seen Reptoid.

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** Oh God, it's super conspiracy theory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** Like, you know, just like talking.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:12]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:18]** I don't know if, yeah, it makes sense that you might be like, all right, I'm going to start learning.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:21]** So maybe you're in the process of trying to listen to all these things now.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:25]** You're like, let me try and bone up on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:31]** Here's just like eyes wide open listening to the worst sound you can imagine.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:34]** It's like Dr. Oki listens.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:38]** Doctor, you could try it on me if you want to practice, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:39]** I got earphones.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** No worries.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:43]** You can bump whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** I just want to know my enemy.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:55]** I'll tell you what, but earlier today during work, I was listening to Joe Rogan's top 10 interviews about aliens.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** One of them was Post Malone.

**[00:54:57 - 00:55:00]** Post Malone and Joe Rogan go on this whole rant about aliens.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** It's ridiculous.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** Anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:03]** Amazing.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:03]** Amazing.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:05]** I love it.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:07]** You all are driving, cruising.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** Again, the highway syndrome is setting in.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** The realization that you are out on your own.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:15]** Like you are making your own decisions now.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:18]** There's no, there's nothing shepherding you forward.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:19]** That's true.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:22]** This is like our first really open world area, isn't it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:24]** Oh, the illusion of choice.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:24]** How I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** And it's a, well, that's true.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:28]** At least there's the illusion of it though.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:29]** It's not a hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:31]** It's a death filled hellscape.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** It's a, it's a hellscape.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:38]** See what, see what the consequences of our decisions brought us to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** You all decided to leave.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:40]** That's true.

**[00:55:40 - 00:56:00]** yeah let's let's do this as you're driving the sun is just starting to set you're definitely now 30 40 miles away from where to call space


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:02]** Oh, let me fast forward.

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:09]** I was going to stop, take a breather in one of these craters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:11]** Get out and breathe the fresh, noxious fumes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:15]** You mean with your environmental protectionism on?

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Yes, of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:21]** Stretch my tentacles a bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:26]** Dr. O'K, as you get out, something falls on you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** On the ground.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** Out of your driver's side door.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** His gigantic tentacle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:34]** Yeah.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:35]** His big member.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:42]** Ah, it's hot!

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:43]** It's a book.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** It's face down.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** Pick it up.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:47]** Of course.

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:48]** Turn it over.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:52]** I look at the spine.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** What is it?

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:57]** It's a pink and purple book.

**[00:56:57 - 00:57:00]** And on the spine, you can see that it's a medical text.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:02 - 00:57:03]** Reptoid physiology.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:04]** Wonder who was driving the vehicle.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:06]** Maybe was it Silverton?

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:08]** It was Dr. Nelson.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:09]** It's useless.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:10]** It's got to be noted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:11 - 00:57:13]** No way it's Silverton.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:17]** What, pray tell, is the subject matter of this medical textbook?

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:17]** Subject matter?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** Is this like Fallout?

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:20]** If you read the book, you get like a plus two.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:24]** That'd be awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:26]** The front cover of the book says...

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:30]** Gene Therapy, colon.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:36]** Design and Prospects of Barathu Subdermal Regeneration Methods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:39]** Interesting.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:44]** It's written... I wonder, does it have an audiobook version?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:48]** It's written by Dr. Navinci.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:51]** If you recall... Should I know that?

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:51]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** There was something...

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:58]** that, was it Shay showed to you?

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:04]** A picture of a file that Shay showed to you at the end of book two?

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:21]** I recall that there was a file that he showed that was, and I messaged you about it, and now I'm literally looking for it, where, what it said.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:25]** It said, ah, here we go.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:30]** on inducing Barathu genetic gain of function through gene modification.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:34]** Written by Boushdakis.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:35]** Da Vinci.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:37]** At all.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:43]** And there was a line that was crossing out Barathu on that.

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:45]** You've still got the picture on your data pad.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:49]** And the words Osharu were written above it.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:51]** And now this is a book...

**[00:58:52 - 00:58:54]** written by Dr. Navincy.

**[00:58:54 - 00:58:56]** By one of the, yeah, the second author.

**[00:58:57 - 00:58:59]** And you open, you're just like, oh, you just.

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:00]** Our first author.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:02]** The first author was Boushdakis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:04]** Oh, okay.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:16]** So the actual paper that, the file that I saw had Boushdakis as the initial author at all was the Navinsky?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:17 - 00:59:18]** Navincy.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** Yeah.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:19]** N-E.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** Navincy.


## Speaker_0

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:20]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:30]** And when you start to thumb through it, you just kind of look through it real quick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:37]** I mean, any learned scholar knows that you look through the table of contents and then the index.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:38]** And then you read the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** Yeah, and see what's there before.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** You look through the table of contents.

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:44]** You look through the index.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** It looks fascinating.

**[00:59:46 - 00:59:47]** And then as you're about to close it.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:47]** And the references.

**[00:59:47 - 00:59:49]** And the references.

**[00:59:49 - 01:00:03]** As you're about to close it, you see a little handwritten, hand-typed note that says, Rel, Dr. Rel Nodens, Rel, I'd be delighted to see your face in rose light anytime.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:05]** Nevinci.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[01:00:08 - 01:00:10]** Proof.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:16]** Proof that, like, she's a Reptoid or some kind of body snatcher, because there's no way that anyone would want to see Nodens.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** The Nodens we met.

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:19]** This must be someone else, for sure.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:20]** No way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:25]** Or she was abducted by the... Yeah, anyways.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:29]** Like, the real Nodens could still exist.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:31]** Or maybe not.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:32]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:35]** Did we figure out what Roselight was?

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:36]** Roselight is on Absalom Station?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:37]** No.

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:46]** Roselight, for the 15th time, Roselight is the main city of Leovara.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:53]** It's the main, like, big metropolis that's on the planet Leovara.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:54]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:55 - 01:01:00]** And that's where Reptoids are thought to be centralized?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:10]** That is where you saw that the stewards on Tirkala's base... That's where Charles Foster Kane lives.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:22]** The stewards on Tirkala's base were communing, talking, communicating, sorry, with Reptoid masters, let's say, on Roselae.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:36]** Rick19, you also remember that at the end of book two, when you first got on the Void Crier, you got a message that said, new target acquired.

**[01:01:37 - 01:01:41]** Leovara, Roselight, Mortifold.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:43]** Yeah, that's where I'm getting this confused on.

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:45]** And nobody else knew that except for the listener.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:46]** Thanks, John.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]** Drop it from your memory.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:51]** But that's my next bounty for the other players.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:54]** My next bounty is on Rosalind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:59]** So you all... I mean, Dr. K, what do you do in that situation?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:05]** I mean, I'm just going to keep this book and thumb through it when I have some time.

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:05]** Some more.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:09]** I mean, what do I learn from...

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:12]** The table of contents.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:12 - 01:02:18]** You learn that there is... There are a fair number.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:20]** Is it a collection of papers?

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:24]** Or is it an actual full... It's a bit of a lit review.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:29]** And a bit of an understanding on the current state of Baratheon diseases.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:30]** And specifically...

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:37]** regeneration methods that relate to some of the diseases through subdermal methods.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:44]** So there's a like the design and prospects are like, this is an understanding of what is out there.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:46]** This is a collection of papers.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:49]** This is a collection of papers about what's out there.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:54]** This is a collection of papers of like what the current state of like where we could be in 10 or 20 years with this research.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:59]** But it's pretty recent within the within the last year.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:00]** It's already published in a book.

**[01:03:01 - 01:03:02]** It seems odd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** Last two years.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:08]** We don't know how long we were on the... I mean, yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:09]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:10 - 01:03:12]** Maybe you all start driving again.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:14]** Starting the trek.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:14]** Yeah.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:34]** down well just a question for everyone does anybody need to take a long rest yeah should we take a long rest stopped before we get there well it's been now only an hour or so you're still 30 or 40 miles in i thought this was like a 500 mile trip yeah it is but i'm saying like


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:59]** you can we just hit the first exit on the highway it's not 25 miles an hour i think is what john's getting at i mean you you take a rest if you want but yeah i want to take a rest we could do it wouldn't really matter when we closer to halfway yeah okay well as let's say as you're driving you start the ground becomes a little more pockets of lava


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:03]** And you start to see off to the left and to the right.

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:06]** You start to see more lava.

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:22]** These pools that are getting larger and larger until you realize that these are little tributaries that are coming into some sort of large basin and a large lava river.

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:29]** And as you pull up to the shore of this fiery lava river,

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:59]** roiling in front of you you see off to the left walking in front of you you see these large creatures huge creatures literally just it's like a herd they have this intense face almost like a rhinoceros with this thick hide you can see babies with them and they are literally walking

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** In the lava.

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:04]** Walking your way.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:05]** And that's our game.

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** Back up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:07]** Reverse.

**[01:05:09 - 01:05:10]** All right.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:14]** Rick stands up and takes the glasses off.

**[01:05:14 - 01:05:17]** You're the freaking guy that hunts raptors.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:19]** Grabs Colin's head and turns it.

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:21]** Just Colin, look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:25]** Back to the fold.

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:28]** Welcome to Jurassic Park.
