## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:08]** Hey y'all, it is your thrice-deceased player and GM, John Swan, coming at you at the top of the app with a little Will Save update.

**[00:00:09 - 00:00:14]** We are very happy with everything that's gone on with Will Save over the past two years.

**[00:00:14 - 00:00:18]** Restarting Threefold, Old Gods, Gen Con, and Coffee, Merch, everything else.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:25]** You all have been fantastic and wonderful, and honestly, we're very proud, but also a little tired.

**[00:00:25 - 00:00:29]** So we are going to be taking a break from this episode through the end of 2024.

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:35]** Give us some time to recharge, get everything set up for 2025.

**[00:00:35 - 00:00:41]** Come back in, hitting you at the top of 2025 in January with some awesome content.

**[00:00:41 - 00:00:44]** So, that being said, we are still going to be around on Discord.

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:45]** You can still reach out to us.

**[00:00:45 - 00:00:49]** In fact, I hope to see you on Discord if you are not already there.

**[00:00:50 - 00:00:59]** And we are so thankful for you, as always, for being the awesome, incredible supporters that you are that allow us to be able to tell these stories in the first place.

**[00:00:59 - 00:01:00]** So, we hope that you understand.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:05]** We're very sorry to not be hitting your We'll Save Wednesdays as we like to do every week.

**[00:01:05 - 00:01:10]** But I think it's the healthy decision for us in order to take a step back just for a few weeks.

**[00:01:11 - 00:01:12]** And then we'll see you in 2025.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:17]** With that, I want to wish you the most wonderful of holiday seasons.

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:23]** And I hope that it is filled with the warmth and the light and the happiness that allows you to close out your year.

**[00:01:24 - 00:01:29]** So then that way, when the first We'll Save Wednesday of 2025 hits, you are ready to go.

**[00:01:29 - 00:01:30]** We love you.

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** Thank you for being at the table.

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:33]** And see you in 2025.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:35 - 00:01:38]** Hello, family.

**[00:01:38 - 00:01:42]** Gather round and let me tell you all a tale that'll chill you to the bone.

**[00:01:43 - 00:01:50]** Deep in the heart of the Appalachian wilderness, among the hollows and the cricks, we find four brave souls whose tale has yet to be told.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:54]** And these mountains hold more to be dreaded than you can ever shake a stick at.

**[00:01:54 - 00:02:24]** pulling the bounty from these here mines leaves a dead ode and beneath these mountains ancient eldritch beings lie imprisoned their presence a dark whisper in the wind hanks and boogers lie in wait for anyone down on their luck or just right for the picking in these woods the mountain's secrets are darker than the blackest night welcome to won't save where the only certainty is the mountain's grip as unyielding as the fear it instills

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** Well, hello there, family.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:41]** I am your relieved GM, Vinny Rodriguez, here with Will Garrett, John Swan, Heath Parker, and Kelly Gilliam.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** And we are won't save.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:46]** I guess we were won't save because we did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** Won't have been saved.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** Yeah, won't have been saved.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:52]** Were we saved?

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** Did we save the won't?

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:55]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:56]** We did.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:59]** We defeated the Godskin Apostle or whatever that was.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:01]** Stay tuned to find out.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** Julius died, though.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:02]** Spoiler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:07]** You guys should be listening to this more than once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]** Yeah, more than once.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** If you're listening to this, this is Plot Armor.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** And it contains many a spoiler.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Yeah.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:36]** yes we're gonna in this episode dive into all of the questions and hopefully answer all of them because i don't like the precedent that's been set that there are questions that remain unanswered after blood armor um yeah that feels point i mean i can't answer the questions that are going to come in a later book that you're going to play

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** Fair.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:44]** I might leave one or two questions unanswered, but this episode will definitely have spoilers for our run of Old Gods of Appalachia.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:48]** So if you haven't listened to that, run back on to episode one.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** It's only eight episodes long.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:57]** It's a nice jaunt through the woods with these four characters and a handful of possums.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** Who are we screwing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:59 - 00:03:59]** Everyone.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:04]** Because everyone was like, it's for sure going to be 13 episodes or something.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** I remember at least 13.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:07]** Some people were like 26.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:08]** Yeah.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** Everyone didn't believe us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:13]** We really proved the haters wrong this one.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** We did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:19]** We proved them wrong and ourselves wrong because I also thought it was going to be way longer than this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:21]** I had, I had four to six in my head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** I had 10, I think.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** Yeah.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:24]** I don't know what I had.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:24]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:25]** Yeah.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** That, that original four to six wasn't including plot armor.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:30]** So I still hold to like, I was pretty close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:34]** And you're the, you have the best record so far, man.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:36]** I mean, everyone else takes twice as long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:38]** That's pretty good for a one shot for you guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:39]** Yeah.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:44]** Thanks, Heath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:47]** Although, maybe Nano Adventure was nice and tight.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** Nano Adventure was tight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** That was pretty tight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:54]** That was 15 episodes plus a part.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** Are we getting better at this?

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:58]** Maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:58 - 00:04:59]** I don't know.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** Does practice make better?

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:03]** Yes.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:08]** Does releasing over 200 hours of content make you better at knowing?

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** How do I make it tighter?

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** Maybe, yeah.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:11]** Could be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:13]** My first question, Vinny.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:15]** This is my first question.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** We haven't even started.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:21]** Did you gut a big chunk of the story because we were taking too long to speed us up?

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:23]** I will gut any section.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** Look at that guilty face.

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:25]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:29]** I have a big old smile because I didn't cut out anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** Okay.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:30]** All right.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:31]** Wow.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** There was no N plus one.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** Yeah.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:36]** Ghosts.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** Ghosts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:38]** Yeah.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:39]** Cairns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:48]** Before we hop into the plot armor, we just got through spooky season.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** What'd you guys do?

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** How was it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:53]** I dressed up as the dude.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:56]** Yeah, that for sure happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** From The Big Lebowski?

**[00:05:58 - 00:05:59]** Yeah.

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:01]** I've not seen The Big Lebowski.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:01]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** You've not seen it?

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:03]** I haven't seen it either.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:06]** I'm getting ridiculed left and right because I've never seen it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Yeah, that's fair.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:07]** It's your loss.

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:12]** That's the appropriate reaction when somebody has money.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** You've seen it streaming for free now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:16]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** And that's... Wherever you find your movies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:21]** I think it's on multiple platforms, actually.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:21]** It's one of those.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** I mean, it's old now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** The big Lebowski.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:27]** But Will for sure is the dude.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:29]** Even I know that and I haven't seen that movie.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** I know this.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** What?

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:34]** I've seen like scenes and that's Will for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:38]** It is currently available in 4K on Prime.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:43]** Kelly and Benny, you need to watch it within the next 24 hours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** Yeah, Kelly, we have nine days.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:47]** So, yeah.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** Until it leaves Prime.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:49]** Oh, really?

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** It's a John Goodman character.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:51]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:52]** That's unfortunate.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** You should watch it.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:53]** Yeah.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:55]** And if you don't watch it, I will know.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:57]** The John Goodman character is Walter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:57 - 00:06:58]** Walter Sochek.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** Yeah, sweet.

**[00:06:59 - 00:06:59]** Sochek.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** Sochek.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:01]** How long has this been Walter?

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** I feel a little...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:32]** you're lebowski i'm the dude that's what you call me which is funny because like growing up john's parents always just just like yeah the dude like you you have for for decades just been the dude my niece and nephews call me the dude but i don't i'm not truly the dude yeah i just have a chill attitude towards a lot of things you don't drink white russians though i don't i don't


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:37]** And I feel like that's part of the ensemble, being the proper dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** That's a prerequisite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:44]** Yeah, if you're going to be the dude for Halloween, you have to drink White Russians the whole time.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:44]** The whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** I mean, that's just like trick or treat.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** And talk about your rug and how it tied the room together.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:55]** I'm just going to look up with a regular White Russian.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:58]** It's just vodka and milk, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:06]** Back when I worked at a classroom that I worked in where we taught kids at the time.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:08]** I like a sombrero.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:12]** This is probably not a good thing, but all the teachers would... I didn't, I should say.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:18]** But everyone else, like, you know, down to these, like, right before they would teach a class, like, every time.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** It was really messed up.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:20]** They were pounding white portions?

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:22]** But I didn't, because I didn't know what it was.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** Yeah.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:24]** So...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:24]** All right.

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** Weird.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** That's one way to go to work.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** Yeah.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** As a teacher, I'm not doing that.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:32]** Agreed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** I think it was a good idea.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:41]** It should be noted that since the abolition of prohibition, you're allowed to have two alcoholic beverages during a lunch shift.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** And you know what?

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:49]** Yesterday I had a lunch with a boss and

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:55]** And it was one of those where they have like the lunch, like four course little things that come out, you know?

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** And he just said, he was like, I'm always a big fan of a power lunch.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:02]** So the five of us got some beers and had like a little four course lunch.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:06]** And I was like, wow, I, I get it.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** I get it.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** It's a good feeling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:14]** That is one of my favorite things about working from home.

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:16]** This feels like a Real Men of Genius moment.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:20]** Here's to you, inventor of the opaque water bottle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:22]** Real Men of Genius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:25]** Opaque water bottle manufacturer.

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:26]** You saw our needs.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:31]** You've hidden so many beverages from plain sight, it's uncanny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:36]** You've hidden so many beverages from plain sight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:43]** My favorite one of those was, here's to you, Mr. Professional Wrestling Costume Designer.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:50]** You're not afraid to put 400-pound men in spandex.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:51 - 00:09:53]** I love it.

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:55]** Spectacular.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:04]** The later the meeting gets, the more likely it is that there may or may not be an adult beverage in there.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:11]** Some days you win, some days the database wins, and it's five o'clock somewhere.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:16]** No judgment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:24]** I mean, I feel like I should point out if you're hiding alcohol from plain sight and also drinking alone,

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:26]** You may have a problem.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** So seek help.

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:30]** If that's you at home listener.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:30 - 00:10:31]** Yeah.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:33]** For Halloween.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:34]** I did.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** Yeah, Halloween.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:39]** What did you do for that?

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:41]** I was on a plane, so I didn't celebrate.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:42]** So it's fine.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:42]** It's all good.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** I also was on a plane.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:46]** Did they give out candy at the airport?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** They did not.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** Oh, wow.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:56]** I was in Macau and they gave me some weird Macau knees candy.

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** I don't know what that is.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:58]** And it was good.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** Macau?

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:00]** Macau?

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:01]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:26]** yeah yeah i really like macau on 12 yeah that's what i was thinking um by the way i didn't do that drink thing that i mentioned earlier that wasn't me that was other people he said that i just want to be really clear all right this was not in america it's very clear if you reiterate it too many times then it comes off as guilt yeah yeah it's like oh now i think he's lying what are people from macau called


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** People, Kelly.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** Macanese.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** Macanese.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:34]** So I had some macaroons in Macau that was handed to me by a Macanese person.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** And it was delicious.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:37]** Were they macadamia mac?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:39]** Yes, they were.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** That got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:57]** macaroons macadamia macaroons from the macanese macallan macadamia macaw macaw handed it to me they had one on the leash and that was my story on halloween the machinations of this story are fascinating


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:02]** Keith, what about you?

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** Not much.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:09]** I did go to a party in Baton Rouge.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:10]** Nice.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:12]** Baton Rouge is in Florida?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** Louisiana.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Louisiana.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:19]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** I'm not from places like that.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** I don't know what I'm doing.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:24]** Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:28]** I went to many kinds of schools.

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:31]** I went to many schools.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** I rotated schools every three years.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** It was a joke.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** Some private, some public, some Christian private.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** I even did some homeschooling once.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:40]** It was weird.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:42]** It was the homeschooling that created that problem.

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:44]** Anyway, I didn't know where Matt Batmouge was.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:45]** I'm sorry.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:47]** You have a castle there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:50]** It's only the capital of Louisiana.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:54]** Oh, red stick.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:57]** Where is Milwaukee, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:00]** Kelly, what state is Wisconsin?

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** Okay, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Solid, solid.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** Yeah.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** There's probably a beer from there.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:08]** Like Coors or something is from there, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:11]** It's the part of the banter where you start quizzing Kelly on geography.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:14]** Yeah, what about St.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** Louis?

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** That's our next limited run show.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** It's just asking Kelly where places are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:19]** Missouri.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** Missouri.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:38]** and um he will then at the end be like i never drank any i didn't have any white russian during the course of the show i just want to be very clear that i did not drink any white russian


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:38 - 00:14:06]** the juxtaposition of like Kelly I will and Kelly travel a good bit I feel like Kelly might a little more and like just knowing how often you travel against like you having no idea where that's true love that I feel like I want to watch Kelly play geoguessr


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:12]** Uh, I'm pretty good at looking at street signs.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:12]** Yeah.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** Oh, there's a red Russian cocktail.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** That's what I'm drinking.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** That's why I never know on that, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** I'm also pretty good at looking at street signs.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** So game on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:21]** Yeah.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:21]** Yeah.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:25]** I will say when we were in Scotland, that was one of the most jarring things.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:32]** Like you don't, you don't notice when you're in a different country that you have to look not where you're used to looking for street signs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:35]** The orientation is different.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:35]** Yeah.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:36]** The size of buildings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:37]** Right.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:41]** I'm looking for poles or near the lights or something.

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:44]** Thank God for Google Maps.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:46]** Otherwise, I'd have been lost as a ball in high heat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:46 - 00:14:47]** Same.

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:53]** I went to London for a month and the last three or four days of that went to Edinburgh.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:58]** If I had not had a phone and Google Maps, I don't know what I would have done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:05]** Scotland outside of those, outside of Edinburgh and Glasgow and stuff like that is just tons of sheep and rolling hills everywhere.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:07]** Yeah, we did that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:12]** They put street signs on the sheep too, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:13]** The streets are constantly moving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:16]** That place is a nightmare for Google Maps.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:21]** Pretty sure I saw that next to the lock I was visiting.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** Yeah, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:26]** No, I went for a study abroad program for like a month.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:29]** And we spent like, you know, most of three weeks in London.

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:33]** We had like a weekend where you were encouraged to travel and stuff.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:35]** And then the last...

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:38]** Almost week was Edinburgh before we went home.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:48]** But I was in the one class that we went to Edinburgh like two days later than everyone else because we stopped in like super rural Scotland.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:50]** I was in an English class.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:55]** So some of it was like locations that were in books and stuff.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:58]** But I was miserable because it was like nothing there.

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:02]** It's just walking around a little village and looking at sheep for like two days.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** Yeah.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:29]** and i was so pissed off because all my friends that were on the trip had gone to edinburgh and were like partying and having a great time i was i was not happy with those sheep it's not that it was sheep's fault you know yeah it feels like it's very beautiful but there is not so much to do when you're just going to the hills and stuff well it's like i grew up in that dude like i live in rural mississippi like okay this is scottish mississippi where i'm at right now i don't want to be here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:30]** I think that's the whole.

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:33]** You got to learn those lessons somehow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:33 - 00:16:35]** And what's the capital of Mississippi, Kelly?

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** Jackson.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:38]** Dang it.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:39]** I didn't know we were playing the Kelly game.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:40]** I'm sorry.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:41]** I was just trying to get Kelly off guard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:42]** You know what I'm saying?

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:43]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** I've never been to the south.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:49]** I went to Tampa and Sarasota, and that's where I've been.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:51]** It's the only southern place I've been to.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** Which might arguably is not the South, right, Florida?

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:54]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:55]** Florida's the South for sure.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:58]** I would not call Tampa or Kissimmee the South.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:58 - 00:16:59]** Yeah.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:01]** I mean, they're absolutely in the South.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:07]** They are technically in the South, which is not the best kind of South.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:10]** The real South, I would argue, is correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:13]** Is it just like the fake South?


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:13]** I realized...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:22]** I mean, Miami's in the South, but when you think of Miami, you don't think of country music and pickup trucks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:26]** I mean, look, I feel like you're getting on a weird high horse about Florida.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:30]** You have three football teams in the NFL, and you have multiple NASCAR tracks.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:32]** You're in the fucking South, dude.

**[00:17:32 - 00:17:33]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:33]** I'll take it.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** That means I've been to the South.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:36]** By that definition, so is New York.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:39]** LA has a lot of teams.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:41]** I don't see a lot of teams.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:43]** How many race tracks does New York have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:43 - 00:17:45]** New York has two teams.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:47]** I think they have a couple of tracks.

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:48]** They have Pocono.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:48 - 00:17:49]** They have Watkins Glen.

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:50]** Don't they have Pocono?

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:53]** Or is that Pennsylvania?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** That's Pennsylvania, I think.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** Or is that just New Jersey?

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:56]** I'm sorry, South.

**[00:17:56 - 00:18:00]** I appreciate things that you do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** I'm still on Benny's side, though.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** Like, just...

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:08]** Orlando does not feel like a southern city to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:13]** Orlando is basically a company town ran by Disney.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:13]** Right.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:14]** Right.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:24]** Well, they're kind of like Austin and Texas where they're like surrounded by the south and are kind of a buoy in the sea, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:24]** Yes.

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** I'll give you that.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** Yeah, I will agree with that.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** I actually really want to go to Austin.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:31]** I've never been, but it's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:32]** We should go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:35]** I've never spent a significant amount of time in Texas.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:41]** I've driven through it multiple times, but I've never like gone for a trip to Texas for that matter.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:45]** I realized the other day I was like, Ooh, I feel particularly Southern.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:49]** I've traveled, you know, to a decent amount of states.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:50]** I lived in California for like a year.

**[00:18:51 - 00:19:09]** But other than California, which is west, not north, like I haven't really, other than airports, been to north of the Mason-Dixon line in America, except for we went to, is Indianapolis above the Mason-Dixon?

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:10]** I believe so.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:11]** I think it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** Okay.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:22]** It's two conventions I've gone to in the last two years where, like, my first time's going above the Mason-Dixon other than, like, New York's airports, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:26]** Yeah, I feel transiting doesn't necessarily count, so that makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:28]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:29]** I didn't see any of New York.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:31]** I was in an airport the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:38]** I would encourage you to take 95 or make your way up into New England and see what it's all about, man.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:38]** Yeah.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:39]** Cool.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** I would like to.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:40]** Great.

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:41]** Easy to drive through.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:42]** It's beautiful.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** Maine, New Hampshire.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:46]** Maine is vacation land.

**[00:19:46 - 00:19:47]** Maine's fucking great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** That's the place I've been to a lot is the Northeast.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:53]** And New Hampshire is the live free or die state.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:56]** I think anyone could agree with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:05]** What comedian was it that was talking about the state mottos and how the further east they are, the more hardcore they are?

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** It was Ronnie Chang.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:13]** The further west you go, the more they just phoned it in.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:18]** Texas' state motto, their official state motto is friendship.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** Just the word friendship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:20]** What?

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:21]** Friendship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:21]** Yeah.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:22]** Yeah.

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:25]** And you would think it would be all these hardcore crazy Texas things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** It's not.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:29]** It's friendship, but the way they say friendship at the end of a Mortal Kombat match.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** The eye is shaped like a gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** Yeah, that's what it is.

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:38]** So it's kind of similar to the under the table.

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:40]** Logo with the guns in the background.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** Yeah.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:41]** Yeah.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:42]** Yeah.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:49]** What I like about Virginia is that at first I thought Virginia's state motto was Virginia is for lovers.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:52]** That is not the motto.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:54]** Six Semper Tyrannis, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:57]** Six Semper Tyrannis or thus always Virginia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:56 - 00:21:24]** to tyrants so it's like at first i thought it didn't fit the mold but no it's like their flag is also like just as hardcore i think is i think it's i have to double check but i think it's somebody actually killing a tyrant yeah yeah it's it's someone standing on a tyrant yeah it's pretty intense that's i love that speaking of upending tyrants should we dive in oh

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:26]** Did we do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:27]** Did we upend the Tyra?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** Did we?

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:28]** Yeah.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:31]** I thought we were going to talk about cosmic horror.

**[00:21:31 - 00:21:32]** Oh.

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:43]** But I guess we blew through that banter topic with Kelly's miraculous and amazing capital geography knowledge.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** Sensibilities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** Yeah.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** Kelly, what's the capital of?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:49]** He's my number one pick for my quiz team.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:50]** Virginia.

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** Virginia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:18]** I have been to Virginia and Maryland.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:22]** But also, it was previously Williamsburg, I think.

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** But it moved.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:25]** Way back when.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:26]** Too many tyrants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:52]** no i think it flooded annapolis isn't no that's maryland yeah i know but i had no idea that it was annapolis which i guess big surprise but that did surprise me probably so i've never heard of that city all right whatever i'm tired of this i don't want to keep revealing how little i know it's not good it's over so many would you like to talk about cosmic horrors or would you like to talk about cosmic horrors in old gods


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:55]** I think we talk about cosmic horrors and old gods.

**[00:22:55 - 00:23:00]** We save cosmic horrors for the next old gods banter, if there is one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:02]** I had a really good one, too.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:05]** It was good banter fodder.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** Oh, well.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:09]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:13]** Put it in the future episode banter bank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:16]** I'm adding it to my potential future notes.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** And now no one will ever know.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:21]** No.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:24]** Some ideas just stay in the vault.

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:26]** That's how these cookies crumble.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:33]** You can guess, and I'll maybe answer yes or no, posting a question in our Discord.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:37]** What is Will's favorite cosmic horror movie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:39]** That's a really good question.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:45]** I would like to know that personally, so I'll have to ask you on our Discord so everyone can find out.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:47]** I'm actually trying to dive into more.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:32]** Yeah.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:55]** cool let's dive in so we first meet our characters uh we do a little bit of getting to know each other and then we find them at 12 years old in you know uh podunk uh pennsylvania city called dismal back in 1901 that's right uh we put together a fort in the woods and

**[00:24:56 - 00:25:01]** That fort has some trinkets and some personal effects.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:05]** Will, talk to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:13]** I just wanted to mention before we got too far into it that STF's domain registration is held in Mississippi.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** There you go.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:17]** So I would say the capital is what again?

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:19]** Mississippi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:19]** What's the capital?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:22]** Mississippi.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:26]** Tom Sawyer's Island, Mississippi.

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:28]** I can't remember, man.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:32]** Sorry, Mississippi.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** I didn't sleep last night.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** I slept like 30 minutes.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:36]** I can't remember anything anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:39]** You don't have to apologize to the entire state of Mississippi.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:41]** The entire nation forgets us.

**[00:25:41 - 00:25:45]** We're pretty used to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:47]** Such a grand river.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:48]** The Nile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** The River Nile.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:57]** Right next to Mississippi.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:00]** Y'all got them big triangle things.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:09]** Big triangle things.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:34]** cool so we're 12 years old we're in dismal pennsylvania it's an old mining town um we build this fort together with you know stolen trinkets and cole's skipping stone um that that part i really just wanted to like thank you guys for going there because that was all improv that was all off the cuff oh really yeah

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:35]** None of that was prepared.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:39]** Like, the fort in the woods.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:47]** Like, I knew we were going there, but I had no idea how you all would decorate or, you know, in Kelly's case, construct the fort.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:51]** Wait, so.

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** Thanks, guys.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** Yeah.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** Does the book say that there's a fort that we go to?

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:57]** Yeah.

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:57]** Okay, got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** Yeah, that is like your safe haven.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** Got it.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:06]** I just, I didn't know how you guys were going to decorate it.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:09]** So like that, the skipping stone was a nice touch.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:15]** Ira's kleptomaniacal tendencies really paid off there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:30]** Um, and out of the blue, this rabbit shaped stone explodes and Julius dies for the first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:32]** Wild for the first time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:35]** And that's in the book?

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** Yes.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** That I die.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:37]** That's part of it.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:38]** That is as written.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:39]** Those are rookie numbers.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:41]** You need to pump those up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:42]** Yeah, I got to die at least three more times.

**[00:27:42 - 00:27:43]** Question.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:49]** In your explanation for that, you said something about...

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:53]** We all felt like we were somewhere else.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:58]** Was that just embellishment or were you referencing something?

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:08]** Cause I think later I was trying to go through notes of things that happened and just thinking like, what would Julius be thinking about with these moments and trying to recollect and find like conversation topics.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:09]** And that was one of them was like,

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:13]** where did we go in that moment?

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:14]** Right.

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:16]** Like what, what happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:34]** Was it just rabbit, rabbit, Cairo, Mississippi, the, uh, I'm, I'm actually going back to the, like, if you've ever GM, do you know that there's, there's boxed text in the manual for you to read?

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** And so it's kind of boxed text.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** Um,

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:40]** That is part of the box text.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:54]** My headcanon is that it pushed you forward in time or through consciousness where you could see through either the eyes of your future self or one of your ancestors.

**[00:28:55 - 00:29:05]** Because this is kind of the birthplace for any supernatural powers you might have had as an adult.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:32]** is this experience with the rabbit rabbit statue got it because the statue like the statue itself wasn't rabbit rabbit per se but like what you notice as we come back 20 years later after you've like when we get to the end rabbit rabbit is dying that statue was the artifact that gave rabbit rabbit however many lives it had

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:37]** And the bomb exploding was Rabbit Rabbit using one of his lives.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:39]** So Rabbit Rabbit's a dick, right?

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:44]** I mean, I know that we helped him save some stuff.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:44]** That's great.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:47]** But he's also kind of a dick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:53]** Rabbit Rabbit, I would categorize Rabbit Rabbit as chaotic...

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** chaotic, good light.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:58]** Like he's, he's, he's somewhere between like neutral and good.

**[00:29:59 - 00:29:59]** Oh, okay.

**[00:29:59 - 00:29:59]** Okay.

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:02]** Cause like he, he's, he's neutral in that.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:04]** Like he's just a trickster God.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:14]** Um, but also like sees Julius dead on the ground and sees you kids as suffering is, has taken a liking to you.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:18]** Um, which is why he's let you stay in his like safe Haven.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** Hmm.

**[00:30:20 - 00:30:30]** Um, and so like he, he is altruistic in those ways, but even in that, like he made you, he didn't do that for free.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:30]** Right.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:33]** You still had to do something for him in return.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:37]** So he's somewhere between chaotic, good and chaotic, neutral.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:59]** okay okay yeah he's not a chaotic oh no kevin's not kevin's chaotic evil i feel that's what i think about it or he's chaotic yeah he's chaotic brick 19 sure is um i was like kevin as a dude it's chaotic oh yes yeah yeah you'll see yeah i think you're a little too close to the project


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:19]** um so julius dies rabbit rabbit shows up and says you know hey i'm i like you kids uh you want to bring him back to life or nah you know they're like you say yes because we're good friends bet yeah and magically julius is back

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:28]** And you all remember him dead, but you know, he, he comes back to life and everyone goes their separate ways.

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:34]** Like you still exist in similar circles, I guess, but you're not really nearly as close friends as you were before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:38]** I did appreciate that we really leaned into that.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:54]** It did feel like when we actually started 20 years later, as we get on, it did feel like we had just kind of come back to being friends.

**[00:31:54 - 00:32:01]** And maybe that was a benefit to the fact that the four of us didn't have roleplay as these characters.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:03]** Really, as kids, we had a little bit.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:09]** But then we actually started to know each other and react to each other's histories and what's happened.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:11]** And that's what we were reacting to.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:14]** And so we didn't quite know, so we were figuring it out together.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:20]** To me, that felt actually really... That was very fun to feel like I was...

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:38]** like had been familiar with you with your character and then was getting reacquainted with your character now as a different person because you're 20 years older yeah um oh that that uh rabbit rabbit rhyme yeah dude was that box tech no

**[00:32:39 - 00:32:42]** Did you just get that off the dome?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** Yeah, that was original.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:44 - 00:32:45]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:47]** I was trying to breathe a little bit of life into it.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:51]** There's a lot there, and there's a lot that you guys fleshed out for sure.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:57]** But what does being a kid in 1901 feel like?

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:02]** So, I mean, I imagine a lot of oil lamps.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** Yeah, because it was 1901 when you were 12 years old.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:06]** Back in the aughts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:06 - 00:33:19]** yeah the odds yeah right that's before the great war i mean it's a big deal yeah before the great war it's probably yeah it's probably very optimistic i guess yeah i did feel it i did feel like you know sitting in a


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:48]** very dark room except for one little candle wick burning hearing this would absolutely be creepy so that was that was a nice touch yeah thank you ready uh cool so julius was alive and you come back 20 years later for his funeral when he died again of natural causes you know at 30 something as happens in the 19 aughts


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:49]** Practically 75.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** Right.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:51]** Yeah.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** Yeah.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:53]** Pushing 80.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:57]** Collecting your pensions and meeting for the funeral.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** What was that like?

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:01]** Pension in 19-0.

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** John, your character has now died twice.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:04]** Wait, what year was this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** I thought it was 1920s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:07]** Yeah, yeah, 1921.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:12]** Yeah, so the original... It was seven years and you would have had penicillin.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:12]** Duh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** Ha ha ha!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:40]** yeah what was your question uh john your character has now died twice and that was not something we had talked about in advance what's going through your mind at that point that i don't did did we end that episode with me coming back we did right because i walked through or no you know i think we ended it with you dying the second time


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:45]** Yeah, honestly, I genuinely thought that you were going to have me roll another character.

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** I was like, all right, cool.

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:54]** I breathed just enough life into Julius to be an anchor for some story point.

**[00:34:55 - 00:35:00]** And then now I will go on my merry way and create a new fucking character.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** Cool, great.

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** All right.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** I was just a sacrificial lamb.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** That's fine.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** First time was practice.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:06]** Yeah.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:10]** first death was practice and we didn't quite nail it.

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** Cause in the second time success, right?

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** Yeah.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:13]** I really died.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** But then I came back again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** Yeah.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:19]** As a ghost, which is that part of it?

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** That is part of it.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:29]** Um, I felt bad cause it's, it's written like this adventure has pre-generated characters because it's like

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:34]** It's designed to run in about an hour and a half, two hours.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:39]** It was the, you remember the demo we did at Gen Con this past year?

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:40]** Yeah.

**[00:35:40 - 00:36:06]** this adventure was the demo they did the year before so like it's designed to be you know pick up from scratch and you know play this handful of scenarios just go just go and so like as written the it's names one of the like pre-generated characters as the ghost which is part of the reason why i kept calling you the wrong name yeah that's fine it's all good


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** It all comes out in post.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** Yeah.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:10]** Yeah.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:12]** So yes, you were supposed to die twice and come back as a ghost.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:17]** Cause like the, the adventure is titled best.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:19]** Leave them old ghosts alone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:23]** Oh.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:23]** Yeah.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:25]** So we should have ditched Julius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:28]** Yeah, so we should have abandoned him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:32]** Yeah, I think in the beginning, just say no to your friend coming back, and then the adventure would have been over.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** Just been like, hey, rabbit.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** Yeah.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Cap.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:42]** We've had a good run with Julius.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Yeah.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:43]** He was all right.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** That's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** He was fine.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:48]** Dude owes me four pennies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:51 - 00:37:08]** yeah yeah i feel like that was the choose your own adventure version where if you decide to not do that then julius becomes controlled by the gm and haunts what if we did the players yeah what i mean what would have happened many it would have just been like all right like you would just roll with it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:12]** That is unexplored territory.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:14]** I'm really glad you guys chose to revive him.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:17]** That would have been it.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:19]** That is beyond the scope of this adventure.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:19]** Cool.

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:22]** We now meet another band of four friends.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** And one of them dies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:32]** You guys just need to save one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:48]** bull bard noah green and julio lestrange ira still ira i think

**[00:37:48 - 00:38:13]** yeah yep uh cool so we go to julius's funeral it's beautiful we somehow end up back at the fort like you don't remember how you got there you just kind of appear there and julius shows up as a ghost from the mist and along with rabbit rabbit who's like yo y'all owe me some work

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:28]** It tells you about what's happening upriver and what we need to do to prevent town from getting washed away.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:38]** And I make an offhanded remark that we're about to go traveling, that we can go back to the town to do some exploring.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:40]** And y'all were like, yes, let's do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** Because what do you expect?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:46]** And it was at that moment that I knew I f***ed up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:50]** Don't give us options.

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:52]** Well, you had said that you want to get supplies.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:53]** Yeah.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** Right?

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:55]** Yeah.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:56]** That was the whole thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:59]** You want to stock up before you leave town.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:22]** most of us anyway we're already carrying plenty of supplies yeah like you should be grateful that that shop interaction was not like the snake boy interaction from unknown treasures i mean i feel like you should be thinking on the positive side here you gave us an option we ran with it because we do that yeah because we just love to waste time dude yeah that was spectacular i need to remember this myself yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:26]** I will say that I really liked your NPCs and complications in town.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:29]** That was a really fun bit.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:35]** The bartender, the shopkeeper, and then the shopkeeper's husband coming in and confronting Cole.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:38]** That was cool.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** I remembered that, too.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:43]** I was like, your town NPCs are very, very good.

**[00:39:43 - 00:39:48]** I feel like you would be very good at just performing NPCs a lot.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:49]** You pull off an NPC well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:50]** That's good.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Yeah.

**[00:39:52 - 00:40:18]** i was worried it's one of those like every every gm article you ever read is like yeah keep a list of like 25 random names and simple facts and like you're gonna need them i was like i'm definitely not gonna need them this whole thing is on rails then you're like we go to the speakeasy i was like there's not a speakeasy now there is


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:20]** See, I think that's the best.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:25]** I get having maybe a short list of fun names or characteristics that you're like, oh, that's clever.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:29]** But I think it's so much more fun when you're like, oh, that's right.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** I just got to come up with it right now on the spot.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:34]** And I will do the first thing that comes into my head right now.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:35]** Whatever it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:40]** That's one of my favorite things is having to just pull something out.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:46]** Because it always, or at least most of the time, ends up being a stupid name that's really funny to everyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:46]** Always.

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:47]** Always.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:47 - 00:41:11]** yeah it's yeah just the oh what's their name just the expectation is so good oh yeah that that sorry that that unexpectedly happened in in one of our shows where we're uh in our 2e show we're like you know wanted people the law is looking for us and i just had to on the fly come up with with an alter ego and

**[00:41:11 - 00:41:17]** And now, like, that stupid character name I came up with, like, there are people that changed their Discord name to that.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:18]** You know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:19]** That's awesome.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:20]** That's great.

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:22]** That is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:23]** Bernard Leftwinkle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:30]** I kind of want to change my name to that.

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Bernard Leftwinkle.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:36]** Oh, man, the left is really, like, I like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:37]** It really ties the room together.

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:41]** Yeah, it does.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** Cool.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** So we go shopping.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:44]** We find out Ms.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:46]** Baker has a crush on Cole.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:50]** Cal Baker finds out Mrs. Baker has a crush on Cole.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:57]** And then we head over to the Whispering Blinds Mortuary where we meet Julius's dad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:05]** Can I just point out that I almost got in trouble because was it Zoa who was egging me on?

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:07]** No, it was Iroh.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:07]** Iroh?

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** It was Iroh for sure.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:09]** That was fun.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** That was fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:11]** 100%.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:12]** 100% Iroh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:19]** I played it as though Iroh was trying to do a good thing, but just is such a little weasel doesn't know how, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:22]** It was quite fun.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:23]** Yeah, it was.


## Speaker_0

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:50]** yeah that that that that and the bartender scene where like when we really started to i feel like see our characters like in an interaction come to life that i liked i felt bad a little bit good good good no good i was gonna say i felt bad a little bit because like i kept forgetting that you were a ghost and these people weren't supposed to be able to see you and but like being able to recover me because he kept talking yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:54]** Adapt, improvise, overcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:55]** Cool.

**[00:42:55 - 00:43:14]** So we make it to the Whispering Pines where we meet Julius's dad, Cooper, who gives you some interesting backstory on how the Whispering Pines mortuary has passed down through the family.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** Yeah.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:22]** why it's set up the way it is, how the water banner kind of fits into some of this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** And that was all you, right?

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:33]** Because I feel like I gave you too much information about, like, oh, what about this and this and this for Julius?

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** And then you, like, tied it in.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:42]** I felt like it was really well because you tied it into the threat that would be part of the dam, you know?

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** Yeah.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:48]** Besides taking out the town of Langley, also would release this elder chore.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** Yeah.

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** So I thought that was really clever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:50 - 00:44:16]** i appreciated that the like having that extra backstory tidbit to tie in was uh really helpful because like that the additional elder tour is as written but like i was kicking around how do i tie that into like how do i make that important to you guys um and so i think it it being the thing that their grandfather had subserviently fed

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:35]** and then um like also how do i give the watermander credibility because at this point it's just like a rabbit has said go find this yeah pixie lady in the woods yeah i i mean at least for for me that definitely all worked that like fed into the mission yeah that we had in front of us


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:35 - 00:45:02]** um so we wrap up at the whispering pines we get the information we needed and head through the woods to fight the first fight of the game uh let's talk about combat in old gods how'd you guys feel about it it's fun yeah it was simple it was a little uh jarring at first not to know the range yeah and in a definite way but it flowed pretty nice


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:07]** I personally found it a little... It left me a little wanting.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:08]** I like the cyphers.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:09]** I think they're very cool.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:19]** But being used to a more tactical combat style, I just found myself like, I'm not sure what I need to be doing a lot of the time.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:25]** Also, some of that is probably playing a character who has almost zero combat capability.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** So, I don't know.

**[00:45:28 - 00:45:28]** I...

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:34]** don't hate it, but I don't... I wanted more out of it, you know?

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:38]** But getting to use the ciphers was like the part that I did like, you know?

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:44]** I think one time I threw a knife and hit something, you know?

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** But I mean, that's like...

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:51]** That's one of those, is it a feature or a bug conversation that's like, well, what is your approach?

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:57]** Because it's a more rules-like game, which allows for more flexibility and all that stuff.

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** So I see the pros.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:02]** I'm just leaning more towards a more tactical game.

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Not trying to dunk on it.

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** Just my preference.


## Speaker_0

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:20]** I think it was Will or Heath, you said at the end of that first combat that you would have liked to roll for damage, that the fixed damage was, you know, a bit of a bummer.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:31]** Like, definitely leaves you wanting, because then it's like, well, yes, you know what's going to happen, which is great, but also I think adding in die might then mean you have to rebalance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:32]** You can add die with ciphers, though.

**[00:46:32 - 00:46:34]** I don't think...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:55]** you can add i got to do that but i like having kind of a mix yeah i feel like like it's just a bigger difference of the game system itself like starfinder pathfinder dnd are all combat centric game systems right but this is not

**[00:46:55 - 00:47:10]** very much that's fair um you know you're awarded xp not for combat at all like it's all for role play and story development so like it it's it's there as a necessary guide for pushing the story along


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:41]** that's why I'm not trying to throw it under the bus I recognize it's a total game style difference I'm just more accustomed to the other game style I will agree there's some chess that I think would have been nice to play with these characters and I think if I was to run it again I might adopt more of a streamlined but a little bit more robust combat mechanic


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:46]** There was also some stuff that... Oh, sorry, we keep doing this.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:54]** There was some stuff that was just like... I felt like it was hard to find, like, is there a damage for this?

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:56]** Is this usable in combat?

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:58]** You know, that I felt like wasn't very clear.

**[00:47:58 - 00:47:59]** Like...

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:04]** My big example I can go to is the cypher that let me turn into a bear.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:15]** You let me attack several times as the bear, but nowhere on the cypher or anything does it give you how much damage you're doing or if you can roll it as an attacker.

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:31]** Um, so that was like, just, I felt like the information I needed wasn't provided at least now granted, I didn't read all of the source books, you know, so there might be like a specific area for that in the source books, but like on the cipher themselves.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:32]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:51]** that information wasn't provided yeah and the the having read the the source manual uh quite a few of the the like rule guidelines it's just like do you want to try it if it if it works in the situation it works if it doesn't it doesn't like yeah

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:55]** you know, if you'd tried to attack a tree, you would have rolled it up and, and figured it out in the moment.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:59]** I think it's more of a, like, here's the tools, here's the pieces.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** What do you want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:00]** Yeah.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:05]** It's just, it's just such a different game philosophy.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:10]** It sounds like even in the way it's written into the book, it's so up to you.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:16]** And yeah, we're, we're so accustomed to a very rules heavy prescriptive system.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:17]** Yes.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** That allowing all this freedom.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:20]** Yeah.

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:25]** I can see how as a GM you're like, yep, I've GMed, but you've also GMed a different type of game.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:28]** It's not a D20 game in the same way.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:30]** Yeah.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:32]** Can I ask what the white things hit?

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:32]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** Go ahead.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:37]** what were the white things hit points?

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:46]** Cause that was the one thing that I, unfortunately I feel like now that I jam a lot, like I can't turn off is like, or when I can't turn off, it's a, it's a, it's a good thing.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** Cause it means that you're like locked into the game.

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:48]** Right.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:52]** But like wondering from your side, like what are the stats that you're seeing?

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** Like, what are you tracking?

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** Right.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Cause that's always a big thing.

**[00:49:55 - 00:50:03]** It's like how the players feel about how the combat's going might or might not align with how the combat technically is going as the GM, as you're seeing it.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:03]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:04]** So,

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:09]** So the white thing had 18 hit points.

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** Okay.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** The white thing was a difficulty six creature.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:36]** so when we talk about what you need to roll and difficulty levels so it's three times whatever the difficulty level is so it's attacks you would have to beat or meet an 18 or have some sort of asset that would move it up or down the difficulty track to not get hit or to hit the creature

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:40]** So I really appreciated that simplicity.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:52]** There was a few... I think I went a little bit light on it, because it technically gets three attacks per round, and I think I only used one or two.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:58]** But that being our first combat, I wanted to not... I didn't want to draw it out for too long.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:01]** I didn't want to try to kill one of the creatures...

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:20]** i wanted to get the first one under our belt and so i i did nerf the white thing a little bit just to be like okay this is how combat works this is a real like monster that you've seen and experienced before in this woods um but also like okay this is our this is all of our first time doing combat


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** I mean, that's fair.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** Yeah.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:34]** I felt like it was pretty, it was like, it was clear from the beginning that this combat or that this creature could hit us all every turn, whoever wanted to, it could hit you.

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:41]** So it was just like a matter of time before we would take somebody out, which feels a little bit more like call, uh, like, um, dealt the green.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:49]** Whenever we get around to that, like, it feels like it's kind of in it and inevitability that you're going to either die or take significant damage.

**[00:51:49 - 00:51:50]** Every comment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:50]** Yeah.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:58]** The weird part about that creature was it doesn't deal physical damage.

**[00:51:58 - 00:52:01]** After the fight, you notice that you don't have any wounds at all.

**[00:52:02 - 00:52:03]** It just attacks you in your mind.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:13]** And then if it does manage to kill you, you immediately gain all of the physical cuts and punctures.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:15]** And it like...

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:38]** basically vampire sucks all the blood out of you and so you're right you're left like a dry bag oh wow yeah that's neat it is neat um damn spoopy super spoopy i i had some ideas to that you would find like deer carcasses but they had no blood but i i felt like that would just believe at the point mm-hmm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:41]** You could have killed some of the possums.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:43]** We could have found possum carcasses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:47]** I didn't want to just off-screen murder the possums.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:49]** I feel like I would have started a revolt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:54]** You could have just killed me a third time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:54 - 00:53:02]** We find a ghost with all of his blood drained.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:22]** yep so you defeat the white thing and move right along to the raging river uh let me scroll down in my notes uh zoa we met clemmy how did you land on the allegheny dusky salamander she's a good girl


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** I like salamanders.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:29]** So I think I looked up salamanders in Appalachia.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:31]** Appalachia, that came up.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** Plus it had a long name.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:38]** You could have just stopped right there and that would have been a hilarious bit.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:40]** How'd you land on this?

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:42]** I like salamanders.

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** Period.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:47]** That is my response.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:48]** Yeah, true, true.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** The name was fun for me to say.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:57]** I enjoyed the name as other people did too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:58]** So it was a game.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:03]** Kelly, what is the national salamander of the United States?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:07]** It's the Allegheny Dusky Mountain Salamander, didn't you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:09]** Nailed it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:09]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:10]** That is not correct.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** A.K.A.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:16]** Clementine Nelizidarius.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:19]** That's the Latin name.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:22]** Clementine Nelizidarius.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** That's so many syllables.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:26]** Yeah.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:32]** Ira embeds his knife in this thing's nose, which Cole uses to just like

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:35]** RKO it right onto the ground.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:38]** The wombo combo.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:42]** That was a really nice combo.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:46]** I was thrilled when that happened.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:49]** It's a cool word with RKO.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:54]** I rode Cole's coattails all the way to success and enjoyment in that situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** Yeah, it was fun to come up with on the spot.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** I saw a knife.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** I figured, oh man.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:03]** This is going to be great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:10]** And it was, and we end the episode in between.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:11]** We discover that.

**[00:55:11 - 00:55:15]** So wants to meet a pup, Ellie pig, which doesn't ever actually happen.

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:17]** I don't think, I don't think it ever happened.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:17]** Yeah.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** Yeah.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** Part of your backstory.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:23]** There weren't really any like wild pigs got to die again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:25]** There was nothing really reward.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:27]** Yeah.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:29]** We'll get to Julius dying.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:33]** I want to unpack that a little bit, but that's, we've got a couple more episodes to get there.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:34]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:37]** I do want so to meet a popular big one day.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:37]** Yeah.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:43]** I did realize that after the, after the ending of last step, I was like, that didn't happen.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** No.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:46]** One just didn't walk into Zoe's path one day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:53]** That was, that is one of the, uh, open-ended plot strings that we can pull later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:55]** Hmm.

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:56]** Hmm.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:56]** Let's yeah.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:58]** Let's, let's touch on that later.


## Speaker_0

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:13]** I thought you were going to say that's one of the things the book suggests for continued adventures, specifically pot belly pig oriented plot threads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** Oh, man.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** We're walking through the forest.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:19]** A tree almost hits Zoa, which was just like.

**[00:56:20 - 00:56:47]** great dodge zoa um yeah but also like just trying to keep you guys on your toes like this this wood is not safe outside of your little haven that was facilitated by rabbit rabbit uh that was you right um yes yeah where we meet jesse coleman who immediately gets hit in the head with a wrench yeah that was fun um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:50]** Was that you or was that the book?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:53]** Uh, that was the, you, you are designed to meet Jesse at some point.

**[00:56:55 - 00:57:01]** Um, whether that is, uh, there were a couple of options to get from town to the watermander.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:06]** You could go along the road, you could go along the woods or you could take the train.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:11]** So like there were those three paths and drew to meet Jesse.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:12]** Yeah.

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:15]** I'd casually mentioned the train station, um, a couple of times.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:18]** I wasn't sure if you were going to take the train or not.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:27]** Um, and then the, um, so I was like, yeah, I don't know when you're going to meet him.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:30]** And I think I'd like to, uh, throw him in here.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:30]** So we did.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:38]** And you know, he wasn't necessarily supposed to be a moonshiner, but I thought it would be a nice tie into Cole's backstory.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:47]** If he was winning a rum runners and just literally running through the woods with a crate full of clinking, clanking contraband bottles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:51]** kind of reminds me of the lettuce guy from avatar.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:52]** Love my contraband.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** The lettuce guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:03]** I don't, my character, the, my cat, the cabbages guy, the guy who like was the founder of cabbage court, uh, later on.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:04]** Yeah.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** That guy's, that guy's funny.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** He's the NPC with the cabbages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:10]** I'll have to check that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:14]** And you've never seen the airbender that, and the vehicle basket.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:14]** Um,

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:19]** And so we were supposed to learn from Jesse just more about Langley, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** Yeah, from a different perspective.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:31]** So like Jesse, I don't remember if he's from Langley or he's just spent a lot of time there, but like the local sentiment isn't that this...

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:56]** river washing the town away is a foregone conclusion if the dam gets built but the mining company that's coming in to build it isn't necessarily the friendliest and so like people in town are torn because they want jobs but also they don't want like totalitarian regimes so yeah who does right right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:05]** I will say this is when it started to cement in my mind that we were going to go to Langley.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:11]** This is where I started to think, oh, okay, this is really important information for me to know when we get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:11]** Yeah.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:13]** Yeah.

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:17]** Um, and to reiterate how dangerous like the water was.

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:22]** So like the, the, the river itself was angry.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:26]** It was like throwing people from the dam to the river.

**[00:59:26 - 00:59:30]** And like, it seemed like he was attacking them.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:30]** Yeah.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:30]** Yeah.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:32]** Yeah.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:40]** So we get to the water and find it attacking your boat and Cletus and, you know, him going down with the vessel.


## Speaker_0

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:42 - 01:00:08]** yeah you guys missed out but then we saved water navigation skills yeah we wouldn't have to save them if that didn't happen but okay i was hoping that the possums throughout it would remain ambiguous as to whether they were real or not yeah because we talked about that at one point uh and i was just i i would love the idea that we finish it and it's like

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:11]** We just haven't really locked that in.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:17]** If everybody actually can see the possums, or if Zoa is a crazy old druid in the woods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** I understand that.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:20]** I get it.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:21]** I do.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:23]** But I really, really want it.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** I really wanted them.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:28]** For me, I needed them in my life.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:32]** You just wanted to go sleep at night.

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:34]** That would be a cool thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:38]** But it was unclear if they really were that skilled or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:38]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:38]** You know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:42]** I mean, you'll never know now, because a GM intrusion happened, in quotes.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:49]** And then, like, poor Cletus sank to the bottom before getting spat back up, or whoever say.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:50]** I can't remember how it happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:52]** I think you and I did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:53]** Yeah.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** Gotta save my boy.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:59]** Yeah, that was tough, because, like, I loved that.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]** I felt like the boat was a stroke of genius.

**[01:01:01 - 01:01:04]** Like, of course, Zoa has a boat powered by possums.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** That makes all the sense in the world.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]** Yeah, obviously.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:07]** Yeah.

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:10]** I mean, it's just like standard fare for the genre.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** Absolutely.

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:38]** but like the river would i knew the river would have never let that happen like she was so angry that like the boat wasn't gonna survive yeah yeah yeah joan river that's fair um she's a saucy one joe she is a saucy one saucy minks for the for the follow-up to this show if we ever do old gods again you should name it like uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:01:38 - 01:02:04]** midwest emo bands do like super long title and it's like uh classical uh classical appalachian possum boat stories is like the whole title yeah yeah they're my favorite marsupial i would love that i didn't know that pretty cool because there's a lot of good marsupials too so that's high praise it's very high praise with awesome right there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:10]** I do want a prequel in which we find out how Cletus played by

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:13]** Who was he played by?

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:14]** He was played by Liam Neeson.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:15]** Cletus Neeson.

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:16]** Yeah, Cletus Neeson.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:21]** How he came to this timeline, right?

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:25]** And was in Possum Witness Protection, or whatever it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:28 - 01:02:30]** Him and his particular set of skills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:37]** He rescued his possum daughter from a band of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:37 - 01:03:01]** ferrets uh gangster ferrets a gang of ferrets yeah yeah no pot belly pigs so then so then we can bring in the pot belly pig connection that's it that's it yeah yeah run run and buy a pot belly pigs kill them all yeah yeah that's it i just imagined the french government was pot belly pigs because i'd like that headcanon

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:09]** And we pick up episode five with everyone saving Cletus from drowning.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:12]** We get him back.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:13]** He's okay.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:14]** He's fine.

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** He hasn't died yet.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:20]** But the boat's at the bottom of the river, so we're going to have to fix that later.

**[01:03:22 - 01:03:31]** From there, you trek on to the Watermander's place to see the Rick Rolican good time of an attack river.

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:38]** who is super upset and asks you very specifically, why did you take her?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:39 - 01:03:40]** Yeah, we didn't respond to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:03:40 - 01:03:40]** Nope.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:42]** No, you didn't.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:44]** Nope.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:47]** And you immediately were like, let's just run inside.

**[01:03:48 - 01:03:48]** Okay.

**[01:03:49 - 01:03:49]** Cool, cool, cool.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** So we do.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:55]** You make it inside.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:56]** You find some interesting things.

**[01:03:56 - 01:03:57]** Anybody remember what you found?

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:58]** Conjure card?

**[01:03:59 - 01:03:59]** Yeah.

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** And...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:06]** I got a reversal token.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:09]** I don't remember the name of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** Charm of reversal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:13]** Charm of reversal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:20]** And I got the brush that makes inanimate objects go and tell you their name.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:22]** I got f***ing nothing.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:24]** At least Cletus lived.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:04:24 - 01:04:25]** Cletus did live.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:31]** I think you were the only one that didn't pass the inspection check.

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:58]** sucks to suck yeah i guess um right yeah it's gonna miss me um and so you try to figure out what we're doing and the river's trying to get at you and it immediately is just like okay let's get out of there um it grabs cole tries to drown him


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:04:59 - 01:04:59]** Yeah, that was wild.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** Were you just waiting the whole time?

**[01:05:01 - 01:05:06]** As soon as we didn't address the river, what was going through your head as a GM?

**[01:05:06 - 01:05:07]** Being like, all right, they're inside.

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:10]** Well, they can only explore for so long.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:10]** Right.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:19]** It's one of those like, what would actually happen to a crazy body of water running under basically a building on stilts?

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:21]** that building is not going to last for very long.

**[01:05:22 - 01:05:23]** So like eventually the water is going to get in.

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:33]** Um, so I think I had in my head a bit of a timer for like how much, like how long I was going to give you to explore and find what you needed to find.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:40]** And then like, okay, the river's tired of this and is going to reach in and grab someone.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:42]** Um, yeah.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:44]** so yeah, it was, it was a lot of that.

**[01:05:44 - 01:05:45]** There were, there were other options.

**[01:05:46 - 01:05:51]** You could have like fought the river and, and defeated it that way.

**[01:05:51 - 01:06:00]** You could have, and what you ended up doing was negotiating with the river and like convincing it that you're not the people who stole her friend and caretaker.

**[01:06:00 - 01:06:01]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:09]** No matter which path you took, Vinny, my response was going to be turning into a bear.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:10]** Absolutely.

**[01:06:10 - 01:06:13]** Whichever way you wanted to go, boom, bear.

**[01:06:13 - 01:06:14]** That is my response.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:19]** I love because I couldn't, like, I forgot you had that.

**[01:06:20 - 01:06:22]** Until the moment you said, I turn into a bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:26]** It's like the only reason I picked Ira.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:28]** It's like, of course he turns into a bear.

**[01:06:28 - 01:06:30]** Yes, all the sense in the world.

**[01:06:30 - 01:06:31]** All the sense in the world.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:33]** Be the bear.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:35]** Ira the bear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:50]** And then it was also a nice moment because like we had established that Ira and Cole kind of ran in similar circles and they had had some, you know, some past interactions, but weren't necessarily like best friends.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:55]** So it was a nice little bonding kind of thing for Ira to jump in and try to save Cole.


## Speaker_0

**[01:06:55 - 01:06:55]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:06:57 - 01:07:22]** um so you get and then i got to be a bear for a lot longer than that too which was a lot longer yeah that i because the the spell is like 20 30 minutes it's a long time it's an hour it's an hour yeah yeah so yeah i actually like i was reading through the story to figure out about how long and it was like yeah you sure stay a bear if you want to stay a bear um

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:43]** um the you find the drag marks after like getting calming the river um you find some mushrooms on the way and find out that they'll wreck you uh you discover the old mine and lost mine yeah

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:57]** Um, what's fun is like the, the ghosts that were there, uh, as you get to the, the, the mine, I asked you to make like a perception or an investigation check and no one saw anything.

**[01:07:57 - 01:08:02]** And so like those ghosts have one job.

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:10]** And that one job is to like notify Kjarn that someone else has stepped into the mine.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:12]** Presumably to rescue the Watermaider.

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:24]** And so like, had you noticed them, you would have had an opportunity to either like confront them or attack them or, you know...

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:28]** change their mind and figure out how they could not go tell Kjarn yet.

**[01:08:28 - 01:08:31]** And like would have had some more time with the watermander.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:39]** Um, but since nobody saw them, they, you know, kind of got away and raised the alarm and then attacked.

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:39]** Yeah.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:50]** I feel like there are a lot more options here that you had available to you in the narrative than we were aware of.

**[01:08:50 - 01:08:54]** But that's okay, because instead we chose what we wanted to do in your role with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:55 - 01:08:57]** Yeah.

**[01:08:58 - 01:09:00]** So you make it through the mine.

**[01:09:02 - 01:09:03]** That was one thing.

**[01:09:03 - 01:09:11]** I wish I had made the mine a little more difficult with some intrusions, because this is an old, ill, taken care of...

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:15]** Some rocks falling or puddles of water slipping would have been great.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:16]** Cave in.

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:17]** Yeah.

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:20]** Cliff or... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:20]** Ledge.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:21]** Yeah.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:22]** It's all good.

**[01:09:22 - 01:09:28]** Eventually, you make it to the water rander, who is a sweet little old lady.


## Speaker_0

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:29]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:32]** Who we didn't think was, was her at first.

**[01:09:32 - 01:09:34]** Cause what was it that you said?

**[01:09:34 - 01:09:38]** You, you said something like, like I just mixed it the other day.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:42]** Like you, uh, what did you say?

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:47]** You said something about like, Oh, that rabbit rabbit is the cleverest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:47]** Yes.

**[01:09:48 - 01:09:58]** And I remember will being like, Oh, like, yeah, you guys thought she was a bad guy for a second.


## Speaker_0

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:58]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:59]** Yeah.

**[01:09:59 - 01:09:59]** Yeah.

**[01:09:59 - 01:10:02]** Or, or at least like a, a trickster guy.

**[01:10:02 - 01:10:03]** Right.

**[01:10:03 - 01:10:05]** Like I thought maybe she was a fellow trickster guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:06]** Was she?

**[01:10:06 - 01:10:08]** No, she, she is legit.

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:14]** Like, she's just, she's the, the foremost like authority on the green trickster guys.

**[01:10:15 - 01:10:17]** And like, just takes good care of the river.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:20]** That's, that's all she does.

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:23]** Uh, yeah.

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:27]** But yarn working for someone, um,

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:40]** needed to remove her from activity, needed to bind her up and her magic up so that they could get their damn bill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:10:42 - 01:10:44]** Yeah, I did like that Kiaran tried to enlist us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:45]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:10:46 - 01:10:47]** That was a real option.

**[01:10:48 - 01:10:56]** I wasn't sure if you guys were going to take that or not, but I had that planned out.

**[01:10:57 - 01:11:03]** Because I wasn't sure if that was going to be like, oh, maybe they really like the offer of power and money and influence.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:05 - 01:11:08]** But, you know, you guys... That would have been an interesting route to go.

**[01:11:08 - 01:11:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:12 - 01:11:13]** Would we have fought the Watermen?

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:14]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:14 - 01:11:37]** see that that was the sticking point is like if we hadn't already established that like ira knew the watermander and like respected her because of her magical knowledge if that plot point hadn't been established then maybe you know yeah that and i think that might have that was the kicker because ira especially like being kind of she's my friend


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:38 - 01:11:40]** Yeah, that's true.

**[01:11:40 - 01:11:41]** She's your homie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:42 - 01:11:46]** I don't know that she feels that way, but he feels that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:11:46 - 01:11:49]** She is your homie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:11:49 - 01:11:50]** You are not her homie.

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:51]** Right.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:52]** Exactly.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:54]** She's definitely your best friend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:11:59 - 01:12:02]** I would say Cole is probably Ira's best friend.

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:03]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:14]** So she gives you the spell and things to use to unbind her from all of this.

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:22]** And we discover that the mushrooms that you grabbed along the way were in fact useful and not just to like hurt you.

**[01:12:26 - 01:12:31]** And Cole steps the F word up.

**[01:12:33 - 01:12:37]** And completes this, uh... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:37 - 01:12:38]** Bad answer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:38]** Yeah.

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:39]** This is spectacular.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:12:39 - 01:12:41]** Just like... What did I end up doing?

**[01:12:41 - 01:12:42]** I forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:42 - 01:12:44]** I mean, you made the roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:12:46 - 01:12:46]** Yeah.

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:47]** You rolled really high.

**[01:12:47 - 01:12:48]** Yeah.

**[01:12:49 - 01:12:51]** But, like, you had an inability or something with magic.

**[01:12:52 - 01:12:59]** So then it was like, you just suddenly, like, all of your protection energy came out.

**[01:12:59 - 01:13:00]** Instinct came in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:00]** Yeah.

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:03]** Yeah.

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:03]** Yep.

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:04]** To defend what matters.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:06 - 01:13:07]** Yep.

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:10]** With a little assistance from Ira's ghost grandpappy.

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:11]** Yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:11 - 01:13:12]** Yep.

**[01:13:12 - 01:13:13]** Yeah.

**[01:13:14 - 01:13:17]** I really thought we were going to, like, make up a new memory.


## Speaker_0

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:45]** to share because remember part of the ritual was you had to share a memory and like share a memory yeah that was yeah that was just a miss it was like i think we all got lost and entangled a little bit i mean i was fine to just forget the the basement in in the speakeasy right which was an actual memory because i didn't want to cheat because i don't like the consequences of cheating of


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:45 - 01:14:06]** uh yeah i mean i thought that too but then somebody brought up like the camouflage pants because i think we're talking about that so then suddenly it became about stealing the camouflage off of a cadaver or something like that and i was like all right yeah it's all good i don't know we got we got finney what was your expectation of that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:10]** I thought you would do something from the speakeasy.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:15]** I thought you would do the original death as a child, maybe.

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:18]** I thought you might do one of the moments from the funeral.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:23]** Let's just all forget about Julius.

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:24]** Right.

**[01:14:24 - 01:14:26]** Collectively.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:26 - 01:14:28]** Like, oh, there's a ghost.

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:28]** He just started attacking.

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:31]** He could have been, he just stood on with the possum palace.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:34]** We all forget that rabbit rabbit contacted us and we just go home.

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:36 - 01:14:37]** That's it.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:37]** Right.

**[01:14:37 - 01:14:38]** End of game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:38 - 01:14:38]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:14:39 - 01:14:40]** Oh my God.

**[01:14:40 - 01:14:40]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:45]** And then charge shows up and the big fight.

**[01:14:45 - 01:14:46]** And so yeah, skin Walker.

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:46]** Yeah.

**[01:14:47 - 01:14:54]** Uh, skin wrapped, like lanky appendages, just like ready to wrap.


## Speaker_0

**[01:14:55 - 01:14:55]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:14:57 - 01:15:02]** And so, yeah, I was trying to figure out the soft, like, situationally appropriate way to describe skin leather.

**[01:15:04 - 01:15:06]** But, like... People leather?

**[01:15:06 - 01:15:07]** People leather.

**[01:15:07 - 01:15:08]** Pleather, if you will.

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:10]** Oh, good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:15:11 - 01:15:15]** It's just... That's what I think.

**[01:15:16 - 01:15:18]** Just a bunch of sewed-on faces.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:15:19 - 01:15:27]** But, yeah, just, like, the idea that his skin leather was what was wrapping the watermander is, like...

**[01:15:27 - 01:15:41]** yeah it's gross um yeah a little gross yeah um and yeah the the big evil bad guy fight ensues


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:15:43 - 01:16:04]** what were you guys thinking at that point like i thought it would be a lot longer yeah i did too i think that's why i left a little bit disappointed with combat because like i thought that was going to be a like harrowing like somebody's probably gonna die type fight and like you nerf when it finished i was like oh that's it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:16:04 - 01:16:10]** Yeah, that what was funny was I because I talked a bit about how I pulled punches on on the white thing.

**[01:16:11 - 01:16:18]** I pulled up with both barrels for yarn and like added a ghost back in because you didn't kill that one.

**[01:16:18 - 01:16:19]** You only killed the other one.

**[01:16:20 - 01:16:21]** And like,

**[01:16:22 - 01:16:32]** He, as written, I remember looking at the character sheet, and Cole did work.

**[01:16:33 - 01:16:36]** I thought I didn't even hit him, though.

**[01:16:36 - 01:16:39]** I thought it was Cole and Ira that just went in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:39 - 01:16:41]** It was Cole and Grandpappy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:43 - 01:16:44]** On the ghost or on the boss?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:16:44 - 01:16:45]** On the boss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:16:46 - 01:16:49]** Did I land one?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:49]** You did, yeah.

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:51]** You did, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:16:52 - 01:16:52]** Yeah, you definitely did.

**[01:16:53 - 01:16:58]** And, like, we got to the end of round two, I think, and he was almost dead.

**[01:16:58 - 01:17:03]** I was like, okay, I guess this is why GMs fudge health points.

**[01:17:04 - 01:17:06]** But...

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:13]** It was a weird, like, okay, I could add another 20 or 30 to his health point pool and, like, make this a longer battle.

**[01:17:14 - 01:17:19]** Or, like, what difference would this make?

**[01:17:19 - 01:17:22]** Is it really going to change the stakes of this battle?

**[01:17:23 - 01:17:24]** I don't know.

**[01:17:24 - 01:17:24]** Maybe.

**[01:17:25 - 01:17:25]** Maybe not.

**[01:17:27 - 01:17:29]** Like, it felt like I would have drawn the battle out for battle's sake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:17:29 - 01:17:30]** I kind of leaned towards it.

**[01:17:31 - 01:17:56]** maybe that was a misstep on my part this is just just me personally i think it would have absolutely like increased the stakes of it like if if we all walk out of that mind like on death's door you know having gone through something like really really really difficult uh you know i think that maybe does change you know perspectives and stuff coming out yeah that's fair yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:17:57 - 01:18:00]** I also see your point, Benny, of, like, is it just for combat's sake?

**[01:18:00 - 01:18:03]** Which, like, if that's not what you were trying to do, then that's not what you were trying to do.

**[01:18:04 - 01:18:10]** But I think I lean with Heath that it would have, like, changed how he felt about it at the end.

**[01:18:10 - 01:18:16]** I mean, I was ready to throw that darkness bomb or whatever and then just have everyone be like, all right, GTFO.

**[01:18:16 - 01:18:18]** Like, we'll figure it out later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:18:18 - 01:18:20]** Well, and also considering, like...

**[01:18:21 - 01:18:25]** You know, it's a short adventure to begin with, right?

**[01:18:25 - 01:18:28]** And so there aren't that many opportunities to do combat.

**[01:18:28 - 01:18:38]** So I definitely see your... Like, in general, in gaming or GMing, like, you know, you don't always want to just extend combat to do more combat.

**[01:18:38 - 01:18:39]** Like, that's completely fair.

**[01:18:40 - 01:18:43]** But I do think it's because it was a shorter adventure and that was the end one.

**[01:18:44 - 01:18:48]** You could have kind of gone hard in the pain on us and it...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:18:48 - 01:19:15]** would have been appropriate you know i don't think it would have just been for the sake of the fun of combat you know yeah yeah i agree um and so we wrap that up you guys win we walk out of the mine and appear back in the clearing where julius has a decision to make yeah i yeah i didn't know like where you were going with that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:19:16 - 01:19:22]** I didn't know either because I didn't know that I would have the option to die.

**[01:19:22 - 01:19:28]** Truthfully, I literally thought that it would be just a, like, all right, you're good to go.

**[01:19:29 - 01:19:32]** And there was just something about, like, I kind of pictured the end of, what is it?

**[01:19:33 - 01:19:35]** Well, I don't want to say what it is because it's a spoiler.

**[01:19:35 - 01:19:40]** But the show The Good Place has a lot of really interesting ideas about that.

**[01:19:41 - 01:19:44]** And I just felt like Julius, like...

**[01:19:44 - 01:20:11]** it fit i think that julius in the beginning tells his dad that he wants to come back and he's like yeah i'm gonna do that like cool like let's go on this adventure and then uh i'll figure out a way to come back to you and then by the end it it makes sense that maybe his perspective has changed a little bit as he's seen a little more of uh what the world has to offer and and knowing his place in it and realizing that his place is not to be in the world anymore

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:15]** So it felt more like that was the appropriate choice for him to make.

**[01:20:15 - 01:20:16]** Of course, I wanted him to come back.

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:17]** That'd be great.

**[01:20:18 - 01:20:22]** But, uh, but it just felt like that was the better, that was the better choice.

**[01:20:22 - 01:20:28]** And I have to say, whenever I said it, like I think about the interactions that I had with the three of you, uh,

**[01:20:29 - 01:20:45]** kelly heath and and will like that was like like saying goodbye to you three was really really fun and interesting and i was like really trying to fire on all cylinders there to engage with you and i felt like you all did the same and so that was that was a fun thing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:20:46 - 01:20:47]** I think it's interesting.

**[01:20:47 - 01:20:58]** It ties back to kind of a point you made earlier where you start off with a scene of when we're kids, and then you jump forward, and it's like we maybe have been around each other but not close for a long time.

**[01:20:58 - 01:21:04]** And so, you know, the whole actual playtime of the adventure is kind of rekindling a friendship.

**[01:21:05 - 01:21:10]** But I think that final, like, saying goodbye stuff was...

**[01:21:11 - 01:21:24]** in a cool way, like bringing back, it was kind of reverting to childhood a little bit, you know, like the closeness came from the little bit of stuff we just went through, but really from being such good childhood friends, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:25]** Yeah.

**[01:21:25 - 01:21:25]** Yeah.

**[01:21:26 - 01:21:27]** That's a great point.

**[01:21:27 - 01:21:28]** I agree with that.

**[01:21:28 - 01:21:28]** Yeah.

**[01:21:30 - 01:21:30]** And then we wrap.

**[01:21:31 - 01:21:33]** So thank you.

**[01:21:34 - 01:21:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:21:35 - 01:21:38]** Wanted to highlight Vinny and say, great job.

**[01:21:38 - 01:21:40]** Yeah, dude, you were, you were a great jam for this.

**[01:21:41 - 01:21:41]** This is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:42 - 01:21:42]** Oh yeah.

**[01:21:42 - 01:21:44]** For the, just, just good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:45 - 01:21:47]** I was like, was this your first time GMing anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:48 - 01:21:49]** Uh, this is the first time GMing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:21:49 - 01:21:51]** Or have you GMed other stuff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:21:51 - 01:21:52]** Uh, I've GMed, not on the show.

**[01:21:52 - 01:21:55]** Uh, I've GMed some 5e for my nephews.

**[01:21:56 - 01:22:02]** Um, but like never, never anything rules light, never anything like narrative driven.

**[01:22:02 - 01:22:08]** Um, and they're, I, I love my nephews and their dad, but they're straight up murder hobos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:09 - 01:22:13]** And so, yeah, I mean, I mean, that's why you play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:22:13 - 01:22:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:13 - 01:22:13]** Yeah.

**[01:22:13 - 01:22:18]** I've considered several times and I always think better of it.

**[01:22:19 - 01:22:25]** Trying to see if I can start a D&D 5E club or just a D&D club at the school that I work at.

**[01:22:26 - 01:22:31]** Because I'm the perfect person to do it of anybody who works in the entire school district.

**[01:22:31 - 01:22:33]** But I'm also like...

**[01:22:33 - 01:22:39]** That's committing a lot more hours to unpaid labor on top of a stressful job.

**[01:22:39 - 01:22:39]** Yeah.

**[01:22:40 - 01:22:43]** But in my head, I would love to do that, you know?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:22:43 - 01:22:44]** Yeah.

**[01:22:44 - 01:22:45]** I think that would be a lot of fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:22:45 - 01:22:47]** But either way, good job.

**[01:22:48 - 01:22:49]** good job GMing.

**[01:22:49 - 01:22:50]** I didn't, I didn't know.

**[01:22:50 - 01:22:57]** I knew y'all had mentioned like you hadn't GMed much stuff, but I wasn't sure the full context of what your experience was.

**[01:22:57 - 01:23:03]** So, I mean, you know, really awesome job considering you haven't GMed very much.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:23:03 - 01:23:07]** I think I'm happy with it for the first time out of the gate.

**[01:23:07 - 01:23:12]** I think I, I know some things that I would change and maybe embellish in different ways.


## Speaker_0

**[01:23:14 - 01:23:14]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:23:14 - 01:23:18]** That's going to happen every time you GM anything, no matter how experienced you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:23:20 - 01:23:22]** I felt like your embellishments were really clear and nice.

**[01:23:23 - 01:23:24]** There was a lot of clarity to them.

**[01:23:24 - 01:23:25]** I felt like I was pulled in.

**[01:23:26 - 01:23:27]** Immersed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:23:27 - 01:23:31]** Yeah, I think the embellishments were probably the best parts, in my opinion.

**[01:23:32 - 01:23:34]** But I also feel like that in general.

**[01:23:35 - 01:23:37]** The improv is one of my favorite parts of the games.

**[01:23:37 - 01:23:38]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:24:06 - 01:24:07]** Yeah, exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:24:09 - 01:24:14]** And to that, I will say we might find out if we ever run Three Gods.

**[01:24:47 - 01:24:50]** And if we refive old gods, we might find out.

**[01:24:51 - 01:24:53]** It might go by the wayside.

**[01:24:53 - 01:24:54]** We'll see.

**[01:24:55 - 01:25:01]** There are ties that exist in the canon of this universe, but we've not yet explored them.
