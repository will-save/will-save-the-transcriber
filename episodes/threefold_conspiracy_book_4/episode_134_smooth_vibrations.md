## Speaker_0

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:21]** Hello friends.

**[00:00:21 - 00:00:21]** Welcome to my channel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:27]** Welcome to Let's End the Podcast!

**[00:01:27 - 00:01:28]** What's up, folks?

**[00:01:28 - 00:01:29]** How we doing?

**[00:01:30 - 00:01:31]** I am your... What's up, fools?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:31 - 00:01:31]** What's up, fools?

**[00:01:32 - 00:01:45]** I'm your red crystal GM, because I couldn't think of a better word, John Swan, joined by my fellow shiny rocks here hanging out with me, Kevin, Kelly, Will, and Vinny, who are sparkling like diamonds in front of me.

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** Looking good tonight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:48]** You know what I'm saying?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:49]** Y'all looking good.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** Yeah.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** Yeah.

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** Looking sexy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:54]** Thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:01:54 - 00:01:55]** Yeah.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** You're very, you're very welcome.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:56]** Question.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** It's that time.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** It's that, it's that time.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:00]** It's what happens on Wednesdays.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:01]** You get questions.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:09]** What is the, the, the best or the worst piece of advice that you've ever received?

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:13]** You know, could be like, oh yeah, for sure.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** Like, yeah, I'll certainly take that one into account.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:18]** Or, you know what?

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:20]** That actually was really helpful.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:23]** I really, really appreciate that.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:26]** Or it could have been, here's how to make your lawn smell better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:35]** I have a recommendation to make it smell worse but look better.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:49]** There's a fertilizer called Milorganite, which is made from the fired off microbes that process wastewater.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** It's relatively cheap.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:53]** It makes your lawn smell terrible for like a week.

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:59]** But because it's natural, there's no way to over-fertilize and nitrogen burn your grass.

**[00:02:59 - 00:03:03]** It actually really does a good job of conditioning the soil.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:06]** So thank you, random Reddit person, for putting me on the Milorganite.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:17]** The one piece of advice, and I don't remember where I read it, that I've started to live by is everyone has their fight.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:24]** Like, if you see somebody that's happy-go-lucky, you're like, I want that.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:26]** Everyone has their fight.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:30]** That person is struggling with something, and the grass isn't ever as green.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:43]** And also, if I'm dealing with this asshole at work, my old job, I used to have someone who would email me with the urgent flags for every single email, and that really ticked me off.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:48]** But also like I could sit back and like, okay, everyone has their fight.

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:51]** She's probably going through some stuff and that's why she's being a dick to me.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:55]** So like I can, I can give her grace.

**[00:03:55 - 00:04:01]** So like, yeah, it's kind of the, um, the, the Tom Hanks from that round table.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** This too shall pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:03]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:04]** Yeah.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:04]** Yeah.

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:05]** In the same line of things.

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:09]** Um, Lauren read a book one time called it's just a cow.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:20]** And the whole book is talking about, it's about anger management, essentially, and managing your own emotions because everything's a cow.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** You just have to wait for it to pass.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:29]** So for me, it really changed the way that I drive.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** because that car in front of you is doing something stupid.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:39]** But if you just picture it to be a cow and wait for it to get out of the way, and then you go around it.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:43]** I think that's some of the best advice that I've ever gotten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:46]** You don't just flip off a cow when you're going by.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:48]** No.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** You don't tip cows.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:51]** I don't honk at cows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:51]** No.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:53]** I don't honk at cows.

**[00:04:54 - 00:05:01]** I was going to say that I, the person who is not going through a fight and who is not a cow is whoever's cutting me off.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:02]** They are just pure evil.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** I just, I want to.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** John honks at everybody.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** I do.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:07]** I do honk at people.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** I probably shouldn't.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:08]** Really?

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** That's good.

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:28]** maybe that's that's good maybe maybe not i don't know i'm i'm torn on this kind of question because like i used to be like more forgiving and i become less forgiving over time actually sort of move the opposite direction and actually for me sometimes that works out better i've like this

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:34]** I actually admire and maybe I think like what Vinny's talking about is maybe better.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:43]** But sometimes I feel like matching someone's energy when they're a piece of shit like kind of gets you what you want out of it and they deserve it.

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:46]** So just be really aggressive driving towards them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:48]** I'm going to cut you off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** Head on collision.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** It depends.

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:55]** I'm trying to find the middle ground because now I've kind of come this other direction.

**[00:05:55 - 00:06:02]** But like, yeah, so I'm still figuring out when it's appropriate to do that and when not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** Yeah.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:06]** Not that you asked my opinion or anything.

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:19]** In my experience, if it's something that's one-to-one, like happening in private, in email, on the phone, I'll extend grace.

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:23]** If it's something that's happening in public, in front of people...

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:35]** I will typically pause and ask them to either say it again or frame it in a way where they either have to double down or apologize.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:38]** That's probably good.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:45]** That way, they have a moment to check their own temperature to see if they really want to be a dick or not.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:46]** Yeah.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** And then that's them showing who they are.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:54]** I'm trying to give people like, cause sometimes you can misinterpret things too.

**[00:06:55 - 00:07:05]** So like what I'm trying to do is give people like it, and it depends on my closeness to them, but like one or two chances before I'm like, sure that like what they're doing is like kind of up thing.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** Um, and it, it completely depends on the situation.

**[00:07:09 - 00:07:13]** Uh, but yeah, sometimes, sometimes I give no chances as well.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** So, um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:35]** i don't know i i think that's probably good vinnie i think that's good this totally turned into like a mental health communication thing that i did not yeah i know imagine at all it's cool right yeah like you're just looking for like what's a weird yeah i don't know yeah i mean that's fine too you know it's all good it's all it's all it's all good um okay okay go um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:41]** I saw, I think it was Pirate Software was talking about diatomaceous earth for ant control.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** That works.

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:43]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:44]** Really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:44]** Yes, it does.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** What is it?

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** Beetles, too.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:46]** Yeah.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:49]** I mean, any crawling insect, really.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:52]** Throw some diatomaceous earth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:56]** Like on the threshold or something so they don't cross it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** Yeah, or where they're coming in or whatever.

**[00:07:58 - 00:07:59]** They'll die.

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]** Oh, wow.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** They won't go through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** You gotta keep it dry, though, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** Yeah, you gotta keep it dry.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:09]** And it's, you know, like, don't get it in your eyes, stuff like that.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:09]** Is it poisonous?

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** No, it's not poisonous.

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:18]** It's just like shards of glass to insects, and it will viscerate their internals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:22]** It'll tear out their insides, which is kind of amazing.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:23]** Yeah, crazy.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:28]** And then other roaches will eat the roach that ate that, and then they'll all just, like, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** They'll all just get shards of glass.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:31]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:55]** yeah diatomaceous earth um that's a good piece of advice good good that is good pest control advice um it's a good pro tip good assume good intent but don't ignore bad behavior is some good you know personal relationship advice that's good yeah yeah um i like that discipline i think is like the key

**[00:08:56 - 00:09:10]** to any successful endeavor it beats motivation yep totally agree um the classic under promise over deliver oh man i do that all i try and do that as much um


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:39]** bad advice yeah um man there's so much there's so much i'll share one piece of good advice while you're looking that up and then i want to play but uh um after you show you some bad advice the one that i learned in music school and that i recently thought about again at like day job work and then music and everything else i was like okay this always makes sense slow is smooth smooth is fast

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:43]** That like mindset is like, wow, cool.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:46]** Cause I was literally doing it, trying to learn how to play something.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:50]** And my teacher was like, yo, we're going to crank this metronome down like 30 BPM.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:57]** And you're going to play it perfectly like 10 times slow and then go up two to five BPM after every time.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:01]** And he was like the smoothie, like you can play it, then you can play it faster.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:04]** And then now it's like, I can't unhear it.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:26]** like in my playing like i can hear when i chip that note and i'm like no i should let me take a second and like like think about it and then i try and do that when i'm like overwhelmed or stressed at at work or getting ready for something i'm like you know what if i just take it slow for a second it'll actually all the all the oscillations will kind of settle out and i can stay smooth


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:32]** I think the big bad advice that I would like to dispel at this moment.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:33]** Dispel it.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** Dispel magic.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:41]** If somebody's like the negative connotation of quitting, like never quit, don't quit.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:44]** Like sometimes quitting is the right move, y'all.

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:47]** Yeah, it's fair.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:52]** Knowing when to walk away from something bad or a bad investment, it's the best skill you can learn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** Absolutely.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:54]** Kelly?

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:57]** Yeah, that kind of reminds me.

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:01]** There's a lot of maxims that people just repeat, sort of like memes.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** You know what I mean?

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:04]** Without really thinking about what they mean or terrifying.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:06]** It's not what you know, it's who you know.

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** Yeah, they can be platitudes.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:18]** Yeah, or they'll be like the grass is always greener to sort of derisively be like, well, don't keep thinking about something else when you have what you have.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:22]** And sometimes that's valid, but sometimes the grass literally is greener.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:29]** So it's not necessarily true that going for something different and trying to try a new life is a bad thing.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:34]** But people just repeat stuff all the time without thinking about them from first principles.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:36]** And I think that that can be harmful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:36 - 00:12:06]** yeah it's true so challenging conventional wisdom is something that you should that's also a good piece of advice challenge conventional wisdom well there's certainly no green grass in the corundum of minds here there is there's certainly no diatomaceous earth slows slows fast and some slow lava is smooth crystal and smooth crystals fast i don't know if here's went more slowly down he wouldn't have cut himself

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** Yeah, that's true.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:09]** He wouldn't have cut himself if he was trying to stay slow.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:11]** If he would have just rolled the dice slowly.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** You know what it was?

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:12]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:15]** That was a diatomaceous earth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:16]** Diatomaceous earth.

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:17]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** Because he's a bug.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:18]** He's a bug.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:19]** Oh, my God.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:23]** Rick is taking notes right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** He's like, oh, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:30]** Yeah, PT's over there sprinkling it around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** You guys have learned my weakness.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** PT's pulling it out of his pocket.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** He's throwing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** So you step on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:36 - 00:13:02]** is it pd or pt like p dot t dot or is it p dot p e here let me okay okay let me make his name because it's an android i don't know it could be acronyms and uh it's p dot yeah p dot t dot always for everybody you should be able to see his name when we come back well last time was certainly he's really big in a personal physical therapy yeah he's yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** Well, I used to be a physical therapist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:09]** No, you haven't asked about his origins.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:14]** But you did ask and talk about a lot of things with everyone here.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:32]** It was a very heartwarming episode last time, eating some home-cooked food, sitting around the table breaking bread with all the Azers, and then with the androids, the escaped prisoners, also members of the android abolitionist front.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:37]** And they are also wanted by Rudy.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:43]** So sort of an intersection of conflicting motives there for you all.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** A lot of different opportunities.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** I had a good time talking with them.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:50]** Spoke with Lydia Searstone.

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:52]** Spoke with the doctor.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:57]** Dr. O'Kay and Colin trying to help with the community.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Do some good there.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:02]** See who you can speak to to help them cope.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** Help them heal.

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:21]** Rick 19 speaking with PD having a little stroll and a walk coming to find out that Rick 19, maybe you didn't know that your Android abolitionist front tattoo, which do you want to share some more light on, on what that is?

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:26]** I don't know if there is more, but I mean, it's in the Pizer wrote it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:27]** Right.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:28]** It's an actual thing.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:34]** I had it all brought up and I closed it all out, but it's an encryption tattoo and there's different levels of it.

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:49]** And basically everybody who is a member of the Android abolitionist front has this tattoo that they can use a code word and it'll, it'll light up to basically authenticate that they are a part of that organization to other members.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:51]** Yeah.

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:54]** Rick didn't know his code.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:56]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:59]** It was the same code that Dr. Okay.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:03]** Do you get special powers now, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:04]** Rick, you didn't know the code.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:06]** It might just be good to just quit.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:09]** Just walk away and be like, PD, I quit.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:10]** I'm not part of it.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:10]** I'm done.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:10]** I'm done.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** You know what?

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:11]** I'm out.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:13]** I didn't know the code.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:13 - 00:15:14]** I'm sorry.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:19]** I don't think that's something you should quit on, but yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:21]** It makes you happy if it's the right move.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:23]** There's some things you can't quit.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:26]** I just watched Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:28]** Amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** You're talking with him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:31]** The TV show or the movie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:35]** The TV show I do want to see because I've heard it's good.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:36]** But back to this.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** You were talking with

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:40]** Petey about this.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:44]** He also brings up and shares with you kind of his experience.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:57]** He and Dell were looking into this gang and connection to a Rose Light security group and some loose connections to the stewards when they were somewhat anonymously involved.

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:03]** taken captive, found themselves on a bleak prison on Varos.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:12]** They also share with you that they think that Roselight, it sounds like that's your next mission.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:18]** And there is also someone else there in the AAF who can speak with you.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:23]** They tell you to head to the Roselight Avarium and text a phone number.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:40]** And finally, he says, I typically am the one who distributes and works on the tattoos, these encryption tattoos for new members and members as they grow and rank.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:43]** But I can't give you the next rank.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:46]** You would need to go speak with the members there.

**[00:16:46 - 00:17:16]** i can however i've activated yours and i'm able to give some other tattoos he has a bit of an artistry about him you can see that he has on his body on his neck he has tattoos and he says that he's able to give some tattoos if they want it to dr okay here's colin and then here's you stumble make your way down the cliff jumping uh it's only like 10 or 15 feet

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:37]** And you head out onto this island of steel, of almost obliterated, um, wrought metal that used to be a platform where conveyors of mines or of, um, different gems of different stones, everything came gurgling out of whatever depths they were digging.

**[00:17:38 - 00:18:01]** several computers nearby you go to boot up the computer and when you do actually i'll just play the sound because it was a cool sound oh that's good yeah when you play it thank you sirenscape

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:18]** you play it you find out as it the computer comes on that the name ring works flickers on the screen as if it's a ring works device that you're moving into what do you do here's


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:23]** Does Hears actually... Does Hears himself know what Ringworks is?

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** It's a good question.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** We'll culture check it, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:27]** You would have heard... Well, everyone would... Yeah.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:30]** Yeah, Ringworks is a very large corporation.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:36]** It's like, I don't know, Boeing or GM, you know, that kind of thing.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:37]** Northrop.

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:37]** Oh, okay.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:41]** Yeah, they make... Archer Daniels, Midland.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:47]** They make starships and weapons and just pretty much anything mechanical you can think of.

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:48]** They...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:50]** Like GE.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** Like GE.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:53]** GE, yeah.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** Hopefully better than GE.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** Yeah, hopefully better than GE.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** Screw GE.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:58 - 00:19:26]** what's the what was the um the lg it's a kawasaki uh there was a a joke that you can get like uh or hibachi or no i forget there's there's one where it's like you've got like a tractor and oh and a keyboard like they could kind of go like the full gambit like yeah makers of fine instruments and motorcycles and atvs and weird things geez also like that except everything they make is a better garbage


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:48]** um yeah now so anyway uh yeah now it is not you know the good old days the good old days not in the good old days that's why boeing sucks because all the ge people went there uh so um all right well that's true we're all gonna die


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:51]** It's not PD that did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:52]** PD did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:55]** So here's, back to ring work.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:55]** PD was made by Boeing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:55 - 00:20:04]** If you're a Boeing whistleblower, write us and tell us that it'll be okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:04]** Yeah.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:08]** And then enjoy this ep.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:16]** So with that said, a UI comes up and it's, you can tell that it's stable for now.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:20]** These have not been booted up probably since before whatever cataclysm happened.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:22 - 00:20:22]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:27]** And you think you might have a few minutes to get whatever you need off of this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:30]** Well, we'll do that.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Okay.

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:34]** He's going to attempt to download as much information as possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:34]** Okay.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** Give me a computer's check.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:39]** Pull out your USB-Z cord.

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:41]** Plug it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:42]** USB-Z?

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:42]** Yeah.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** 26.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:43]** 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** 26.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:49]** Yeah, you're able to pull a pretty significant amount, most everything.

**[00:20:50 - 00:21:01]** You're clicking through your, I am not computer savvy, but you're able to pull as much readable information as you can off of it that you can then adapt and put into another form, whatever you need.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** R, sync, A, B, Z. Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:04]** Nailed it.

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:07]** You do notice that there's a firewall.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:07]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:12]** There seems to be... There's probably something else in there.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:16]** So you would need to give another computer check in order to break through that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:19]** Here sees that.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:26]** And then he moves through the terminal trying to get in.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** 32 is what he rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:28]** 32.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:28]** Okay.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:35]** Yeah, whoever set this up clearly laid...

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:41]** all this extra infrastructure on top of just a very basic Ringworks system.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** So this wouldn't be something that you can buy.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:44]** There's no way.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:48]** Somebody at Ringworks made all of this here.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:55]** They took whatever mining equipment that they might have had some sort of service offerings in line, the products that they have, right?

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:03]** And they really made a custom unit here, including these pockets where you could jump in past the firewall and grab some stored data.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:06]** And you're able to...

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:08]** Upload all of it.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:15]** And right as you upload the last one, there's like this.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** The sound.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:19]** And then the computer goes dark.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:20]** Then you've got.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:23]** Right as I download the last one?

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:24]** Yeah.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** So did I finish the download?

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:27]** You did.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** The stuff that was past the firewall, right?

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** Yeah.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** So we got 100% of everything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:35]** You got everything that you could see on there.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** You got through the firewall.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** You got everything that was on there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:48]** Well, here's, we'll, uh, look at what he downloaded in his data pad and, um, what, what is he seeing generally here?

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:52]** Like, is there any thing beyond just mining stuff here?

**[00:22:52 - 00:22:54]** And of course the obvious stuff related to mining.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:54]** Yeah.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:56]** I may ask.

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:05]** There are a couple of things, but before we get there, let's check in with, check in with everybody else.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** Colin, Dr. Okay.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:10]** You've been walking around with Lydia.

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:14]** There's not a lot to walk around and see.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:16]** What do you...

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:20]** what do you start to do after that?

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:23]** After she's talking to you, she showed you some of their equipment that they have.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:28]** They have some, uh, you know, Mark two and three serums of healing.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** They have some medical kits.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:31]** It's pretty basic supplies.

**[00:23:31 - 00:23:34]** Um, she's a good doctor, but she just doesn't have all the supplies.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:40]** She's not on your levels of like research and understanding and breadth of experience, but you can tell that she's capable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:46]** You know, uh, is there any like equipment that could be used to enhance weapons or armor?


## Speaker_0

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:46]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:23:47 - 00:24:04]** Uh, yeah, you do know that there are, there's a stockpile of, uh, equipment there that they have that you're not sure where it came from, from them, or you can talk to them, but, uh, it's Grom Dahlia is the person who's the kind of owner of that inventory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:08]** I'm going to seek Grom Dahlia out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** Okay.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:11]** You start to talk to Grom Dahlia.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** You walk over.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:14]** Colin, what are you doing during this time?


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:15]** Uh,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:40]** uh i think colin's gonna get right to work he's gonna go seek out uh phalanx pharynx yes f-e-r-a yeah pharynx yeah yeah uh look at this wound that won't heal got it okay um okay doctor okay grimdahlia is actually near that material as you are walking over there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:41]** No, hey there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** Oh, hi.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:44]** How are you?

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:46]** Can I help you with anything?

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** It's good to meet you.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:50]** Dr. O... Oh, Ocontu?

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:51]** Is that right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:52]** Yeah.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:52]** Oh.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:54]** You can call me Dr. O.K.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:56]** That's what most of my friends call me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** Perfect.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:59]** I'm Grondolia Scarchbear.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:01]** Pleasure to meet you.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** What can I do for you?

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:03]** What can I help you with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:07]** Just, you know, we have a...

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:11]** perhaps a perilous journey ahead of us, much like yourselves.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:13]** surviving down here.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:26]** Well, I was wondering if you had anything I could soup up any of my weapons or my armor just to hopefully protect my oily, thin skin, as it were.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:28]** That's a great question.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:32]** Yes, we do have a bunch of things here.

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:34]** Give me just one second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** Starts to just rummage around.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:39]** You can tell that she's managing everything, but it's loose.

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** There's no one there trying to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:40 - 00:26:05]** take it she's just keeping a rough track in her head of what's going on but there's a there's a there's an organization in the chaos oh yeah you've got some things here how'd you find dinner by the way it's great right she starts to pull some things to show you i uh i thought it was quite good for yeah for a weary traveler like myself


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:09]** There's something that touches your soul.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:13]** Zyra has that ability to just really bring in more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:16]** And the salt-free option, amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:19]** Oh, she is very into that, I have to say.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:21]** So perfect that you are here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:24]** I appreciate her accommodating us.

**[00:26:24 - 00:26:24]** And you.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:27]** Of course.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:30]** So just pleases Punch to be here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:37]** It's rare that you find good people in this universe, especially when you're out trying to be yourself.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:39]** Sometimes you need a little help.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:43]** So I'm always trying to be that helpful people.

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:52]** Anyway, here's some stuff that I think might be good for you and also for your friends, Rick and Colin and Hears.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:53]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:54 - 00:27:00]** So she puts out in front of you a veritable trove

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:19]** especially for you right now of information um i'm gonna i'm gonna put some of this stuff into the chat that we have here um and i will read some of it you can you guys can take a look at we don't need to do all of it right now but i will put it into the chat here

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:24]** You start sifting through it and you think, all right, some of this has ring works on it.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:30]** And it must be like some sort of material that they found here in these homes.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:34]** And some of it might be stuff that they brought with them.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:40]** And it also gets you thinking, all right, what...

**[00:27:41 - 00:27:43]** What was going on here?

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:52]** What was really happening that they had Ringworks here creating some sort of...

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:55]** creating this mine.

**[00:27:55 - 00:28:00]** And now with what here's the starting to learn all this equipment.

**[00:28:01 - 00:28:04]** And of course, whatever I'm trying to post here is literally posting as an image.

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:06]** So, so I can't post it on discord.

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:09]** So I will just put it there for now.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:11]** And then I can send you the full links later.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:31]** You see there is there are two microwave Scorch guns they're made out of this really interesting Material that is unlike anything that you think you've seen before it's very silver and icy and cool It's called sick a tight you recognize it immediately.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:33]** It's like an enhancement to the weapon.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** I've put it in our Starfinder chat and

**[00:28:36 - 00:29:00]** there is a low heat searing grip weapon there is a light excavation laser there is a cylindrical lens pistol a vector gravitron pistol a scoring dross gun a single wave divergent laser

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** There is a brown force field.

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:06]** There are two therm skin ones.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:13]** there is a basic Lashunta temp weave, and there is an Estek suit, too.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:15]** Not one.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** Lashunta temp weave, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:20]** I think that there might be some other stuff here.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:23]** I've been finding some strange things as I've been going through.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:29]** There's also all of these fire opals that we have here that we brought with us.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:34]** So if there's anything, that's been what's the basis of our economy here.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:36]** But, you know, if you need it, you need it.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:37]** Um...

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:43]** And, like I said, if I find anything else, I will certainly put it here and I'll let you know.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** We want to be able to help you out.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:48]** We've used some of this, but we don't have an ease for all of it.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:54]** We're not expecting to be defending ourselves here, although we are certainly trying to stay undercover under wraps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:59]** And she kind of, you know, like taps her eye like, eh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** Here's, you had a question.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** Oh, no.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:06]** Here's just looked, just heard about the... He saw the Lushinta temp weave.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** From across the game.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:11]** Here's is looking at his data pad to look at all the information.

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:14]** I already have Lushinta temp weave, so I'm fine with that.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** Here's is outie.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:17]** Yeah.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:19]** Here's is outie.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** Okay.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** Cool.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** Just putting it out there into the universe.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** All right.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:26]** So, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:29]** Colin, you walk up to Ferex, who is...

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:53]** sitting uh outside his his house where is he on the screen here he was helping out and then he's actually just sitting outside his house right in front you know some people just sit on their stoop on their next to their coffee table sitting a little something wool aperitif and nursing whatever is happening on his leg


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:56]** Hey there, you mind if I have a look at that?

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:59]** I am a doctor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** Kind of just grunts.

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:03]** Puts out his leg.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:05 - 00:31:06]** Awesome.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:12]** Colin puts on his doctor glasses with the little light on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:14]** Colin.

**[00:31:15 - 00:31:22]** You are able to see that in his skin he... Give me a medicine check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:27]** That is a 19 on the die for 31.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:31]** 19 on the die for 31.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:42]** You think to yourself, all right, this is probably some sort of weapon from the city of Rass, from the plane of fire.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:51]** That you don't know what it is, but the damage in it seems to be like it's starting to eat away at his skin, but not like acid or parasite.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:59]** It's like there's some sort of void that is just starting to pull through his legs.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:12]** And you think that it's not so much that you need to like exercise it or get it out, but you think, all right, I, I might've seen something like this in an obscure part of my textbook.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:14]** Because a 31 is pretty powerful.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:20]** You're like, I actually think I might know the concoction to just stay this.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** And this is the aggressor, right?

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:32]** This void damage that's been done is the catalyst that's keeping it churning and multiplying and magnifying and becoming gangrenous, right?

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:34]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:44]** I've seen this once in a book many years ago, but I think I can put together something to at least keep it from getting any worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:45]** Oink!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:46 - 00:33:10]** just takes another sip he's not much one for for words at this moment all right you know do you know where i could find um insert ingredient list yeah you you go back to where uh the um tent is which is over here on the right the tent where all the medical equipment is and you start to uh are are you guys on the map

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:35]** nope no cool wow i didn't realize that from the beginning this whole time like 25 minutes we're all just playing in the mind like yeah cool love it love it appreciate y'all you're on the map now uh cool cool yeah so uh so there's a there's a tent off to the bottom left here the four tents that seems to be the medical tent there's a little bed where they can lay on and other accoutrement for


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:35 - 00:33:38]** Where is Dr. Okay in this now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** Dr. Okay is right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:41]** Is he by the tents on the other sides?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:47]** Yeah, he's here, but I'll move you over to where Grumdahlia is in this tent there.

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:51]** And I'll say that Lydia is over here.

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:58]** So Grumdahlia, of the four tents, they're kind of two on one side of the ridge, two on the other.

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:01]** Grumdahlia and Dr. O'Kay are on the top right.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:06]** And Lydia and Colin, you can walk over there and get whatever you need.

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:09]** Yeah?

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:12]** Dr. O'Kay is going to take the...

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:18]** Ask Bernice to let me see your pistol there, Bernice.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:19]** Yeah.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:22]** Is that transmutation matrix, right?

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:22]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:51]** so like could i and i can clone any weapon or does it destroy the weapon it i know it clones it it does clone it but then she uses it yeah and i think it takes a day so let me just one let me make a note about that um i forgot you had that thing yeah yeah well bernice has that thing and it comes in plenty handy and if i can i hate to retire the knife but having that searing grip


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:57]** and a cylindrical lens pistol would make Bernice pretty freaking awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:57 - 00:35:01]** Do you tell the other players about the, or your companions about the other stuff, too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** Yeah, guys.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:07]** Hey, there's some wares here that we might benefit from.

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:18]** I see a few long arms, and I'm going to perhaps do some tinkering of my own on this weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:30]** display this bevy of of fine goods yeah you uh you do need upbs okay and uh

**[00:35:31 - 00:36:01]** it yeah i can send you the the doc on this afterwards um and you do have to do a engineering or life science on it it takes about four hours um oh sorry no no no that's to upgrade it uh yeah so it can it takes about an hour to change it through into something else um it's a small arm of items levels one through three of light bulk or less so it's an advanced melee weapon or a small arm of items levels one through three


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** Um, can I upgrade it to accommodate level four?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** Yes, but that takes a bit longer.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** That takes four hours.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:10]** So that can be something that you start to work on and that takes an injury on that.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:10]** Okay, cool.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:12]** Love it.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** Love it.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** Okay.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:15]** So maybe you do that.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:19]** Do you claim one of the like apartments that you claim to?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:23]** Cause I'm going to, cause I can, it switches between two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:23]** Oh yeah.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:24]** Sorry.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** I meant the apartments on the side.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** Like, do you like go start to work there?

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** Where do you work?

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:44]** Yeah, I'm going to take one of those two of those items and I kind of want to leave like the force field for Rick or any any other tank in the party.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:53]** Yeah, but I'm going to take and here's you can have my temp weave if I can throw on this Aztec suit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** Yeah, I mean, I think all... What's that now?

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:57]** Are we talking about armor here?

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** He's like, what?

**[00:36:59 - 00:36:59]** Yeah.

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:01]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:03]** Well, thank you, doctor.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:09]** I'm very excited to get back up there just doing some computering down here, but I'll be up in a moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** Yeah.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:21]** Well, stop by my place after I... I mean, there's also a temp weave here, but I think the Aztec suit too is better.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** It's pretty good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** The therm skins are pretty good too.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** And there might be more.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:28]** Gromda, I said, if she finds more and you all ever look for more, then maybe there's more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:32]** Yeah, do you mind if I take these for a few hours?

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:40]** I'm going to do some tinkering and I might come back with some more stuff and take a look at what you can find, Gromaldia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** Yeah, of course.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:46]** If I find anything else, then I'll go ahead and let you know.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:48]** That's not a problem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:53]** So I'm gonna take these things and I'm gonna go to my makeshift.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:54]** Humble abode.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:55]** Humble abode.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:58]** I'm just gonna pick the first one I see.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:01]** I love it.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** And, uh, get to tinkering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:02]** Of course.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:04]** Dr. K takes some time to be like, hold on.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:06]** Let me, let me, let me keep researching.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:07]** I'm always trying to research.

**[00:38:07 - 00:38:08]** I was trying to figure out what's going on.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:14]** You start working on it and I'll get you those rules in a sec.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** Let's, let's check back, check back in with Rick 19.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:16]** Okay.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** He tells you about the tattoo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:23]** PD says, Oh, I'm more than willing to help out with the tattoo.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:23]** Uh,

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:26]** Anyway, it's getting a little late.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:31]** I think it might be good to retire.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:33]** Is there anything else that I can help you with?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:35 - 00:38:37]** I am just curious.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:40]** What is yours, your plans now?

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:44]** Do you intend to leave this planet now that you've escaped the sauna?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** I don't know.

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:50]** I imagine that at some point we may encounter Rudy.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:57]** Rudy is a friend to the Azers here, and I will have to face that moment when it comes.

**[00:38:58 - 00:39:01]** I don't wish to go back to the sauna, nor do I think Del does either.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:05]** But I will find out.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:09]** They're a good community, and I would like to help them.

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:17]** As you know, we are tasked with helping and saving those who often cannot do that themselves.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:21]** And I think it might be good to spend some more time here with them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:23]** I wish I could say the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:29]** Aye, it has been very pleasant talking with you.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:34]** I'm sure we'll speak again, but it's nice to have a new friend here.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:35]** Same.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** You all start walking back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:38]** Here's.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:45]** Actually, first, Colin, do you want to give me a quick medicine check to see if you can hear Ferrix?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:49]** No, but I'll give you a slow, smooth medicine check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:49]** Nice.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** Slow, smooth, fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:55]** Slow, smooth, fast.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:55]** It's a 13.

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:55]** Okay.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:56]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:57 - 00:40:15]** yeah it you think that that this is going to need some time you're able to to get it okay for the moment he's he's like he sips a lot while you're drinking and then he's able to you think that you're going to need to check back in on this later cool yeah it was a one on the dive for 13.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** It's all good.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** It's all good.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:26]** It's not bad, but it's a, it's a pretty good role for, despite a one, he actually, as, as you're patching them up and you tell him that, that he, he'll need some more care soon.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:35]** Um, he pulls a glass seemingly out of nowhere and, uh, pours a little bit extra and invites you to just sit for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:37]** Just, Oh, just vibe, you know?

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** Yes.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:38]** Yeah.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** Immediately.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:39]** Yes.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:40]** Yeah.

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:42]** It's Benny's love language anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** For calling them.

**[00:40:45 - 00:41:15]** here's you start looking through and there is a bevy of information you you find a lot of files of personal files of individuals that it seems like this was an off the books operation

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:30]** Not a black site per se, but just an not on any, anyone's radar, except those who are meant to, uh, meant to know some people were very excited to be here.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** Some people were very loath to be here.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:38]** They weren't looking for whatever this red crystal is.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:41]** This is an interesting change.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** You find that out immediately.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:58]** and then you're not quite sure what they were looking for and you realize that not everyone there knew what they were looking for so ringwork sets up this off the books under the radar operation doesn't tell

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:03]** anyone with files that you're reading, what's going on.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:11]** But they seem to employ all these Azers and Shireen to do the digging and the mining.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:15]** And you think, okay, well, I know Azers and Shireen can withstand a lot of heat,

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:23]** That's how, you know, it seems like Mirko mentioned that that they came here through some sort of plane travel.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:32]** And from what she was telling you, they had to withstand some pretty extreme heat just to get through and make their way up here.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:41]** So you think, all right, so they specifically hired individuals, you know, like who species wise can can handle this task.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:43]** And you start to move through time.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:45]** People are getting disgruntled.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:47]** They're not sure why they're working.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:50]** Even the people who were originally excited to be here and try something new.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** They're getting upset.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:58]** A lot of the leaders keep pushing them harder and harder.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:02]** And you see threads of...

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:13]** Maybe like insurrection, threads of violence, threads of like, I don't want to be here anymore.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:17]** And there's pushback from the senior leadership.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:22]** You see that after a while, it starts to bubble up.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:28]** Especially after it seems like there's one individual.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:33]** They keep referencing this one individual that they call the brand.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:39]** And they are somebody you do not want to mess with.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:45]** There's violence.

**[00:43:45 - 00:43:47]** It bubbles, boils over.

**[00:43:48 - 00:44:08]** Seemingly, the Azers and Shireen make some sort of a sabotage of the equipment, some attempt to just cut off the whole operation that involves significant damage, explosions, tech.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:14]** And you see the acknowledgement in some of the words that are written here.

**[00:44:16 - 00:44:37]** You think some of these final letters that I'm seeing are, um, acknowledgement that what they're about to do, they may not be able to survive, but they are able to at least set some people free or they're able to take what was at, at first glance was a great opportunity and quickly became a hellscape literally.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:43]** And they've sent those off to their loved ones, hoping that they'll see them soon.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** If they did, you don't know.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:59]** Maybe you can ask that the users here know anything, but you think that whatever happened caused this, what would have been otherwise a perfectly working mind site to become.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:04]** severely cracked, eroded, damaged.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:08]** And you think, well, this crystal growth must have happened afterwards.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:10]** And that's why this platform is barely surviving.

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:18]** That's why none of this is really functional or working at all.

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:30]** Maybe that explains why there was this shift up on the surface where half of the things dropped and moved away, and they literally moved the moon and the mantle and the crust in order to make some of these things go away.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:35]** Not to hide it, but just to break free.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:41]** The people that were running this place, what were they?

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:43]** They weren't Azers or were they Azers?

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** They weren't Azers.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:46]** I know the Azers were an employee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:53]** The Azers in the stream were in the employee and you think that they were Ringworks senior leaders?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** Just generally like Ringworks senior managers.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** Okay.

**[00:45:57 - 00:46:03]** So then it's possible that the Azers that are here currently were involved in this uprising, this worker uprising that happened here.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:04]** Yeah.

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:05]** Very likely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:19]** maybe okay maybe or yeah i mean maybe it was noted that one of them knew somebody and that's why they came here when they sought to escape and they needed a place to go this is where they were able to go because the city is on a different plane

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:46]** here's can't be sure that any of the remaining individuals were involved in this like coup right yeah it doesn't seem like it and when they were talking it didn't seem like they were like no one brought that up you know you think that from what you saw from from what you saw whatever magma flow overflow overload that they caused took a lot of lives here i see here's gonna write a summary of all the data that he found okay um and then uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:54]** And then with a note that says, like, it's unlikely that the current Azers were involved, but keep an eye out.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:56]** And then he sends it to everyone's data pads.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:58]** Are you going to write that in the notes?

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** I'm not going to write it in the notes.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** You were writing it in the notes, weren't you?

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** You're going to take my summary of what?

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:14]** Okay, got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** There is something else as you're going through.

**[00:47:17 - 00:47:21]** you realize that you didn't get through some of the hidden files that you saw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:22]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** Let's do that.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:35]** Ringworks was looking for some sort of... You've tapped into one of the junior senior leaders, let's call them, right?

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:38]** Like the deputies, not anyone there.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:44]** They were looking for something unusual in the crust, any sort of abnormality.

**[00:47:46 - 00:48:02]** including a history of the planet, any sort of impacts, any sort of terrestrial understanding of what astronomical events have happened here.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:07]** And you see that they're

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** Well, let's say this.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:11]** Here's give me a physical science check.

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:19]** If you're sharing this with anybody, if you start to come back up and talk with anybody, then they can also give a physical science check and you can look over it together.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** But otherwise, it's just you doing it all.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:21]** Here's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:23]** Okay.

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:25]** Well, for now, here's we'll do it at 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:26 - 00:48:28]** Get up and consult where it needs to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:28]** Okay.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:30]** So you're looking at this as you walk up.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:33]** I'll say that you're able to get up again without hurting yourself.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:35]** You know that that piece of metal is there.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** Astrogeologists...

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:41]** who maybe there's one or two who were helped surveying the site.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:49]** They, they found this area to be consistent of rocks that are pre gap.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:54]** Okay.

**[00:48:54 - 00:49:00]** And it's localized to this area, maybe this whole crater that you came in originally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** And you look and see- Localized as if it's only here.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:05]** Sorry to interrupt.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:08]** Like only in this area did they have this pre-bag rock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** Yeah.

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:12]** And maybe it spreads out, but they didn't have a mine.

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:13]** Maybe they did a little surveying.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:16]** You think, all right, it could have been here and here.

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:18]** There are some more fragments.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:27]** But going down as deep as we've gone, we're seeing the stratification, the layers of rock and impacts that have hit this moon for eons.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:28]** Yeah.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:33]** And they find rock that, according to their records, they think some of this is pre-gap.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:37]** And you see these minute fragments.

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:51]** They verify it by seeing that there are some fragments that weren't heated as long as usual, but their structure is unchanged.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:54]** So it's like they've been around...

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:58]** before Varos was a Lava Moon?

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:06]** There was a list of minerals that they were looking through.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:19]** And maybe as you're sending this or reading this, Dr. O'Kay, in your mind, you're thinking, I saw those microwave scorch guns that weren't made out of any normal material that I've seen.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:24]** It's like a class S. I don't know if it's class S. It's called scicotite.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:26]** That's the enhancement to the weapon.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:32]** Um, that when it's a sick of tight weapon, then what does that do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:34]** It's a, it's a microwave.

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:36]** It's a scorch gun microwave.

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:36]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:43]** So there's S band and then there's like K band C band X band.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:44]** Yeah.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** I'll need to look and see what that is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:53]** Um, I just, I was just focused on telling it here's it deeply affects how awesome this weapon is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** It's the microwave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** It's the cheap one.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** Yeah.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:59]** That's the, yeah, that's the, that's the first one.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:12]** Um, but it's made of psychotite, which when added to psychotite, it deals an extra fire damage, uh,

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:33]** an extra point of damage um so like sick of tight itself when found naturally plus one right per six item levels right and so as you you can increase the item level and you can deal more damage so yeah um sick of tight itself is incredibly cold

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:49]** Until it is exposed to extreme heat at which point it becomes incredibly hot it is either one or the other So to switch between the two is more or less a very semi-permanent process And so you have to heat it for or cool it for a very long time so they are

**[00:51:49 - 00:52:06]** these objects are pretty immune to fire damage and heat so it makes sense that this is probably a weapon used specifically for trying to break down anything that was here or anything that they might want to use in order to heat up because this one is sick of tight for fire damage

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:10]** And maybe you're wondering why that's here.

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:19]** And here's separately, you're reading the answer, which is that they were looking for these other materials, that they were looking for all these minerals and different things.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:23]** And they kept coming up short.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:30]** And you maybe start to put two and two together, you start to see the other side of this, that these senior leaders were facing deadlines and unable to meet goals.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:43]** And they also received a strange thing is that they received these unusual visits from local stewards checking in on what they were doing.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:59]** And also visits from groups that people that they had no idea who they were, including these two individuals who seem to be brother and sister.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:28]** there is some sort of curious information about one piece of red crystal that they found but the file is corrupted after that you don't know and you think huh maybe this this crystal is what they're they were referring to a particular red crystal among these red crystals

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:32]** Yeah, there's enough there that you think, oh, maybe they found something here.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:37]** Maybe something that they did here caused this.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:44]** Maybe there's some connection between what they did, what the uprising did, and this growth of crystal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:48]** Oh, okay.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** Kiers makes another summary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:51]** And sends it out to everybody.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:54]** There's one more thing.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:58]** Give me a culture or a mysticism check.

**[00:53:58 - 00:54:03]** Here's, and again, if you want anybody else to see it, you would share with them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Uh, all right.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:05]** Well,

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** Okay.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Well, how can I do that?

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:10]** Like, am I near?

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** I'm not near everyone.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:12]** Where am I?

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** So I'm back up here.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:16]** So I guess I can go close to Rick because I know Dr. OK is busy.

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:20]** I'm moving you up here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** I just moved you up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:27]** He'll kind of gather them around and be like, hey, team only huddle, please.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:32]** And he looks at this like red forge chief and he's like, I'm a chef, I suppose.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** He's like, I'm sorry if you don't mind.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:36]** I just need to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:50]** my patriots real quick okay so go go away actually i guess we'll yeah we'll go to this tent yeah yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** Much appreciated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** Ferrix.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:55]** She kind of grunts.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:59]** I didn't try their food yet, but I'm definitely going to need that help.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:05]** I'm guessing you're on comms, Dr. K, because you're working on stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** Yeah.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:07]** Hey, what's up?

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:13]** I'm going to need some help with this because I can't quite.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:16]** I mean, his mysticism is good, but he rolled a fucking one.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** So plus 12 is 13.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:22]** So I'm going to need some help figuring this out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:24]** Colin rolled a 24 for mysticism.

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:25]** 24 for mysticism.

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:28]** Okay.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:28]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:29]** Okay.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:30]** Let's do this.

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:31]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:33]** You're working on this stuff.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:36]** Maybe at one point you're taking a break because you're doing pretty well.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:42]** I'm going to assume as we can do it off air, but I think you're doing pretty well working with the living transmutation matrix.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:46]** It's been a few days really, since you were there almost a week, right?

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** Since you first programmed it, you're like, Oh, that's right.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:50]** Take, take a look back at it.

**[00:55:52 - 00:56:02]** maybe you, as you're, you're taking a break for a second, you pop open the book that you found that was in the Stuser when you first got it, right?

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:14]** It was the, it was the, it was the book from Dr. Uh, if you recall, it was the one that said gene therapy design and prospects of breath through subdermal regeneration methods.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:17]** And, uh,

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:25]** It has this handwriting on the inside that says, Rel, I would be delighted to see your face in Roselight anytime.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** Dr. Navinci.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:34]** And you remember Dr. Navinci was the same name of a doctor that wrote something with Dr. Brudakis.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:40]** You start thumbing through two things.

**[00:56:42 - 00:56:42]** You...

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:48]** As you take a second to learn, maybe Bernice is processing.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:49]** She's just uploading stuff from the weapon.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:51]** So you have a few minutes.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:59]** You realize that there is an extreme amount of pretty esoteric information here about this.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:04]** This was a literature review.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** And there's some stuff in here that you think, wow, this is really interesting.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:15]** This is like new ways of thinking about gene therapy and DNA structures and RNA structures that I didn't ever know before.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:40]** And I'm going to say that from here on out, you're going to get a, a plus two to any sort of medicine check or life science check that has to do with DNA, gene therapy, RNA therapy, like pretty complex stuff because of the ideas that are in that you're like, Oh, I, it sparks something in you.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** It sparks like a,

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:51]** I remember feeling this way when I was doing research back on, you know, back in Javon, when I was like, when I was really just studying, like it, it, it brings out that side of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:56]** Very fallout ask, read a book and get a plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:57 - 00:58:02]** Um, you also notice that there's this, there's a particular article.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:05]** It's really interesting of somebody also on Rose light.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:10]** Their name is Dr. Flo Morocco in the sibling.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:38]** i'll put it in the chat here and it seems like that was the that that was the piece of information that that really just like sunk in that's that's that's what puts you over that edge that that grabbed you and seems like they have a really keen mind for this exact thing as you're reading that doctor okay let's go let's jump back to here's colin and rick

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:45]** 26 on the mysticism check, 13 on the check from here, right?

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:49]** There's a file in this.

**[00:58:50 - 00:59:02]** As you're jumping through, looking at the different trees of documents and reports and everything, there's a name that keeps coming up.

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:04]** It's Aeon Star number six.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** And you think to yourself, what is...

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:11]** What is the Aeon?

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:14]** What is Aeon star number six?

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:26]** And if you think back to your Pathfinder history, you recall that there was...

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:48]** earthfall right i think we talked about this when you all found that book in the uh what do you call it in tirkal space right earthfall was this cataclysmic event of meteors right that totally that was meant to wipe out the planet and didn't

**[00:59:48 - 01:00:18]** and was broken up there are a lot of theories about why it's broken up but you do you're you're pretty certain that at some point in the history um some some gods were involved to protect galarian and the comet originally hit the gods before totally obliterating on actual galarian right so they in a way saved galarian by stepping in front of that comet

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:24]** And then you think, well, what's the Aeon Star?

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:34]** And you remember that that was the name of the weapon or the comment.

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:43]** or whatever it was that was headed before it broke up before it hit part of a God or a moon or whatever it is before it broke up and then landed.

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:46]** That's, that's the name that's been given to it.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:53]** It's been called the Aeon star, the name of the comment that was headed towards.

**[01:00:55 - 01:01:00]** It's at that moment.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:05]** That everyone around you starts running for a split second.

**[01:01:05 - 01:01:08]** People just are like, they hear something that you don't hear.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:14]** And they run into their houses.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:18]** Rick hears Colin, you look up.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:21]** Mirko walks over to you.

**[01:01:24 - 01:01:27]** She puts her hands on her lips.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:33]** She's telling you to be very quiet and then you all start to hear it.

**[01:01:33 - 01:01:39]** There's a, like a subtle vibration.

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:51]** And you think to yourself, is there, is there something in the earth or in the moon?

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:57]** Dr. O'Kay, the water in your glass starts to move.

**[01:01:58 - 01:01:59]** Jurassic Park.

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:04]** You said Mirko put her hand to her lips?

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:06]** Uh-huh.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** Similar to Nixon Cairo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:08]** No.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** To be quiet?

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:12]** Yeah, just to be quiet.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:17]** and you all feel it and you start thinking in your head, what, what, what is causing this?

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:20]** You think, well, I'm not that far underground.

**[01:02:20 - 01:02:21]** I walked for a while, but it was a gentle slope.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:29]** So maybe it's like a hundred feet or something, but there's, there's some, there's some vibration.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:30 - 01:02:35]** Are they, are they, is anybody looking towards the entrance or are they looking elsewhere?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:37]** They're looking elsewhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:02:39 - 01:02:39]** Okay.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:43]** Are they looking in the same direction?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:43 - 01:02:44]** No.
