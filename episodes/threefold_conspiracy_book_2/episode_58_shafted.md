**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Previously on Will Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:15]** With the squealing, scramming after tangling with our troopers, our band of brothers bring their attention back to the computers to reveal additional doorways, including one curious entry not on the map.

**[00:00:15 - 00:00:28]** After opening the hidden door, the crew discovers a hollow emitter near Bernice, revealing some familiar faces, including the same picture of Professor Benjam and a Rhyphorian at a Triaxian dig site.

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:35]** But a curious oddity is observed as we see our very own Hears dressed in a suit surrounded by adoring supporters.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:40]** Is this fantastic following a forewarning of a fiend in our mists?

**[00:00:41 - 00:00:45]** Or is this fantasy another foul gray trick to tear the team apart?

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on Will Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:43]** Welcome to episode 58.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:49]** Where for no apparent reason, we're doing a brunch recording.

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** Brunch?

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:51]** Because why not?

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:53]** We'll save the brunch.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:54]** No relation to the number 58.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:57]** But just a good time.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Maybe one day we'll have to do this.

**[00:01:58 - 00:01:59]** Some mimosas.

**[00:02:00 - 00:02:01]** Yeah, some mimosas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:03]** Brunch for you guys is 3 p.m.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:04]** for me.

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]** You mean 2.30, Kev?

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]** Dude, brunch extends to 2.30.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:11]** Brunch can be as long as you want it to be.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:11]** Yeah.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** I disagree.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** No.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** Because then it becomes lunch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:21]** Because you live in Maryland and stuff where people care about, like the sun sets early and people are like, ah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:21]** Well, no.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:23]** Time travel aside.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:24]** Time travel aside.

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:29]** Time traveling aside, breakfast is until like 10 to 11.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:33]** Brunch is from like 10 to 1 at the most.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:36]** Because lunch is like 12 on, for sure.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:38]** I like 11 o'clock lunches.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:39]** No, no.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** What I meant was culturally.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:41]** Yeah, culturally.

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** Because right now.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** You can have brunch whenever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:46]** I can have brunch starting at 1.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:49]** And it'll go into 4 o'clock until my dinner.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** You sound like a Best Western schedule, Kev.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:55]** You sound like a Best Western schedule where breakfast is 6 a.m.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:56]** to 8 a.m.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:57]** Oh, I hate that.

**[00:02:58 - 00:03:01]** I hate when Best Western is like, you got complimentary breakfast.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** Only for one hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:04]** What is this, McDonald's?

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** Am I trying to order a sausage, biscuit, and egg?

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:06]** Yes.

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** At 10.05?

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:08]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:11]** There goes our Best Western sponsor.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:11]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Goodbye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:12]** Oh, no.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** Screw Best Western.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:17]** They'll be like, you get complimentary breakfast, but it ends at 8.30 a.m.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** Good luck.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** Come on, dude.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** Good luck.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** No one's going to be up on vacation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:27]** You get there at 8.15, and the only thing that's left is white bread and bananas.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:27]** That's it.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** That's bulls**t. Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:31]** Have you thought that most people who travel don't travel for vacation?

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:31]** Even so.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:33]** Yeah, they travel for business.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:33]** Yeah.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:38]** And if you work for a business, you should already be on the road to get where you're supposed to be by now.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:38]** Okay, Kev.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:38]** Wow, Kev.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** That's an impressive life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** Just say it.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:41]** Yeah.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:41]** Look, we get it.

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** You just had a business trip.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:44]** You know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** Good.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** Your coffee and your muffin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:46]** We get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:47]** You went to USC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:50]** Back to this.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:57]** For those who don't know, Will has a longstanding hatred of USC.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** I don't have a hatred against anyone.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:01]** And alumni, present company included.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:02]** So it's fine.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:10]** I'm just remarking and opining on the habits of our friend Kevin here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:12]** Well, this is going to make you guys giggle.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:18]** The fact that I'm such an early bird, I used to book all my classes.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:20]** I'd do the 7 o'clock classes.

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:21]** Those were my favorite ones.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:24]** You're such an early bird, dude.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** Kevin, you're so weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:27]** I don't know.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:30]** I like being up early and getting things done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:33]** I agree with that, but also, like, I don't know.

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:40]** Kev was like, why don't we record, and us on the West Coast will record at 8 a.m., and Kev will record at 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:49]** I honestly wish we were swapped, because then you guys can record late, I can record early, and then, bam, good to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:50]** Yeah, that would be nice.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:52]** Except then I would have to live on the East Coast.

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:55]** Not that I have anything against the East Coast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** I just don't want to live there.

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:58]** I mean, yeah.

**[00:04:59 - 00:05:01]** Give clams around there, right?

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** And lobsters and stuff.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** Just chill in the water.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:06]** Maryland's the crab state.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:08]** It was snowing this morning.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:09]** I was so excited because it rained all day yesterday.

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:12]** In March.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:14]** Yeah, in March.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** It's snowing.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** Oh, my God.

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:19]** It's terrible.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** We're still time traveling here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** Wow.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:26]** Wait, so back to the topic of brunch and when it should be.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** It's official accepted limits.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** Kev, when do you eat dinner?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** 5.36.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:39]** Okay, so I think that excludes you from the conversation of whether brunch should be, you know... Why is that weird?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:40]** That is dinner time.

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:41]** Are you an old man?

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:43]** I didn't say 4 o'clock.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:47]** Are you trying to get a senior's discount at Crack Barrel?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:47]** I think he is.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:49]** Pryor, get out of here.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** I love Cracker Barrel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:52]** I love Cracker Barrel, too.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:54]** My life is regimented.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:59]** You say, oh boy, oh boy, I get to have my spinach and blah, blah, blah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:59 - 00:06:00]** That's right.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** You just eat that at 5.30.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:02]** My cream curd.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:06]** By 6 o'clock, Grayson goes to take a bath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** 6.30, he's in bed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:09]** You could eat dinner after.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:15]** Kevin's like, well, I guess I'll just have a nightcap with some sherry and then I'll go to bed at 7 p.m.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:19]** And just like Will, he also has a gown and a cap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** Exactly.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:25]** And then you read your Victorian books.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:27]** I have a flap that I can shit out of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:33]** I've been watching...

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:36]** I don't know if you know the show Married at First Sight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:39]** Our friends just recommended that to us.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** It sounds terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:49]** It's terrible, but one of the only reality shows that I really enjoy because some of these people are genuinely trying to create a real marriage.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:51]** It's not just to be crazy.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:55]** It's to actually have a successful relationship come out of this whole experience.

**[00:06:56 - 00:07:01]** And you kind of learn a lot of things by watching these other people go through their...

**[00:07:01 - 00:07:03]** create a relationship and why things work.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:14]** And they have experts who talk to him about that, like real relationship experts and a pastor and a sex therapist that like they all talk about what's making your relationship work and not work.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:21]** But the interesting thing is that there's one couple and the dude wears a nightgown to bed and it is huge.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:23]** Like you can barely see his feet.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** And I saw that and I was like,

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:25]** That's kind of cool.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** And he's like, hour eight.

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** It was great.

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:31]** It was awesome.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:32]** Amazing.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:33]** I support that.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:36]** Look up Bennett Nightgown, Married at First Sight.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:39]** And if you're a fan and are on that season, don't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** I'm not going to Google that anyways.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** Who knows what will pop up when you do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:45]** Bennett Nightgown, Married at First Sight.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** Bennett Nightgown, Married at First Sight.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:48]** Yeah, it's good stuff.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** Great show.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:53]** Great, easy watching to get involved in people's lives.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** It's just a giant shirt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:57]** It's a knight shirt.

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:01]** It's like an XXXL shirt that he stretches below his feet like a toddler.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:02]** That's totally weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:05]** Wait, does he have like a whole closet full of these things?

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:07]** Or does he wear the same one all the time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:08]** It seems to be the same one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:10]** That's his knight dress.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** It's a nightgown.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:16]** This guy is like, you described him as like anachronistic, but actually he looks literally insane.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** He is.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** He has like another picture.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** He's very quirky.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:19]** He's very quirky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:22]** He looks a little weird.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:27]** The person that he was matched with is also equally as weird and their relationship is very quirky.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** It's awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:29]** What?

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** What is this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:32]** I don't like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:37]** My nightgown is way more sophisticated.

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** I'll bet it is.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** He's got a flap.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** I have a flap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:44]** What is the purpose for this nightgown that he has?

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** It's just a giant t-shirt.

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** That's not a nightgown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** Yeah, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:49]** Whatever.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** He treats it like one, I guess.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** Yeah.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:52]** Is it like sentimental?

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** He's just a child.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** Never, man.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:54]** And a man.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:57]** Now you're going to make me watch the show to find out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:00]** Kevin's such an old man that he's gatekeeping what nightgowns should look like.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:01]** That's right.

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:02]** That's what's happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:02]** By definition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:04]** By definition.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:05]** By technicality.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:07]** I'm going to Google the definition of nightgown.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** It doesn't say a t-shirt.


## Speaker_0

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:09]** What?

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:33]** wow kev i know someone who no imagination i like google nightgown like the first thing that shows up is exactly what this dude is wearing perfect if you the definition of nightgown according to free dictionary on google is a light loose garment worn by a woman or child in bed


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:35]** Wait, not a man?

**[00:09:35 - 00:09:37]** That's what it says.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:37]** That's weird.

**[00:09:37 - 00:09:40]** What do they call men's night clothes or something?

**[00:09:40 - 00:09:42]** Yeah, like night garb.

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:44]** Men's version of night gown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** Dressing gown.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:46]** Archaic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:47]** Pajamas.

**[00:09:47 - 00:09:49]** PJs, yeah.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** I mean, that's what I wear is pajamas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:52]** What is the etymology of pajamas now?

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:52]** I'm curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:53]** I think it's Indian.

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:56]** Maybe.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:56]** That's cool.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:57]** Okay.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:00]** I can't find what men's nightgowns are called, but I can look up the origin of pajama.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:01]** Ah, yes.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:09]** It is borrowed in English in 1800s from the Hindu Dastani Pajama.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** That's awesome.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** I like that.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** That's cool.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:15]** Thank you to our listeners for putting up with us as we discover new things on the internet.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:17]** That's what we're going to do for the next hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** That's it.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** And that's episode 58.

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:21]** Cut all of this, please.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** No, no, no.

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:23]** It's all good.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:26]** This is useless discussion that no one wants to hear.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:28]** We've had worse intros.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:29]** People are learning things.

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:31]** I feel like this is better.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:37]** At least it's tight and it's funny and we learned, our audience learned, we all laughed, we all loved it.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** It was a good time.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:40]** A good time was had by all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:53]** Did you know that apparently during World War II there was rationing of pajama material for British children?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:53 - 00:10:56]** Oh, well, that's depressing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:56 - 00:10:57]** During World War II.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:57]** That's sad.

**[00:10:58 - 00:10:59]** They couldn't wear nightgowns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:00]** Yeah, they had to wear them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** Because they were children.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:01]** Yep.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:04]** Well, that's the definition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:05]** It's a definition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:09]** I'm reading so much now, and this is just going to become a podcast about pajamas.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** That I would listen to.

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:12 - 00:11:13]** Wait, what's your best pajamas?

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:16]** I have one that's like sled dogs on them.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:17]** Oh, sled dogs is cool.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:20]** There's a reason for it that I'll explain another time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:24]** I have a set of pajamas that's like very loose fitting.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:25]** It's like a gi.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:27]** I've seen that.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:29]** That's nice.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:29]** That's smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** It's really nice.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:31]** I have a Batman onesie.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** That's kind of my favorite.

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:34]** Do you sleep in that every night?

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:36]** No, I don't sleep in pajamas most of the time.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** I usually just sleep in my boxers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:37]** Yeah, same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** But you still have your onesie?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:41]** But sometimes I wear like spicy pepper pants.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:41]** Those are cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:42]** That is good.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:44]** Kevin, wait, you have your onesie still?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:45]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:46]** It's an adult size onesie.

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:47]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:49]** Do you not have a butt flap on your onesie?

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** No, there's no flaps.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** Then it's not a nightgown.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:53]** Yeah, it's not a nightgown.

**[00:11:53 - 00:11:54]** It's not a onesie.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** It does have a cape, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:58]** Well, if you would like to send Kevin a little nightgown.

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** I need to send you some pajamas, Kevin.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:01]** I think we need wholesale PJs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:01]** I have plenty of pajamas.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** I just don't wear them.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:06]** I have some moose pants, pajama pants.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:11]** I have some blue camouflage, you know, like navy blue camouflage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** For when you're swimming in your PJs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:12]** Yeah.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:16]** I have some Marvel ones that are really nice because they're like silky.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:20]** I got a good collection of pajama pants.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:21]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:23]** Now you can watch Married at First Sight with them.

**[00:12:24 - 00:12:25]** At 6 p.m.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:27]** when your bedtime starts.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:27]** That's right.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** Perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:37]** I like John's comment about the camouflage pajamas being used to be camouflaged in some way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Swimming.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:45]** They don't do it any longer, but the Navy actually has had blue digital camo uniforms, and I love them.

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:50]** I still have my Gore-Tex jacket I wear it out in the rain and snow because it's just good material.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** But, um...

**[00:12:51 - 00:13:00]** The original thought from it, at least the rumor, the myth, was that it's blue camo, but when it gets wet, it's supposed to turn bright orange.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:04]** So if you were to fall overboard, your blue camis would turn orange.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:08]** And apparently it was just way too expensive, and they stopped doing that right away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** So they just kept it blue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:11]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:12]** I love it.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:15]** And then you got lost.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:20]** To blend into the exterior of your naval submarine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:25]** Yeah, I'm not going to defend the thought process that went into that besides the orange change.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:25]** You know what?

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:27]** The Florida in me loves it.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:30]** The Florida in me just wants to wear camo a lot, so I'm fine with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:37]** Well, now the Navy and I think every branch shares the same, like, woodland theme.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:37]** Yeah.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:42]** So, like, the Space Force and the Navy all wear, like... For all the trees in space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:42 - 00:13:43]** It's so weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:44]** Green-brown.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:48]** What's you just sitting on a... To save money or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:52]** Yeah, I think, like, just a general uniform for all branches or something.

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:57]** You know, by the time this airs, it's going to be completely different, so it doesn't matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:03]** Good, because I don't think that Navy people should be standing on a carrier in, like, woodland camo.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:04]** They do, though.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** They do now, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:08]** Get it together, U.S.

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:08]** government.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:08 - 00:14:11]** Like, spend money on people, too.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** Yeah, they should be wearing Navy blues.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:13]** Digital blues.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:15]** You know what they need to do.

**[00:14:15 - 00:14:17]** Invest in our podcasts.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** Listen to us.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:19]** We'll be good to go.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:22]** We'll solve all those problems.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:22 - 00:14:27]** We're going to actually put out a poll where you can vote on what we should be wearing.

**[00:14:27 - 00:14:30]** Whether it's nightgowns or digital blue camis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:32]** That is a poll that is going to go up.

**[00:14:32 - 00:14:34]** I'm holding us to it right now.

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:36]** That is going to go up.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:37]** It has to.

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** March 9th, yeah.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:43]** And with that, I think we should play.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:45]** Let's play.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:53]** It's been a doozy of a couple episodes these past couple episodes.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:59]** Doozy of information and new things happening.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** Where's my music that I like to play during this recap?

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:02]** There it is.

**[00:15:03 - 00:15:09]** So in the last few hours aboard this place, you have...

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:16]** discovered the resting area of Greys, including their peculiarities.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:17]** I think that's a word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:20]** We didn't find any, though, because if we did, they'd probably be in nightgowns.

**[00:15:20 - 00:15:22]** They'd probably be in nightgowns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** Yeah, they probably wear gray camo.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** White camo, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** And then they're just stripped naked.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:32]** That's why we saw that one just lying all naked.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:34]** Yep, that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:35]** Yeah, he was really just tired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** Well, their pajamas are actually very secret.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:40]** So anytime they die, they remove the pajamas.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:43]** Secrets don't get out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:46]** Is it like special superpower pajamas?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** That's right.

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** Probably.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:51]** I kind of want to see if Galactic Magic has pajamas.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:53]** I want Paizo to write magic pajamas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:57]** Very thankful of Galactic Magic, by the way.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** Yeah, that's correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:03]** I know we might be spending too much time talking about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:06]** Now that the recap is about pajamas.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:07]** Yeah, Paizo Pajamas.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** I'm Googling it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** Paizo Pajamas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:11]** If it doesn't exist, I'm going to petition to get it done.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:13]** Anyways, back to the sleeping greys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:17]** You also recognize that they had these peculiarities.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:17]** That's a tough word to say.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** Of saving these knickknacks.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:21]** Right?

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:28]** Then you discover these computers that confirm what the stewards were saying.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:31]** That the reactors are going to...

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:35]** I'm gonna blow, I'm gonna sanitize, something's gonna happen.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** And it's pretty imminent.

**[00:16:37 - 00:16:43]** You find a map that points to the reactor, as well as schematics of where you have already been.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:55]** And if you're on the landing page on Roll20, then that is what you are seeing would be on the computer screen, highlighting where to go to get the reactor because there's an emergency.

**[00:16:55 - 00:17:01]** There's also a notification in a text box that's not shown saying, P.S., the reactor is about to run.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** It's a virus.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** Don't open it.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** It's a Windows machine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:10]** I thought that it was a Linux machine.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** That's why it needs to update.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:14]** That's why we're f***ing blowing up.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:17]** Stupid grades for all your advanced technology you put it on Windows.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** F***ing job.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** Gates.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:22]** That's why my webcam wasn't working.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:23]** That's why.

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:28]** You discover that there are some control modules.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:40]** The first one allowed you to control the environmental controls of where you are now, possibly making it better for Dr. Osharu, for Dr. OK, as we found out in terms of, you know, steam.

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:44]** You also discover that there are two that you were able to successfully access.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:53]** One that gives you access to the large door that leads to some sort of space that then exits somewhere else.

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:54]** That's to the north of you.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:56]** There were two entrances there.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:59]** One near that creature that you fled from.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:03]** And then one right in the room that you're in right now.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:08]** And you also discover a control module for some access door below you.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:10]** Not sure what it is.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:11]** It's not on the map.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:19]** But you do recall maybe something about a tunnel that's different than the shaft.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:20]** We'll see.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:26]** Then you point out that it was Hears and Dr. O.K.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:31]** that overruled Rick19 to open that thing.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:34]** Because we have no idea where that door is and what it opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:34]** We voted.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** They're like, yeah, let's try it.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** Why not?

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** Why not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:39]** I feel like the upside's too good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:43]** I feel like... The upside is too good.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** Speaking of, we should just go right back to that.

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:48]** I feel like John wouldn't have mentioned it if he didn't want me to go in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:52]** You know, I have to say this about Paizo.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:57]** I'm going to tell you right now, Paizo does a really good job of fleshing out and adding a lot of details.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:04]** And I like that because they all matter, but not all of them matter.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** Does that make sense?

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:06]** They all matter, but they don't all matter.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:08]** And that's not to say that you shouldn't do that.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:12]** I'm just telling you as a whole, I think Paizo more than other things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:13]** Thank you for confusing me further.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** You're welcome.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:18]** Do you mean like each of those experiences is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:44]** is awesome but whether or not you do them doesn't like completely change how it's going to go generally the story or something like that but it's just cool they all have impact like there's all the reason why they're there but sometimes they matter and sometimes they matter but they don't matter but paizo more than i think a lot of other systems that i've played so far tend to do that because otherwise it tends to be pretty like clear-cut like there's this and this and this but paizo likes to build a world and i love it that's why you should play i like it too yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:47]** That being said, we need to go right back to the room with the pinging radiation.

**[00:19:48 - 00:19:49]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:51]** Kevin is very curious.

**[00:19:51 - 00:19:53]** Rick19 wants nothing to do with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:57]** You just don't open a random chat, but please, please go into the room with radiation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:04]** Kev has been texting me in various ways trying to be like, hey, so what's in that room?

**[00:20:04 - 00:20:07]** Hey, so is there a reason we should go back to the room?

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** I need a reason.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:11]** Your reason could just be that your character wants to know.

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Or Dr. O.K.

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** wants to investigate what was going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:15]** That's the problem, though.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** Rick19 wants nothing to do with anything going on in this room.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:18]** Or in this building.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** He wants out.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:19]** Maybe Dr. O.K.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:20]** wants to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:20]** I don't know.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:23]** Maybe Kev can convince Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:26]** Maybe Kev can convince Dr. O.K.

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:27]** Let me just cover one last thing.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:36]** Because as you guys are like, hey, maybe we should just skedaddle on over to that door that probably leads down.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:38]** You discover a little hollow emitter.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:41]** You boot it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:43]** Hello.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** Smiley face.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:51]** And you see an image that seems to be flickering because the emitter's not working great.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:52]** So it didn't say hello, it just says hell.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:59]** And then the image that it flashes is...

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:11]** The one that you've seen before, Professor Benjamin, or Benny, as Kev likes to say, and a Rhyphorian that bears a resemblance to Algeata, as well as a face in the ground.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:15]** They seem to be at a dig site, an archaeological dig site.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:28]** Now, you also find, maybe you hit a button, you see that there's another image there, and you realize that there is another image on it.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:40]** Of a crowd of people of all different races looking adoringly up at a figure who seems to be, you know, kind of dressed up.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:45]** People seem to be reaching out for that figure.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** And it's Sheeran.

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:53]** And their face looks exactly like Keir's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** Why are you giggling, Kelly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:55 - 00:22:04]** Because I love that, A, he's in a business suit, and B, everyone else is looking up at him like he's sharing Jesus or something.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:05]** It's so nice to me.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:06]** Everyone adores him.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:07]** That's great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:08 - 00:22:28]** so i just wait can we see this picture i don't i wish yeah john did you draw it up i don't i don't have this picture this is where my question is is this a john insert or is this is this a an ap you know hey put one of your characters i'm sure you're gonna find the answer to that question i'm sure i'm gonna read it out of jeremy one way or another


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:30]** Jeremy, don't give it up.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:30]** Don't do it, Jeremy.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:32]** Good friend of the pod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:35]** You guys put it in the spoiler bars on Discord, and I won't look at it.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** I promise.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** Yeah, right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** Yeah, definitely.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:45]** So I brought you guys over to Roll20, and this is where we will find ourselves.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:49]** I believe it was Dr. K who was looking at this emitter.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:50]** Maybe, Rick, you came over, too.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:55]** And here's you're standing across the room near the door that you're potentially going to go into.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:58]** So what do you guys do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:03]** Uh, here's, um, I think, uh,

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** Do you recognize this?

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:08]** Is this something that happened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:13]** Is this something that... Here's recognizes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:15]** You don't have any memory of this.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:18]** Oh.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:26]** Can I do some kind of culture or perception check to recognize anything about this scene that we might know...

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:30]** who are the people or what town are they in or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** Can we investigate anything about this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:40]** Yeah, it seems like the first image was a... It must have been some sort of picture that was uploaded to this.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:48]** You can tell a little bit in the surroundings, but there's enough people that it seems like it's shooting more of the foreground than the background.

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:53]** You can maybe make something out, but you can do a culture check and also you can do a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:56]** I'll start with perception.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:56]** Yeah, same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:58]** All right, same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** Here's so confused.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:03]** 19 plus 6 for a 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** 25 from Rick.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:04]** 19.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:05]** What about Dr.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** O.K.?

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** 29.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:09]** Gosh, you guys are killing it.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:09]** 11.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:11]** Here's doesn't see it.

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:12]** I know, right?

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:15]** Maybe you're just so astonished, here's.

**[00:24:15 - 00:24:16]** Maybe you're like, what the?

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:20]** Here's like, uh, uh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:22]** He's just fixated on his own face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:29]** Does anyone, do y'all, it looks like me, but I don't, I don't remember this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** It does look remarkably close.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** I'm not a business guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:37]** Like an archaeological dig or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:42]** Maybe this is some sort of fabrication meant to turn us against each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** I don't know.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:43]** I think so.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** I think so, too, Doctor.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:48]** Don't get the wrong idea from this.

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:49]** All right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:52]** I just want to do a sense motive on here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** Yeah, do we get anything out of that?

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:57]** John, Will, I'm giving you guys space to roleplay, dawg.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** Thanks.

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:59]** That's it.

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:00]** Pow.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** Love it.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:01]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:02 - 00:25:04]** That's USC's strategy right there.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** That's it.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** Just giving you space to do all the work for me.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** I manage you so well, you don't even know.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Yeah, you don't even know.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** I manage you so well.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:17]** He's just like, dad's puppets dance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:25]** So the first image, again, Professor Benny and Raifourian at some sort of dig attracts a second image.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:29]** Can't quite tell from a surrounding sense.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:33]** We started with perception.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:37]** It does seem like you are in some sort of urban area.

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:45]** There seems to be enough in the background between the flickering and the fact that some of the diodes maybe are not working right and the colors might be a little off.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:48]** It seems like you are in some sort of urban area.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:54]** You can give me a culture check in a minute to see maybe just a bit more about what's going on, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** I got a 27 on a culture check.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:56]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:58]** So you did a culture check right now.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** I will roll to...

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** Six plus two.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:01]** I didn't.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:01]** I failed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:05]** Here's the 20 on culture.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:07]** So he succeeds or assists.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:09]** So 29 altogether.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:09]** 29 altogether.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** Great.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:12]** I'll give you the whole picture.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:26]** So you see that you think for a second, maybe you're like, this is probably...

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:29]** Probably Absalom Station.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:32]** There's like enough variety of people.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Things seem to be pretty close together.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** That's your first thought.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:38]** You're like, probably Absalom.

**[00:26:38 - 00:26:47]** But then you notice something right near Hears.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:50]** Or the Hears lookalike, right?

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:55]** And it seems like one of the arms that's coming up, there seems to be an Oma statue.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:17]** on the sleeve of the arm oh and now almost we saw earlier and i could do a starfinder story time but i want to tell you guys more about this before we do that is it you said it's on the sleeve of his suit or it's not his arm like a tattoo not that not the business suit here's just someone's arm

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:23]** That is like out, you know, like when you see in a crowd, like you don't always see a person's face.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:27]** You see the shoulder, their leg, their side, their torso, the side of their face.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:27]** Right.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:31]** You do see what appears to be a clothing that has an Oma on it.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** But here's the interesting thing.

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:42]** Seems like the Oma is eating something like maybe like an ice cream cone or something.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:48]** And you kind of think about it and you're like, I know that Omas are... Love ice cream.

**[00:27:48 - 00:27:52]** Not sure where they are because they're colossal beasts, right?

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:54]** There's no set...

**[00:27:55 - 00:28:01]** Xenobiologists are not sure of their origin exactly from the exact planet, but they are also known as space whales.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:05]** And they are very common on Leovara.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:18]** And you think about it and you're like, maybe the scene is on Leovara because sometimes that's a common symbol is to put whatever your business or club or whatever plus an oma, right?

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** It's a thought.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:22]** Just like Dakine in like Hawaii.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:23]** Yeah.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Yeah.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:27]** It's like indicative of that place or someone has it and they're somewhere else.

**[00:28:28 - 00:28:29]** Not quite sure.

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** Definitely some sort of urban center.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:33]** Absalom also could be Leovara.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:33]** I don't know.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:35]** But here's the other thing that you notice.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** You're looking again.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** The lights are flickering.

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** The ground is shaking.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:44]** The power in this place is unstable.

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:46]** So as the lights are flickering.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:46]** Oh, wait.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:48]** Did you stabilize the lights?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:28:48 - 00:28:49]** You did.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** I think you did.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** We did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** I think we did.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** Yeah.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:51]** Okay.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** So you stabilize the lights.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:54]** So for the most part, they're stable.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** Every once in a while, they flicker.

**[00:28:55 - 00:29:00]** But even so, with the brightness and everything else, you're like, no effing way.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:07]** It seems like as you turn it one way, and I'm looking at roll 20 here, maybe it's like Dr. Okay.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:13]** The way that you're looking at it, Dr. Okay, you're like, there's nothing.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:17]** That looks like the face of a gray standing in the crowd.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:21]** And Rick and Kears are looking from another angle.

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:24]** And they're like, I don't see it.

**[00:29:24 - 00:29:30]** The perspective seems to be shifted where it seems like Dr. O'Keefe sees it from just the way that you're looking at it.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:34]** And the gray is not staring at Kears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:34 - 00:30:00]** the business suit here they're staring at the perspective of the viewer creepy who has seen the scene it's like one of those like things that you that you had as a kid where you would like turn it and then you know what i mean like there's like two images inside one image the special cups that had or the yeah yeah they still do those things i think they still do those things i think so but that is terrifying


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:03]** Wait, question about that though is like, so if Dr. O.K.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:07]** sees it and then he hands it to somebody else and hasn't turned it, would they see the gray then as they rotate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:09]** Yeah, but just... Okay.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:10]** Again, Dr.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:12]** O.K., you crushed it on that roll.

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:16]** So it's like, just because you saw that, you were in that right position.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:21]** Otherwise, you might not have noticed it if you hadn't viewed it from that side, but there was just something about it.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:21]** Oh, this is...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:24]** There's a gray in this crowd.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:25]** I can't see it.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** Here's like kind of goes over to Dr. K's perspective.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:36]** I think this adds to your theory that this might be some kind of projection or simulation image.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** This may not be real.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:46]** This is meant to possibly, I don't know, garner some sort of response from us, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:46 - 00:31:11]** um can i can i do i don't know medicine or is it another perspective um perception to uh see how close here's is to the image like is it possible to verify that they are the same or is there something that sticks out looks like years i don't think you need to do any sort of check i mean it looks like years i'm gonna take 20 i'm just kidding here's this one yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:20]** uh do a uh computer can you do like an engineering check on this or something or computers check see like how that's happening


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:23]** There doesn't seem to be any markings on it.

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:25]** There's no connection port.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:29]** It just seems like it was busted and it's semi-working.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** Typically, maybe these could hold more.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:37]** These are the only two that are really coming out or that seem like they are on it.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:40]** It seems like otherwise it's pretty blank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:45]** But you can tell that the photo was modified or wasn't modified with a certain check?

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:45]** I don't know.

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:47]** Okay, got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:31:47 - 00:32:11]** you don't know yeah i see i don't like grace uh so what do you guys want to do we should probably keep this in mind keep it and uh get on yeah i think uh it's better we get out of this place than dwell on the uh motives behind such a

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:26]** Well, what appears to be a fabrication if, you know, I don't believe anything from these graves, but I tend to, I've come to believe you here to be truthful.

**[00:32:26 - 00:32:26]** Yes.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:35]** I'm not, I don't see this and I don't think that you're involved here.

**[00:32:36 - 00:32:38]** Just something doesn't seem right about you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:42]** I have the same sentiments, but I do think we should hold on to this holodesk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:46]** I appreciate your sentiments, and I agree we should.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:47]** Alright.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** Just stick it inside of the briefcase.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:50]** Just open up the briefcase.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:56]** A little cup holder comes out.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:58]** It's kind of low, ironically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:32:58 - 00:33:23]** or whatever you want it to be you could you could change that well yeah i could program it i suppose sure but i need the actual uh i need the weapon right to clone you do does it clone or does it destroy uh clones it clones you all do this already so i could clone it as a costa jet right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:48]** there are some limitations an hour or whatever yeah it takes an hour and i think there's some some limitations on what it can clone yes i forget it was like small because i tried to to say like put all my heavy weapons in there so yeah no it's only small arms and uh i think like a melee weapon here's is gonna go to the door oh my last question was sorry was that were there any other modules that we didn't hack into i know they said there were two and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:48 - 00:33:59]** No, there weren't and I've last episode dr. K. You had asked to like was this Station different from any other stations and they all access the same point same terminal.

**[00:33:59 - 00:34:00]** Yep.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:00]** Yep.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:03]** They all access the same Server shell.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:04]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:05]** All right.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:16]** Well, you know more about that Yeah, I think is gonna what I love his axe and walk over and kill finder not real Okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:20]** So, Rick, you pull out your axe and you attack yours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** He's like, I'm suspicious after all.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:24]** Hey, Rick.

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:29]** Let's not murder everybody.

**[00:34:29 - 00:34:31]** Let's not murder everything, Mr. Bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:37]** It is what I am programmed for.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:37]** Crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:45]** No, he pulls out his axe and he's going to put his hand on the door and look back at you two and say, are we ready to proceed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:45 - 00:34:46]** I think so.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** You go first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:50]** That was my intention.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:51]** That's good.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:52]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:34:52 - 00:34:53]** That's why we're at Greece.

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** We're on the same page here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:58]** All right.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** Anything else?

**[00:35:01 - 00:35:02]** I'm ready to move down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:03]** Let's do it.

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:04]** You guys ready to go down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:06]** All right.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:11]** Actually, we also saw a dog eat an avocado today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:13]** Damn it, Huel.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:14]** Huel.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:16]** The right words for every occasion.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:18]** May the Huel be with you.

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:20]** May the Huel be with you.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:23]** It's too good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** And also with you.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:30]** Well, Rick is gone, so here's just going to follow him, I guess.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:34]** Rick just went into the darkness on roll 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:34 - 00:35:35]** I'm in the ladder well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:36]** Well, there we go.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** Come on, Riggies.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** All right, I will move you guys appropriately in here.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:41]** You guys are funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:42]** Down ladder.

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** Down ladder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:45]** Down ladder.

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:48]** All right, stop moving, and I'll put you guys where you want to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:55]** If you're going down a ladder, you shout down a ladder to let people below you know that you're coming down so they don't climb up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:58]** Just hope that they're not in blue camos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:00]** Then you can't see them.

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:01]** Makes it very difficult.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:03]** That's why it all makes sense.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** That's why.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:09]** I will reveal that you guys walk into the door.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:11]** It's a lighter door.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:13]** It didn't seem to be locked.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:15]** You walk in.

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:22]** And you see that you're in a small octagonal chamber.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:25]** There's an open rock shaft.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:30]** With a narrow metal ladder attached to the eastern side.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:37]** And there's dark green fluid spattered on the floor around the entrance.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:41]** And I will reveal it right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:43]** Oh, it's much bigger than I thought.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:45]** I thought it was going to be like a five by five.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:48]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:51]** You should probably continue down ladder, no?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:58]** It's about 15 feet across and 15 feet high, and it's octagonal.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:01]** Can you do a life science check or something on this fluid?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:30]** sure you put it up here you had a question whoops i was gonna say here's just gonna cast cast perception he was going to perceive at the bottom of the letter cast cast perception if you can't see anything he's going to yeah exactly if you can't see anything uh zero level spell zero level spell i'm going he's gonna like throw down some lights you know but uh rolled a 29 for life's high assist okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:53]** so you're assisting you put it in and you realize this green fluid that's all around it seems like it is troll blood and it seems radioactive uh hey radioactive troll uh blood is what i think this is okay and uh

**[00:37:53 - 00:38:04]** That doesn't seem like something that I want to investigate further, frankly, but I think we should just be careful and continue because, well, we should.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:08]** We'll probably have to fight some troll in order to get the reactor shut off.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:14]** I have a funny feeling that that's what John has planned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:15 - 00:38:23]** From my understanding and my immense nuclear background, that is the only way to shut down a nuclear reactor is by killing its troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:28]** I think that the murder bot learned that in the Navy.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:29]** This is what you had to do in the Navy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** You just had to kill a troll every time you had to do something.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:32]** It's a secret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:41]** It's a secret occult ritual on all of your submarines where you have to summon a troll to start it.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** You have to kill it to keep it going.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:48]** Dude, like, it's... Man, conspiracies are crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** John is losing his mind right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:49]** I'm so

**[00:38:49 - 00:39:14]** Oh my god, that was so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:18]** Join the navy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:44]** you need to be strong there is there is actually a really good uh like it's a simplified drawing of a submarine and it it's like describing what everything is and part of it is like magic and the wizards are back here and yes i'll try to find it for you okay okay peaking down the ladder well but he only rolled an 11 so does he see or sense anything down there


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:50]** You can see that it's probably, you estimate, 50 to 60 feet down.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** It's pretty far.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:57]** It's dark along the way, and then at the very bottom, it does seem like...

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:05]** that whatever is down there, the opening is a bit higher up than just the floor.

**[00:40:05 - 00:40:08]** It's not like it just drops right down and then you're in a tunnel.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:10]** It seems like it opens up at the bottom.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:26]** And at the bottom, as compared to up here where the lights are mostly stable now with whatever reserve power there is, down there, they do seem to still be flickering bright, but also flickering a lot more than they are up here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:34]** we should crawl down slowly and check when we're near the bottom so we don't run into any surprises.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:34]** Yeah.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:37]** Can I tell you off this micro cord, you think?

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:41]** And perhaps we can safely get back up if we need to.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Oh, that's smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** That is a great idea, Dr. O'Keefe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** That's very good.

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:46]** Boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:46 - 00:40:50]** So you, you take a lash off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:58]** I do, you know, my three point or, uh, five points of, uh, you know, safety for repelling naturally.

**[00:40:59 - 00:40:59]** Uh,

**[00:41:00 - 00:41:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:01]** Okay.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:03]** Question, how does Bernice go down?

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Do you just carry?

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** I carry.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:06]** Okay.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:08]** You do need two hands to carry and go down.

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:15]** But I would assume that you can probably kind of... I don't think that you're going to take a penalty to have Bernice in one hand.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** I mean, I think Bernice can climb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:17]** Okay.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:20]** Just like two little hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:22]** So what order are you guys going down the ladder in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:28]** Well, our resident tank, Sir Rick, might be interested.


## Speaker_0

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:28]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:41:28 - 00:41:33]** Perhaps there's something down there you can murder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:39]** As much as you guys believe that, that is not my only purpose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:43]** I'll be right behind you and I can give you some light if you need.

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:43]** Yes.

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** Yeah, the tunnel's dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:50]** You can cast dancing lights now, right?

**[00:41:50 - 00:41:51]** And move them with us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:52]** That's fair.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:53]** I'll do that.

**[00:41:54 - 00:41:56]** Oh, wow.

**[00:41:57 - 00:41:58]** Nice UI upgrade.

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** Roll 20.

**[00:41:59 - 00:41:59]** All right.

**[00:41:59 - 00:42:01]** So no hero lab.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:01]** All right.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:02]** So here's cast dancing lights.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** Okay.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** So you cast dancing lights.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** There's no cast anymore.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** I'll just put that way.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:09]** Dancing lights.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:16]** And so four dancing lights come out and he'll make them, I don't know, green or something for the hell of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:16 - 00:42:19]** Okay, so the green lights illuminate.

**[00:42:20 - 00:42:24]** And as you are looking down, you start to climb down.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:28]** Rick goes first, then here's the Dr. K, then Bernice.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:34]** The rock wall does seem like it is some sort of, well, for lack of a better term, rock.

**[00:42:35 - 00:42:40]** It seems like this shaft just goes right through rock in order to get down to the bottom.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** And then this ladder that you're on.

**[00:42:41 - 00:42:48]** I'm going to move you guys to the page that I very creatively called Ladder.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:54]** And now you guys start to walk down the ladder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:55]** Oh, look at that.

**[00:42:55 - 00:42:57]** Wait, let's pause and tell our readers.

**[00:42:58 - 00:43:00]** There's a circle on top.

**[00:43:00 - 00:43:01]** There's a circle on bottom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:05]** Okay, it looks like someone copied and pasted a ladder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:06 - 00:43:08]** I'm pretty sure you found ladder in Roll20.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:10]** Oh, I definitely found ladder in Roll20.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:11]** I'm sorry, John.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:11]** You just made it really big.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:12 - 00:43:13]** I thought it was like a fish-shaped thing.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:15]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** It's fun.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:21]** But you could have also just drawn that with like... Did it need to be drawn?

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:24]** I'm not sure what his... No, I'm sure something's going to happen.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:25]** It's like two portals.

**[00:43:25 - 00:43:26]** I'm sure we're all going to die.

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** We're all going to die.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:28]** And then a ladder in the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** We'll find out next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:30 - 00:43:31]** That's our app.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:33]** No, you'll find out this time.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:37]** Because you start going down and maybe about 20 feet.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:39]** And I'm going to put you guys...

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:39]** Yeah.

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:41]** Put you here.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:42]** Here's your here.

**[00:43:42 - 00:43:43]** I can actually put you on the ladder.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:46]** I had you off the ladder because I thought it was a nice scale on the side.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:47]** But you're on the ladder.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:50]** Maybe about 20 feet down.

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:58]** And as you're getting closer, you realize that it's 55 feet from the top that you're at down to the bottom of the ladder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:02]** And each one of these rungs is 10 feet apart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** Roughly.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:03]** Sure.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** Let's say.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:06]** For the sake of order, let's say this.

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** Because...

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:24]** As you're going down, you see on your left, you see a, what appears to be a three foot wide and five foot tall tunnel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:27]** That's the door you guys open.

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:29]** There's no door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:36]** I'm going to show you what you, just for reference purposes here, you see, right?

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:46]** You see that there does appear to be something that was carved into the rock that allows this to be a, again, three foot wide, five foot tall.

**[00:44:46 - 00:45:09]** tunnel that you could go into if you wanted and it's mostly dark but as you get right rick about to the level or right below it so here's can see there's a little bit of track lighting that's purple that goes about five feet in that illuminates that there is more tunnel uh further down and you can't it's pitch black past that so as you walk through it it will light up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:18]** Are we, based on, you know, the conspicuousness of this tunnel, do we believe that it was the one that we just opened?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:20]** Likely so.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:37]** You also recall Shay talking about a tunnel and saying something about, you know, if you encounter it, like, not to worry about it, but that's, but like on the way down, you'll probably find it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** What do you mean not to worry about it?

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** Like, as in, don't worry.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** What's in the tunnel?

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:44]** It's not bad, or just don't do it.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** Don't, like, even concern yourself with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:49]** Yeah, like, don't concern yourself with it.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:51]** Oh, well, we may not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:53]** I'm concerned.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:56]** This is halfway down the ladder, you're saying?

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** Or something like that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** This is like the mezzanine.

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:20]** tunnel yeah it's about 20 feet down this the ladder still goes down probably another 35 feet it seems like down 35 feet is where you need to go to get to the reactor we're gonna look at this we're not gonna open this and not explore come on obviously okay all right here's this gonna send two of his lights into the access whatever okay let's see if he can see anything

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:26]** The lights seem to go down maybe 20 to 30 feet.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:32]** And then from there, it seems to make a hard right.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** Okay.

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:40]** So from where you are, it seems like it, it, it will go down and then seems to go to the right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:46]** Bernice is going, I'm going to say to Bernice to check out the tunnel.

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** Okay.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:48]** Good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:48]** Okay.

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:52]** Here's, we'll just make sure those two lights like flank Bernice to help her see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** Okay.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:59]** I'll be like down the tunnel, but like maybe 10 feet, 20 feet behind.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:02]** Oh, so you want to go into the tunnel.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:02]** That's okay.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:03]** Well, with Bernice?

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:08]** Yeah, I don't want to leave Bernice alone, so to speak.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:10]** I want to be in, at least within your shot.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:10]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** Does anybody else go in the tunnel?

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:13]** Or Rick, or here's you hanging on to the ladder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:18]** I will stay here and provide, observate, what's the word?

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** I'm sorry.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:19]** Stand sit.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:20]** Trevor watch?

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:21]** Yeah, that's the word.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:21 - 00:47:22]** Okay.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:22]** What is here, Steve?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:23]** Sorry.

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:25]** Brain went blank.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** Here's is going to crawl in.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:27]** Bye, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:55]** so bernice goes first right because again you guys are gonna have to squeeze this is three feet wide five feet tall yeah it's about the size of me it's fine and and bernice is much smaller that's true but just saying it's not it's not big you can't like get past each other i don't know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** I feel like Bernice could get by.

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:01]** Bernice could because Bernice is literally tiny, but you are a normal-sized creature.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:05]** I couldn't crawl over here, but Bernice could crawl over both of us.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** So it's Bernice, then Dr. K, then here's.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** Right?

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** Okay.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:12]** So you walk in and here's.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** Do I need to equip some things?

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:17]** You can equip things if you want.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:18]** Okay.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:18]** Okay.

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:23]** Right as you step in here, there's another rumble.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:28]** Doesn't seem like it's associated with the tunnel, but it's a troll.

**[00:48:28 - 00:48:39]** Rick, you're going to need to give me a dex save because it seems like it's shaking enough that you on the ladder need to hold on because it throws you.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:42]** He's lashed to the microchord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:42 - 00:48:43]** Thank God.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** Here it's not there.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:46]** Not being very dexterous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** Are you guys lashed to the microchord, all of you?

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:53]** Or is the microchord there in case you need to climb up and the ladder's not there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:48:54 - 00:49:00]** I... I mean, I rappel with a chord all the time if I'm rappelling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:02]** So Dr. K's on the chord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:06]** Yeah, but can two of you be on the same chord from a single chord?

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** I'd say that Rick wasn't on the chord.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** So Rick's not on the chord.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:14]** I'm trying to retcon it just for you.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:18]** Yeah, I thought that you guys were just hanging it to be able to climb up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:21]** No, that was his point is to tie us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:23]** Well, Rick's not on it.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:26]** Rick, you need to make a deck save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:29]** 18 total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:35]** You definitely are fine to just stay on it.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** You hang on.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:39]** Maybe one hand kind of presses against the shaft, but you're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:42]** I'm just going to jam my axe into the wall and use it as a support.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:44]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** Finger jam.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:45]** Finger jam.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:48]** That's awesome.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:55]** I did realize that you should have rolled to climb because climbing does require an athletics check.

**[00:49:56 - 00:50:00]** We'll do that again because I think going down with the cord, especially Dr. O'Keefe, you're probably fine.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:02]** Let me move you guys over to what you see in the tunnel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:04]** Oh, it says you need at least two hands to climb.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:05]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:08]** So I'll put my axe away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** So, Rick, you're not in the tunnel, but you will see this.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:12]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:13]** hears in Bernice.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:19]** There seems to be slight purple track lighting that's just illuminating the small tunnel.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:24]** And again, it extends maybe 30 feet down.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** What do you do?

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:28]** Hmm.

**[00:50:28 - 00:50:29]** I think he is.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:34]** What do you do in words and not on roll 20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:37]** We're slowly inching towards the corner.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:38]** Okay.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:46]** And Bernice is sort of like just sort of scanning and trying to be as alert and as stealthy as possible.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** So I'm a shh.

**[00:50:48 - 00:51:06]** She's trying to blend in to this purple track lighting, so maybe she turns her outward LEDs to match the same hue and same sync rate, and it's just sort of inching forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:14]** I really hate that I zoomed out on this map and saw that this tunnel is this tiny little piece of this big black map.

**[00:51:15 - 00:51:18]** I hope John does that just to mess with us, but


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:40]** bernice turns the corner it seems like there's more tunnel except it extends maybe what is that 25 feet down then there seems to be a door that would probably normally be closed but it's open it's open and i'm going to reveal it here

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:43]** I will reveal up to the door because you all haven't.

**[00:51:43 - 00:51:46]** Again, the track lighting starts to extend a little ways up.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:47]** No, that's fine.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:51]** And you can't quite see what's past it.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:51]** It's more tunnel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:54]** Okay, inch up there.

**[00:51:54 - 00:51:55]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** You inch up there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:57 - 00:52:06]** Bernice is going to slowly crawl on a bed of nanites along the floor.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:08]** Silently.

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:11]** Up to where?

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** Up to the door.

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:13]** The opening.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:17]** Have Bernice give me a perception check.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:22]** Bernice's perception is lower than my own.

**[00:52:23 - 00:52:26]** However... Yours is insane, so I think a lot of people's are lower than yours.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:27]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** Oh.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:30]** Oh.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** 19.

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:32]** 19.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:34]** Okay.

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:37]** Seems like the tunnel just extends.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:40]** I'll reveal a little more.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:44]** Seems like the tunnel extends past the door.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** Past the door.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:45]** The door's open.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:53]** I'm not going to show more, but it seems like it goes a little further and probably extends past what you can see there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** Wait, that door is open?

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** Is that the door we opened remotely?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:57]** You would think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** Yeah, so I'm going to, Dr. O.K.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:14]** is going to kind of crawl up to Bernice, or, you know, slime up to crawl, whatever, to Bernice and investigate the door and see if there's any, like, sensors or anything like that.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:15]** Okay.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:23]** You know, booby traps or, like, some sort of, is there a way to, like, detect if there's been an intrusion?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:27]** Sure, give me a, you give me a perception check, Dr.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:27]** O.K.


## Speaker_0

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:27]** ?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:59]** natural 20 for gross freaking what is it it's gonna be nuts 32 perception 32 just good enough just just good enough to be able to see that you're like what is what is that on the other side of the door it seems like way down at the other end of the hallway there's probably another corner you think has to be


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:13]** Because you see that there appears to be a motion sensor beam that is detecting that side of the door and seems to be detecting the rest of the hallway there.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:14]** Nice.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:15]** Wow.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** You just got it.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** It was DC-29.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** What the ****?

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** You just got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:20]** That's crazy.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:22]** Whew.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:22]** Good job.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:24]** That was fortunate.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:24]** Yes.

**[00:54:24 - 00:54:25]** Very fortunate.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:28]** Uh, I'm going to relay this to here.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:35]** So I'm going to say, uh, here's, there's seems to be some sort of, uh, motion sensor here.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:40]** Uh, I wonder if this is to guard some sort of treasure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** Oh, thanks for letting me know.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** I might be able to shut it down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:44]** Yes.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:45]** I could use your assistance.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:48]** Maybe on a computers to disable this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:52]** You would need to go into the tunnel to the other side to disable it.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:54]** It is detecting this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:56]** It is detecting this way.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:59]** Can I perceive whether or not Bernice can slip by this detection net?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:06]** I don't think you could because it seems like it's just detecting anybody and it's a small thing coming through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:30]** do we spring the trap or do we i'm i didn't quite like this is this is as it's shown here sensing the other side of this right and we can't there's some sort of like beam being emitted from the other end of the hallway onto some sort of receptor on this side


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:32]** But it doesn't on this side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:37]** He's saying the controls are on the other side.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:40]** They're protected on the other side of the sensor.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:44]** It's catching who's coming down this tunnel towards...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:47]** So there's no way to shut it down, basically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:48]** Yeah, it seems like it's at the other end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:52]** Can we see the receptor on this end?

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:55]** Do we have access to it from behind or from the side?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:55 - 00:55:59]** If you want to send dancing lights through, maybe you could see it from that end.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** Sure, here's where we'll do that.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:05]** Yeah, you can see that it's at the other end of the hall, probably about 30 feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:12]** So there's like some sort of reflector here that sends the beam back to the receptor on the other end.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:15]** Now you're getting into how this works.

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:18]** And I will just say that I don't think that it is quite like that.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:21]** You would just need to extend it.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:22]** Let me ask this.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:22]** Yeah.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:23]** How about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:23 - 00:56:29]** Is there a way for me to engineer a way past this without tripping it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** I don't think so.

**[00:56:30 - 00:56:31]** Not from where you are now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:37]** Can I take the sensor and convert it into something else to set it up for my own... Yes, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:39]** Can Bernice, like, eat it?

**[00:56:39 - 00:56:40]** Yeah, or something like that.

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:43]** Well, we got to... Yeah.

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:47]** Do we go for it, or do we just turn around?

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:50]** Looks like we can't go... Oh, wow, we...

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:50]** Oh, yeah, that's right.

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:53]** I guess we do have the option to just set it off.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:54]** That is an option.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:56]** Yeah, it is an option.

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:00]** Not one I cherish or relish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:05]** I don't think it's a good idea.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** We could...

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:09]** I don't know, we could just keep it in mind.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:12]** Maybe there's another way forward somewhere at a later point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:12 - 00:57:16]** Yeah, maybe we can figure out a way to turn this off and come back.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:19]** Can Rick hear all this conversation?

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:20]** He's close enough, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:22]** Yeah.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:27]** Wait, we could ask the... Well, they wouldn't necessarily know what...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:30]** You could ask the stewards if you would like.

**[00:57:31 - 00:57:32]** It's not a problem.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:32]** Oh, we do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:34]** We have a comms with them, too.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** Hey, we went down that tunnel we weren't supposed to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:38]** You want to ask them?

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** Say we were to go down it.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** You want to ask them?

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:44]** It does seem like the comms are a little staticky.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:46]** Just because they're in a tunnel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:52]** Even for you, Rick, it seems like they're just a little static.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:53]** Anyway, so what do you guys want to do?

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:55]** Wait, so we can't hear them?

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:56]** We can't communicate with them?

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** No, you can.

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:57]** It's fine.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:00]** It's just like the voice is like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:02]** I do not think we should trip the device.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** I think we should move forward.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:04]** It might be our way out, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** Do you want to ask the stewards?

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:07]** Here, just quickly ask them.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:09]** What's on the other end of the shaft?

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:10]** Because we went inside it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:20]** The shaft, well, it doesn't have any troll slime, so I'm more inclined to go down this than some other shaft.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:23]** Can I do perception for troll slime in the ladder well?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:26]** Yeah, there's no troll slime in the ladder well.

**[00:58:27 - 00:58:28]** Oh, never mind.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:29]** There was at the top.

**[00:58:30 - 00:58:31]** There was at the top.

**[00:58:31 - 00:58:32]** It's not near there.

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:38]** It seems like, like I said, it seems like the shaft is intended to go down.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** This is just another tunnel.

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:42]** But you ping the stewards.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:45]** And who said who?

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:46]** It was Dr. K, you asked?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:47]** Yes.

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** Okay.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:52]** Hey, we found a tunnel with a motion detector.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:55]** Okay.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:56]** That's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:01]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:08]** Well, that was... I... I really... I mean... The comms is like, oh, they found it.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:08]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:10]** God, what'd you say, Shay?

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:14]** Don't go down there under any circumstances.

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** They're catching on to us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** They're catching on to us.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:19]** Graze, they say and stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** We knew it.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:20]** In Aklo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:23]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:23]** We graze.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** GG, guys.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:25]** GG.

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:28]** GG.

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:31]** Hey, it's Kevin.

**[00:59:31 - 00:59:34]** I'm just going to hop up on this little soapbox of mine.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:45]** As you probably know, I was a nuke mechanic on a submarine, and back then my job was actually to maintain water chemistry and monitor the reactor plant for radiation and contamination.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:50]** And so I know we joked about nuclear power in this episode and killing the troll and all that, but on a serious note...

**[00:59:50 - 01:00:12]** climate change being a huge problem in our world nuclear power is the safest and most efficient form of electrical generation even more so than solar energy is and like i don't want to start bashing on solar energy and renewables i think they're great too but like nuclear power has to be a part of that solution if we're going to actually get out of this climate crisis that we have

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:16]** In addition to all that, I know the next question is always, what about nuclear waste?

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:23]** Nuclear waste is actually very, very small in comparison to the amount of waste produced by other energies, including solar.

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:31]** And on top of that, the amount of nuclear waste ever produced in the United States fits in one football field stack three stories tall.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:37]** I know that sounds like a lot, but it's actually tiny for the amount of energy that nuclear power has been creating for the last...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:37 - 01:01:00]** 70 years the question after that is always like you know the question after that is always very interesting and i think it would be awesome to release kev's full unedited outro but until then i think you should just message him if you're curious he is a font of information about nuclear power and for the sake of this outro i think kev wants to succinctly say thank you so much

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:03]** for always being such wonderful supporters and listeners.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:18]** We really appreciate you, and it would be mighty kind of you to throw us a few stars on Spotify or Apple or wherever you review, or maybe even just send us some glow-in-the-dark stars that mount onto your ceiling.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:20]** That would be phenomenal.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:23]** See you next We'll Save Wednesday.
