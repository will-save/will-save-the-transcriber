## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:07]** Last time on We'll Saveâ€¦ Confusion magnified the mental state of our group.

**[00:00:07 - 00:00:11]** Some were tired and bewildered, while others were pushed to the brink.

**[00:00:12 - 00:00:19]** The stress was too much for Nico Orion as he broke down, feeling the futility and uncertainty of their situation.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:27]** Seeking solace in the truth, the group investigated their new surroundings, seeking answers.

**[00:00:27 - 00:00:32]** When Rick-19 discovered alien markings on the wall, he attempted to inscribe them on the floor.

**[00:00:33 - 00:00:41]** However, that didn't sit well with whoever's holding the strings in this room, and two robots descended from the ceiling to ambush our companions.

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:43]** What is this new threat?

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:45]** Can they handle it?

**[00:00:46 - 00:00:49]** Find out this time on We'll Save.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:12]** That was so good.

**[00:02:14 - 00:02:16]** So I'm just going to start real quick.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:17]** I just want to go around.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:18]** Let's just see.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:24]** We got four incredible guests here who are only here for this one episode and never going to be on the show again.

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** We'll make the best of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:27]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** So this is the penultimate episode.

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:31]** Make it your best.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:31]** Let's see what happens.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:32]** Okay.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:34]** Kevin's giving me a look.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:34]** I'm confused.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** You're saying I'm a guest?

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Dangerous look.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:37]** He's offended.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** I've been here the whole time.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:40]** Feisty, this guest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:41]** How are you?

**[00:02:41 - 00:02:42]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:43]** That was delicious.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:45]** Cover your eyes.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:46]** I took a drink.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** I'm doing great.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** I'm doing fantastic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** Yeah?

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:50]** Yeah.

**[00:02:51 - 00:02:55]** Any fun facts about your day or your life?

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:57]** No, nothing too exciting.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:58]** All right.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** I'll ask you a fun fact then.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:00]** That's fine.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:02]** Sorry.

**[00:03:02 - 00:03:03]** I was unprepared for this.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:04]** No, it's cool.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:07]** I mean, you know, it's just a show that goes out to people who listen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:09]** But they don't want to know about my fun facts.

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:10]** That's not true.

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:10]** They do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:13]** If you want to know about Kev's day, tell us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:14]** I worked a little bit.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** Okay.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:15]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** Kev, it's a Wednesday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:18]** We're recording on a Wednesday.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:19]** We are recording on a Wednesday.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:20]** Yeah.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:20]** It's a school night.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** It's a school night.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:28]** Kev, would you rather fight one elephant-sized pigeon or 50 pigeon-sized elephants?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:31]** Yeah.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:34]** The answer to this question is obvious.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:35]** I've thought hard about this one.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:37]** I feel like we've had a debate about this.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:39]** There's nothing to think about.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** Can you last that long?

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** All right, we just kick them.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:45]** One elephant-sized pigeon.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:47]** He said 50 elephant-sized pigeons.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:49]** Or one elephant-sized elephant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:53]** No, one elephant-sized pigeon or 50 pigeon-sized elephants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:58]** It's like a large number of small things or a small number of large things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** Are they organized?

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]** Are they in a pack?

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:03]** Do they have tactics?

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** Is it a Zerg rush?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:11]** I feel like if Nick were controlling them, they would have a lot of tactics, like some sort of total war.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** Do you play a lot of RTS games, Nick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:13]** He does.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** Does he really?

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:17]** Yeah, Nick, there was one that you played that cost you $100, right?

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** What do you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** He's gambling?

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:22]** Are you playing underground RTS?

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:25]** Is this the interview where you talk to us about your RTS addiction?

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:27]** It's a whole other side of you I've never known about.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:28]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:28 - 00:04:29]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** I got a fun story about this.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** So I played Starfinder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:33]** I love Kev's fun stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:35]** Yeah, I played Starfinder to death.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:38]** And I remember very vividly... Starcraft?

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:38]** Starcraft, sorry.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:41]** Yeah, I was like... I play Starfinder all the time.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:45]** We do, but... So when Starcraft came out, I played it all the time, constantly.

**[00:04:45 - 00:04:49]** And I had a dream one time that I woke up, and it was like my house.

**[00:04:50 - 00:04:56]** And when I went out into the living room and then out into the front yard, my yard was like a wasteland of...

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:59]** And I was actually, like, I was, like, placing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:59 - 00:04:59]** Like a spire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:04]** Well, I was, like, placing down the buildings into my yard.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:06]** And, like, the little troops were coming out of them.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** But, like, the buildings were, like, they're, like, miniature.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:08]** They weren't, like, tiny.

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** That sounds like the most awesome dream ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:12]** Like a pigeon-sized elephant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:14]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:14]** No, bigger than that.

**[00:05:14 - 00:05:15]** Way bigger.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:17]** I'd say like a turtle, like a tortoise size.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** Like a Galapagos.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:20]** You know the command center?

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:20]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:26]** It was like the size of a tortoise, and I'd set it down, and then the little bots would come out and be like, how's your command?

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:26]** Or whatever they used to say.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:27]** I forget all their...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:29]** That's a good dream.

**[00:05:29 - 00:05:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:32]** That sounds like the best dream ever.

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** Oh, it was awesome.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** I love those dreams.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:36]** Those dreams are great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:36]** Yeah.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:36]** That's nice.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:41]** So I was trying to rack my brain on what RTS game cost me $100.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:54]** And I think we'd all agree for anybody who's gamed or played an RTS game, but I paid $100 for a discontinued license to play Battle from Middle Earth 2 Lord of the Rings.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** That's it?

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:55]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:55 - 00:06:18]** because ea lost license to make the game you can't even buy the game anymore so it's almost it's as much a collector's item as it is game well that's awesome you should know anyone listening that sometimes you can find servers for games that no longer exist for example um star wars galaxies you can find old servers for that even though it's no longer technically an active game but um

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:22]** But yeah, we can pay $100 like Nick on eBay or something.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** I feel like he just called you.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]** I didn't mean for that, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:32]** I'm just saying like... Look, when it comes to the server stuff, I'm just horrible.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:37]** I am likely to get viruses and I'm going to be like, why can't I play this game?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:39]** Technically proficient, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** I've technically never done it myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:43]** Recently, I really wanted to play like Fallout 1 and 2 again.

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** But they were available for Mac.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** I only have a Mac.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** I don't have anything else.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** You haven't joined the master race.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:50]** No.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:52]** Oh, those are really good though.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:52]** I hear.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:52]** Yeah.

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:55]** Max are fun, but they, they don't.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:58]** Yeah.

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:02]** They're, they're decent, but they don't make, uh, they made it for a little while.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** It was available for max.

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:05]** And then they, they discontinued it.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:07]** Just a game on a Mac sold out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:11]** Yeah, don't unless it is Fallout 1 or 2 because it can handle it then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:12]** I'm sure it can handle it.

**[00:07:12 - 00:07:17]** Shout out to Stadia who allows me to play Cyberpunk 2077 on my Mac.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:19]** Just whatever you do, never split your hard drive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:20]** You just pay for the game.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:23]** Just whatever you do, never split your hard drive on a Mac.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:27]** You can split your hard drive so that like half the hard drive's PC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:27 - 00:07:28]** Oh, don't get me started on this topic.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** Yeah, let's not get started.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:30]** Instead, Nick, how are you?

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:31]** I don't know.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:37]** I was supposed to do it for school because a lot of engineering programs don't work on Macs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:40]** So just run Docker or VMware.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:43]** Yeah, I just did remote access type stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:44]** Nick, how are you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:46]** I'm okay.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:47]** I'm doing a status update.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:49]** Status update.

**[00:07:50 - 00:07:53]** I'm moving in with my girlfriend, and we're very, very happy.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** Hey-o.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:54]** Congratulations.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:56]** Hey-o.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** So, yes.

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:00]** Aside from that, just very, very tired.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:07]** I work 12 hours a day most days, and it's just so damn good to be on the podcast tonight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:09]** Yeah.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:11]** Good to have you here away from home.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:13]** Nick, what's your answer?

**[00:08:14 - 00:08:16]** Oh, boss fight all the way.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:18]** One elephant-sized pigeon.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:18]** I knew it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** Let's go!

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:21]** That's a giant pigeon, man.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:22]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:26]** That's a huge pigeon, dude.

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** Leroy Jenkins!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:28]** I have a question about this.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** We're going to cut that.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:30]** I have a question.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:33]** That is a huge peak on all of our mics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:35]** John's like, oh, shit, turn it down.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** He's doing it.

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:36]** He's showing us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** Literally all of our mics peaked.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:40]** Literally all of them.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:43]** It's just a wall of white in the logic session.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** Let's just not do that.

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** You do a good Leroy, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:48]** Here's a funny story, though.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:52]** I think John might be the only one who knows this story.

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:57]** When I was younger, probably around 10 or 12, I tried out for this thing called American Juniors.

**[00:08:58 - 00:09:01]** This is back when I was still pursuing my music career really heavy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:05]** What is it called?

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:05]** Starstruck?

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:07]** It's kind of like American Idol, but for kids.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:10]** Anyway, this is my first audition.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:15]** It was the first time I sang in front of, what, 50 to 100 people all in the same room?

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:16]** It's more than I ever done.

**[00:09:16 - 00:09:18]** Well, I was wearing khaki pants.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** What?

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** I was wearing khaki pants.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:23]** Where is this going?

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:29]** And I was singing separate ways, and I went for it, and I sang through the whole thing, and I was so nervous.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:33]** This is for anybody out there that thinks stage fright's a thing.

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** No matter how...

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:59]** experience you get to perform you're always nervous just deal with it and you'll and just use it to your advantage the jitters where the story is going yeah anyway i peed my i peed my pants wow and blew out the sound system so we had to wait 30 minutes before they could change the sound system again so i had time to change my pants and they had time to change the electronics that this is incredible that's a great story


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:02]** That really went from zero to hero real quick.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** I'm sorry.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:07]** I shouldn't laugh at some poor kid's uncomfortabilities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** Oh, man.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** Hey, no.

**[00:10:09 - 00:10:10]** To be honest, it's hilarious.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:10]** Come on.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** You've got to laugh at yourself on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:14]** Uncomfortabilities is not a word.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** I made that up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** Kelly, curveball.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** I'll roll with it.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:17]** Screw it.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** Curveball question.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:19]** Right.

**[00:10:19 - 00:10:23]** How many bowls of cereal do you eat a week, and why aren't you eating more?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:25 - 00:10:31]** Well, I mean, I'm not eating much cereal now, but growing up, I would go down at 2 o'clock in the morning and eat, like, three or four bowls.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** And then for breakfast, I'd have one or two.

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:36]** So there was a period of time where I was eating six bowls a day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** Four bowls of cereal?

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:38]** Yeah.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:38]** I was really hungry.

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:39]** Here's the thing.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:42]** I actually think cereal should be a dessert.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:43]** Yeah.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** I mean, it's not good for you, mostly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** It's terrible for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** Unless it's, like, Weetabix.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** It's sugar.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:48]** Yeah.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:48]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** Weetabix?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:50]** I like Weetabix.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:54]** I've never had Weetabix, but is it, like... Do you know what that is?

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:57]** One time I had Raisin Bran.

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:01]** I ate, like, four of those at once, and I learned that that's not something you should do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** Yeah.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:04]** But, like, that was a bad experience.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** Too much fiber in your diet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:07]** It was bad.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:09]** There's such a thing as too much.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:12]** Also, I would take the 50 tiny elephants thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:15]** Yeah, that was the unspoken question.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** But you're one of the... He would do animal handling on them, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:21]** Yeah, and then control them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:22]** Yeah, I would try.

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:26]** I'd get my good friend Will to get some ball bearings, but that's an old reference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:31]** Speaking of Will, I've got a question.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:35]** If you were a pizza delivery man, how would you benefit from scissors?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:41]** If he was a pizza delivery man, he would be wearing his hat that he's wearing right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:43]** I used to be a pizza delivery guy.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:43]** Really?

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:45]** How would you have benefited from scissors?

**[00:11:46 - 00:11:47]** Um...

**[00:11:49 - 00:12:11]** can't really think of any uh application for me to kill the elephant-sized pigeon see i i would but i have a question about the elephant-sized pigeon yeah okay so is the elephant-sized pigeon's brain like larger like because of this this is such a doctor okay question yeah so can you

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:18]** Does perhaps this elephant-sized pigeon now have a giant brain and he's able to, like, reason?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:19]** I don't think it would make it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** What a terrifying proposition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:25]** Brain size itself doesn't make you any more intelligent.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** No, of course not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** That's true.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:30]** Well, it's just like, I'm going to make a diplomacy check with the elephant-sized pigeon.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:31]** I'm going to talk to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:33]** With the wrinkles in the brain.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** No, it's not that, is it?

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** I don't know what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:37]** We don't know how that matters.

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Well, okay.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** I'm just saying words.

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:41]** I think it's just called pigeon matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:44]** That's my question for any neuroscientists out there.

**[00:12:44 - 00:12:46]** Bloody neuroscientists who want to win the Nobel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:46 - 00:12:47]** Yeah, please hit us up on Instagram, Twitter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:51]** Tell me if an enlarged pigeon is smarter than a smaller pigeon.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** That's a really good question.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** Or a normal-sized pigeon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:56]** That is a good question.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** That is a good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:00]** Let's play.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:01]** Let's do it.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** Let's do it.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:02]** Let's play.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Let's play.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:08]** And on that note, speaking of unrelated transitions, we're going to play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:12]** I wonder what size brain these baddies have.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:16]** You reveal the map, and there is 50 pigeon-sized elephants.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** How did you know?

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** You knew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:21]** This is good.

**[00:13:21 - 00:13:22]** This is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** Rick's full diplomacy.

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:27]** Were these little Galaga things here before?

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** These little, like, dudes?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:31]** Yeah, so if you're looking at the landing page, I updated the landing page.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:33]** You updated it since last time.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:35]** Yeah, because there are no longer four pots.

**[00:13:35 - 00:13:36]** I love it.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:36]** Landing page.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:56]** oh those are the two guys that we're fighting right now and and kev i i took your your suggestion to change the order of the players so then it goes player one and then you know doctor okay then player two and yeah yeah wow that's good good wait is this in turn order right now this is all nobody can see that would be awesome but no it's not it's not in turn order

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** I wanted to say something real quick before you guys started.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:06]** So think about the fact that you guys left the ship that you're like, oh, wow, this is not the situation that we thought.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:11]** And then you fly in these escape pods of which you have no control.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:12]** I'm just freewheeling this recap.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:14]** I didn't even write the recap.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:16]** That's how good it is.

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:17]** Candid John.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:18]** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:14:18 - 00:14:20]** So I'm going to send it.

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:24]** So you were sent catapulting through some space.

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** You can't see anything around you.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:28]** And as Kev pointed out last time, I think it was Kev.

**[00:14:28 - 00:14:29]** It might have been Dasha.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Okay, that's cool.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:38]** Of all the places, you land in like four perfectly slotted chambers for these escape pods.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:38]** What does that mean?

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:40]** You guys get out.

**[00:14:40 - 00:14:43]** You're in this sterile looking room.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:52]** with this pulsing violet purple light, but there are these vibrations, the shaking that happens.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** It seems like this room or whatever's around it.

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:55]** It's unstable.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:56]** Who knows?

**[00:14:58 - 00:15:09]** And then as you're investigating this door that has these strange glyphs on it, that you guys realize these glyphs can be replicated with your, with one five fingered five digit hand, uh,

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:30]** Not only does Dr. OK realize that the door has some sort of trap system, but that also that there's a trap in the ceiling and these observer security robots with these two long metal tentacles come down and you guys are in combat.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:34]** And I just, I wanted to tell you guys in general that

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:36]** Because we're in book two land now.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:40]** We're not in book one land where things were nice and fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** Is that how you describe it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:43]** Yeah.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:43]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** Perfect description.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:46]** Perfect description.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:52]** I don't know if you guys remember back to, I don't know, two episodes ago when I was like screaming my head off because I was so scared about what was going to go on.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** Yeah.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:54 - 00:16:05]** I just want to say, and I think I wrote these words like months ago, but I was like, you all need to be very, very careful and deliberate about your moves here.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:06]** In book two?

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** It's like in general.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:10]** Oh, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** Got to think.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:11]** Okay.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:13]** What's the name of book two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:13 - 00:16:14]** I'm not going to say that.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Can you tell us the name of book one?

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:16]** You know what?

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:18]** I can tell you the name of book one.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** Thanks for that preloaded question, Kev.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:26]** He's not going to tell us, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** He's going to move on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:30]** The name of book one is Fifteen Pigeon-Sized Elephants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:35]** Okay, this is the episode title right there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:39]** 50 Pigeon-Sized Elephants.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:43]** Yeah, no, the name of it is The Chimera Mystery.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Ooh, that makes a lot of sense.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:47]** Oh, that is...

**[00:16:47 - 00:17:17]** book one but we're not in book one we are in book two where i'm pretty sure that we ended last time where dr okay uh found out some information about these robots and then rick decided to delay or ready in action sorry until right after he was attacked and then with that it was the robot's turn and the robot said you know what

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:20]** I'm going to attack Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:26]** But before I forget, remind me, I need to look at the relic, because now I can speak it, and so can you.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:27]** We can both speak Acklo.

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:34]** I pointed at Dr. O'Keefe, and I know you guys can't see me, because you're listening, and we don't have eyes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:36]** Yeah, he was pointing at the visual.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** I saw it.

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:44]** But I also want to go re-inspect the escape pods.

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:46]** The relic.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:46]** The escape pods.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:49]** Is there a TV screen that was on there?

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:52]** Is there another door in?

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:54]** We're still inside some kind of simulation.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:55]** I don't like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:55 - 00:17:55]** Yeah.

**[00:17:55 - 00:18:01]** Well, whoever's controlling roll 20 on this giant TV screen in front of us, roll over.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** Yeah.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** Looking at the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:07]** Nice squarish room.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:08]** Rectangle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** Yeah.

**[00:18:09 - 00:18:13]** And I believe we ended with the robot pulled out this.

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:16]** This pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** It's so ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** Actually, I have my battle axe out, so I'm swinging it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:21]** And I'm going to roll.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:22]** You're going to roll here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:23]** No, because you said he pulled out.

**[00:18:23 - 00:18:24]** That's the action.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** You pulled out your gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** That's not how that works.

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** It's all part of it.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** It's all part of it.

**[00:18:31 - 00:18:33]** To move action, he's going to attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:34 - 00:18:35]** Okay.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:37]** It's kind of comical that he pulled out a pistol, but whatever.


## Speaker_0

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:42]** Just out of his fucking container inside of himself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:47]** Big, big UFO-looking alien with tentacles, pulls out a gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:47]** Hey!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:49]** It's nine minute me time.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** What are you doing?

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:55]** Cocks it back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:57]** He holds it sideways like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:01]** You're in the wrong part of town, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:04]** And then fireworks start going off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:06]** And then fireworks start going off.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:09]** That's what it looks like.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:09]** Oh, man.

**[00:19:09 - 00:19:10]** This is good.

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:10]** Oh, man.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** Query to Rick19.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:14]** Query.

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:21]** Does a 14 hit...

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:25]** your... I believe it's going to be EAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:26]** Oh!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:28]** Yeah, it hits EAC.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:29]** Oh, it does?

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:34]** Wait, let me double-check, because this is important, because I want to check and see if it's... It's a tactical pistol, so no, it's KAC.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:36]** I didn't say it was a tactical pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:40]** I'm just assuming, because why else would you pull a pistol out of a robot?

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** You assume you make an ass of me.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:43]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:43]** How much did you hit me for?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:45]** Oh, that hits?

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:52]** Alright, so as it comes out, you hear like... And if anybody at some point...

**[00:19:52 - 00:20:01]** Just going to say if somebody wants to do a wisdom check on their turn, maybe try and see what this weapon might be.

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:08]** Right now, that is going to be three points of non-lethal damage.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:09]** Non-lethal.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:20]** As this cone comes out, and I picture it kind of like a bunch of rings that spread out and expand, and then it hits you and wraps around you.

**[00:20:20 - 00:20:22]** Like the opening of A New Hope?

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:25]** It sounds like as it comes across.

**[00:20:28 - 00:20:29]** That's exactly what it sounds like.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:30]** Weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:33]** Is it the end of the robot's turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:34]** That's a good question.

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:35]** Cause you know what?

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:41]** I think the, the robot is now going to move.

**[00:20:41 - 00:20:48]** I can't, you can't see it on world 20 here, but the robot shoots and then is going to wait, wait, wait, wait, question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:51]** It shot at me using a range weapon and standing right next to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** You're right.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:56]** It occurs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:00]** Doesn't Nico also get an attack of opportunity or no?

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:02]** That's a good question.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:03]** Let's see.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:07]** Because he's standing next to it as well, almost flanking it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:08]** Almost.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:12]** I'm going to say that, Rick, you'll probably get the attack of opportunity on it.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** Because I feel like it's a movement thing.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:17]** Sorry, it's a shooting thing.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** It's not a moving thing.

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:21]** So I feel like, Rick, you would get the attack of opportunity on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:23]** Yes, I definitely get an attack of opportunity.

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:24]** I'm trying to figure out the flanking thing.

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:33]** So when in doubt, whether two characters who threaten an opponent flank it, trace a line between the two attackers' centers.

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:40]** If the line passes through the opposite borders, so yes, the robot is flanked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:43]** So he's got a negative penalty to AC, right?

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:45]** You get a plus two to your attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** Plus two to my attack.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:46]** Plus two to your attack.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:49]** And then we have to look at attack of opportunities?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:51]** I already said that.

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:53]** I already ruled that you're going to get one.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:54]** Nico's not going to get one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** Nico does not get one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:56]** Nico does not get one.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:56]** All right.

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:59]** If you disagree, listeners, write in.

**[00:21:59 - 00:22:01]** Or don't, because I won't change my mind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:02 - 00:22:03]** Because he's trying to distract me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:07]** It would make sense that the person being attacked gets the attack of opportunity.

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:11]** If the robot was moving out of both of your squares, then you would both get one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:18]** You guys have never seen the TikTok of the guy with the arrows in the five-foot square?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:20]** Yeah, but that's moving in a five-foot square.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:25]** I'm saying it's... Yeah, and he shows, like, if you pull an arrow in a five-foot square, you are, like, opening yourself up to attack.

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:27]** But this robot's not pulling an arrow, just a gun.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:27]** He's shooting a gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** It's a ranged weapon.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:29]** No.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:31]** By the rules... That's what I'm saying.

**[00:22:32 - 00:22:36]** Anyways... Bam!

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:38]** That's an 18 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:40]** Yeah, that is a hit.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:42]** Plus five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:42 - 00:22:43]** Yeah, so what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:43 - 00:22:44]** With a plus two...

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** Dang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:47]** That is 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:53]** He takes a shot in the shoulder, but he uses that momentum to swing his axe backwards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** Oh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** He was about to scrape into the floor, but he's already got two hands.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:04]** I feel like the non-lethal damage gave you a dead arm a little bit, but you just swing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** swings through.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:06]** I love it.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:09]** So that is going to be one D12 plus four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:11]** A D12 plus four?

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** That's ridiculous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:13]** D12 plus four.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:14]** Do it.

**[00:23:14 - 00:23:16]** Sorry, it's still dark in this room.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** Do it.

**[00:23:17 - 00:23:18]** This is a D12, right?

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:18]** This is weird.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** Yes.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** Bam.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:22]** John can see it from across the room.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:22]** I can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:23]** I can totally see it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:28]** Five plus four is nine points of slashing damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** Wow, that is...

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:32]** Pretty bad actually.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:41]** So as it swings, you see it hit the floating orb part and it just moves sideways and then kind of tries to recenter back.

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:51]** And you can see a lot of the metal there is damaged and there's electricity kind of sparking out because you just cracked through the whole of this thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:54]** Does the light turn from blue to red or does it stay blue?

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:56]** Whatever you want it to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:56]** Well, no, you tell me.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:57]** Okay, it turns.

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** It's blue on the picture, but it's red.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:00]** All right.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:05]** I would like to open up a rules court.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:05]** About what?

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:08]** Does the rule say that Nico gets one, too?

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:08]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:09]** Yes!

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** Because why?

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:10]** Thank you, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:11]** Read the thing?

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** Back it up, the rules lawyer.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:22]** When the opponent in a space you threaten makes a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against the opponent.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:22 - 00:24:23]** Nico has a sword in one hand.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:24]** He has a melee weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:26]** Boom!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:27]** You do get an AOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:29]** Thank you, Will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:31]** I think this might be my first attack.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:33]** I was trying to distract you.

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:34]** I'm just making a ruling.

**[00:24:34 - 00:24:35]** And Will decided to look it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:38]** Will was hired into the rules firm.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** Let's see here.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** My melee weapon.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:41]** The rules firm.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:43]** I'm an intern.

**[00:24:43 - 00:24:45]** Your name is going to be on this building in no time.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:45]** Yeah.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:47]** That was really good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:48]** You're going to the top, kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:50]** We'll put a big W on the wall for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:53]** That's good.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:54]** All right, Nick.

**[00:24:54 - 00:24:55]** What's your roll?

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:58]** Nick, you just turned it over like three times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:58]** No, I didn't.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** I turned it sideways three times.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:01]** Are you sure about that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:03]** Yes, because I couldn't read it.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:05]** Kelly, can you verify that?

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** Yeah, totally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:07]** It was a 16.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:08]** Dang it.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** It was a 16.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:11]** All right, so what happens because you hit?

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:12]** All right.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:20]** So at this point, Nico just kind of seeing this thing drop out of nowhere and feeling the thing tilt from side to side.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:24]** He's just going to lash out and just pure just rage.

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:25]** Just rage.

**[00:25:25 - 00:25:25]** Oh, wow.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:27]** And he's just going to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:49]** slash up in frustration from left hip all the way up to right shoulder nice so you cut through i feel like some of the arms and into the underbelly of this robot as you see some pieces of metal clink clink clink fall to the ground as your sword just like cuts through them like butter i love that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:25:49 - 00:25:52]** So I'm rolling a D6, if I'm not mistaken.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:53]** It is.

**[00:25:53 - 00:25:54]** I think you're mistaken.

**[00:25:54 - 00:25:55]** I think it's a D2.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** You know what, John?

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** Stop trying to save your characters.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:58]** Nick, just roll your dice.

**[00:25:58 - 00:25:59]** Why are you talking?

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:01]** Oh, max damage.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:03]** Woo!

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:03]** Sorry, John.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:05]** I got a little too excited.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:06]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:08]** To the robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** You can get excited next.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:09]** Okay.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:10]** No plus zero.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** It's plus zero.

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:18]** You can tell that this robot is having some trouble staying afloat because it has just been hit twice from shooting.

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:20]** Well done.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:21]** It is now.

**[00:26:21 - 00:26:23]** Let's keep this battle rolling.

**[00:26:23 - 00:26:28]** I'm going to change this music as Dr. Okay tells us what he's going to do.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** False.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:29]** Oh.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:31]** Because I held my action.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:33]** Rick19 is going to tell us what he's going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** So I take a swing at it and hit it.

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:37]** And then you see Nico hits it from behind.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:38]** And then you're like, that's my kill.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:40]** So you swing at Nico.

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** And then I rev that battle axe up again.

**[00:26:41 - 00:26:44]** And I still have my flanking bonus.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** Oh, man, this is low.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:53]** That's a three plus a five for eight plus two is ten.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:53 - 00:27:09]** So as you swing through after the first time and then Nico comes through and cuts the underbelly, you're swinging your axe and it drops trying to stabilize and the axe just goes right over the robot.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** Oh, come on.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:12]** And unfortunately fatally hits Nico.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:13]** False.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:15]** That's not how that works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:19]** John is trying very, very hard to kill me right now, and I'm not appreciative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:19 - 00:27:22]** I tried a lot in book one, and I wasn't successful.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** You got close a couple times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:27]** I remember a bar cast, like, trying to take a bite out of him.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:28]** Bar cast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:29]** Good call.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:36]** I'm going to now put your, I'm going to change your initiative order, because now you are right behind that robot.

**[00:27:36 - 00:27:36]** Dr.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:39]** O.K., what are you doing on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:46]** Uh, seeing all of this, uh, I'm confused about what this creature is.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:52]** And, uh, can I, you mentioned a wisdom check or can I do a life science?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:57]** Well, you, last time I let you just go through with the life science and I told you what it was.

**[00:27:57 - 00:27:59]** That was an observer class security robot.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:03]** And I gave you a couple of things about it.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:05]** I think I told you that it has like construct immunities.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:09]** It's vulnerable to critical hits, vulnerable to electricity.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:12]** And you can do a wisdom check.

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:17]** I'll give it to you for free to see what kind of would you have seen from where you are?

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:22]** Because just for the listeners, these two robots are kind of surrounded by Rick Nico.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** It's close quarters.

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Dr. OK.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:24]** And here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:24]** Yeah.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:29]** I'm a few feet away or nine feet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:30]** One square.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:35]** So, but line of sight.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:35]** Rick, did you just move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** Yeah, you didn't let me finish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:38 - 00:28:39]** I used my attack.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:41]** Why didn't you just say, by the way, I move up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:45]** I wasn't going to say it out loud because you could just see me and like, yeah, I moved.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** Well, the listeners need to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** That's important detail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:49]** Okay, so after Rick swings and misses.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** And misses.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** He stumbles over.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:52]** He's going to take one step sideways.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:52]** Stumbling.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:55]** So now he is adjacent to both robots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:56]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:56 - 00:28:59]** Clearly flanking using Nico on one.

**[00:28:59 - 00:28:59]** That's pretty smart.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:01]** And easily flanking from the other using.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:03]** You're not technically flanking the other one.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:03]** Not yet.

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:04]** Not yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:07]** But if he hears our Dr. Okay step forward, I will be flanking the other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:08]** All righty.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:09]** Dr. Okay, what do you do?

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** You want to make that wisdom check?

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** That's the end of my turn.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** Okay, make a wisdom check.

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:14]** D20, add your wisdom bonus.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** That is...

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:17]** 13.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** 13.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:19]** I'll say that's enough.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:24]** You recognize this gun from where you are and the way it's shot as a pulse caster pistol.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:30]** This gun is clearly a gun that is meant to deal non-lethal damage, meant to stun targets.

**[00:29:31 - 00:29:33]** Do with that what you will.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:39]** Seems like we're in a trap and these bots mean to subdue us but not kill us.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:43]** But I won't stand for that.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:48]** I'm going to move up to flank.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:49]** Okay.

**[00:29:50 - 00:29:51]** Oh, okay.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:54]** Actually, I'm not going to move up to flank yet.

**[00:29:54 - 00:30:00]** I'm going to shoot it first because I have my cost jet liquidator drawn.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** Okay.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:08]** I'm going to shoot first and then move into the square because then I won't incur attack of opportunity.

**[00:30:08 - 00:30:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:09]** Okay.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** Makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:10]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:11]** Wait, wait, wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:13]** You're going to shoot first.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:13]** Yeah.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** That makes sense.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:14]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:15]** Yeah.

**[00:30:15 - 00:30:15]** Got it.

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:16]** Shoot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** Shoot your shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:33]** And I'm going to, I mean, supposedly, you know, this should work for robots too, the biohacks, because everything in the Starfinder universe is kind of, you know, connected, interconnected, so to speak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:33]** That is true.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:39]** Well, so from what you know, I don't know what you're trying to do, but remember that has construct immunities.

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** There are some things that it might not do.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** I'm not trying to stop you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:50]** Okay, so I was going to hit it with a basic inhibitor biohack, which hinders a creature's physiological or material function.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:55]** The effect of an inhibitor lasts for a number of rounds equal to three plus your key ability score.

**[00:30:55 - 00:30:58]** Modifier, minimum of one round unless it states otherwise.

**[00:30:59 - 00:30:59]** Okay.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:06]** So I'm going to try and reduce target AC by two if I success.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:11]** I don't see that as something that wouldn't in contract immunity.

**[00:31:11 - 00:31:13]** So, yeah, I think that's that's good.

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:16]** Actually, I can't read it.

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:17]** Does a 12 do it?

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:19]** Does a 12 do it?

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:20]** You shoot.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:23]** Sorry, that's a melee weapon or a ranged weapon?

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:24]** This is the ranged weapon.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:33]** Yeah, so you shoot and it flies past the robot and hits some of the metal panels that are up above the portholes that you guys climbed out of.

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:36]** And you can see the metal kind of like...

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:40]** Like moves and gets all bent and twisted as all these failure modes come in.

**[00:31:41 - 00:31:41]** Oh, no.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** If only that had hit the robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:46 - 00:31:49]** So what do you do?

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** I'm going to move up.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:50]** You're going to move up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** Okay.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:53]** Doesn't he have to take a guarded step to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:56]** No, it's just when you're leaving a threatened square.

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:56]** It's only leaving.

**[00:31:57 - 00:31:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:57 - 00:32:00]** When you're leaving a threatened square, you can enter a threatened square now.

**[00:32:00 - 00:32:01]** And that's what happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:02]** AOPs.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:02]** Or wait.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:03]** Attack.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:03]** AOOs.

**[00:32:04 - 00:32:05]** Yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** I said AOs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:07 - 00:32:09]** It is Hears' turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:11]** What are you doing, Hears?

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:13]** Okay, so rules sidebar real quick, Kevin.

**[00:32:14 - 00:32:17]** You were saying that flanking was going to be helpful to you.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:17]** Why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:25]** So flanking, if you and another character are opposite of over a character, right?

**[00:32:25 - 00:32:30]** As long as you can draw a straight line from the center of your character to the other character, then you are flanking.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:33]** If you're flanking, you get a plus two to all your attacks.

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:35]** If they're melee attacks.

**[00:32:35 - 00:32:43]** But be careful, don't do magic, or this is a super meta game, don't do magic or ranged attacks, because then those will incur attacks of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:48]** So my next turn, I have to put away my Cust Jet and pull out the melee.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:49]** Got it.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:53]** So it's good if you flank and you're both doing melee attacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:58]** Otherwise, anything ranged or magic occurs an attack of opportunity automatically.

**[00:32:58 - 00:32:59]** Well, you have the Dueling Sword.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:01]** I do have the Dueling Sword.

**[00:33:01 - 00:33:02]** Dueling Sword!

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:02]** But Dr.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:04]** O.K., for the viewers, Dr. O.K.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:07]** is already directly opposite of Rick, so he's flanking for him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:12]** Both of us are flanking currently, so if you stepped into flank, you would be flanking with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:16]** You could flank the other robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:21]** Well, couldn't he move right next to, in between Dr. O.K.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:22]** and myself and flank?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:27]** But, like, none of us gain bonuses from him adding to the flanks.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:27]** No.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:31]** And he's a distance fighter anyways, so he should just stay back.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:32]** Super metagaming.

**[00:33:32 - 00:33:33]** Okay, roll.

**[00:33:33 - 00:33:34]** Back to gaming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:34]** No, no, it's good.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:34]** It's good.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:36]** It's informative, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:37]** Fun sidebar.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:38]** Back to the real game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** Fun sidebar.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:39]** What are you doing here?

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:40]** Very nice.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:44]** So what Hears is going to do is, and the next question is this.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** I can see where they are, right?

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:46]** Or I know where they are.

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:49]** Because it supposedly is, like, dim or dark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** Oh, it is dim.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:51]** It is dim.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:53]** Oh, why didn't I roll any of this?

**[00:33:53 - 00:33:54]** Thanks, Hears.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:56]** You said it was a minus two.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** This is not to my advantage.

**[00:33:57 - 00:33:58]** It's a minus two.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:58]** It's 20% concealment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:58 - 00:34:00]** 20% concealment, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:01]** Well, we can go back.

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:11]** No, but this is good, actually, because I think the people that it is concealment for, as I check my notes, is... No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:13]** I have dark vision, but I don't know if I have low light.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:15]** Yeah, so dark vision for dim light, I think, removes the concealment.

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:17]** I think it's for everybody except Hears and Niko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:20]** So I have... No, I have low light vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:24]** Yeah, so everybody except for Hears and Niko don't need to roll 20% concealment.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:26]** They need to roll 20% concealment.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:28]** But you have blind sense, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:34]** It says I have to succeed at a perception check to notice an unseen creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** But these are seen creatures.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:38]** But also, it's a 20% chance.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** It's a 20% concealment chance.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:46]** So basically, you would need to roll a 20 or under on your attack, I think, because you are susceptible to the dim light.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:51]** Because the blind sense, I think, only elevates your level of awareness, but you can already see them.

**[00:34:51 - 00:35:15]** so it's just a concealment thing whereas it's like dark vision is the only thing that matters now whether you have dark vision or not okay pretty sure i'm reading that right like blind sense would help you if there was like something invisible or something cloaked you yes you would know their location and then would be able to make a perception check whereas nico would just not know okay because nico doesn't have uh because nico's human that makes sense you should have rolled a d100 on my turn

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:17]** Yeah, we'll just let it go for now.

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:18]** I have a third question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:18 - 00:35:38]** So basically, I'm either used to firing magic missiles, which always hit no matter where they are, and I can go around things, or I'm used to buffing other people with supercharged weapons, but I have this new attack called... It is called Overheat, and I want to use that, but I'm wondering... I see this, like, robot.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:40]** Yeah.

**[00:35:40 - 00:35:43]** Can I hit him here, or is Dr. Okay in the way?

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** Because...

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:47]** I don't think it has cover from a spell.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:49]** Okay, so it's fine where I'm at, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:49]** I'm pretty sure.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:52]** Unless overheat says something otherwise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:53]** It looks fine.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:55]** It says a cone-shaped burst, though.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** Am I going to screw him over?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** Oh, you might hit Dr. Okay, then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:58 - 00:36:02]** I'm going to move up here, then, to the top.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** Oh, overheat is an attack.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** I thought overheat was when you're like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:10]** If you do that, you're going to hit Dr. O'Keefe and Rick.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:10]** So as he tries to step up.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:11]** All right.

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:13]** Well, it's time for Magic Missile then, to be honest.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:16]** So let's do Magic Missile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:18]** Magic Missile does not occur in AOL, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:19]** Don't see why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** But they're so far away.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** It's a ranged spell attack.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:21]** It should occur.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:28]** So, yeah, he's... But he's not in... In that other game, 5e, it doesn't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:30]** Magic Missile doesn't just because it's a super special?

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** I'm looking at it right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:33]** You're looking at 5e?

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** We're not playing 5e.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:36]** Yeah, I thought we could just play real quick.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** We'll just jump in and about.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:38]** I do my rogue thing.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** Yeah, there's nothing that says that.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:42]** I'm going to do some ball bearings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:43]** Got it.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** So I'm going to do two things.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:48]** I'm going to take your suggestion earlier to roll a wisdom check because I don't think anyone did that yet about the weapon.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:49]** Is that correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** Dr. K did it.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** It's a pulse caster pistol.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** Okay, good, because my roll is low anyway.

**[00:36:53 - 00:36:54]** No worries.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:54]** Perfect.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:59]** Okay, so I did not roll that because I heard in time that John said that.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:01]** So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a full action.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:02]** Yep, for sure.

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:05]** And then I'm going to fire three magic missiles is what I'm going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:06]** Which one?

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:09]** The one that's in between Dr. Okay and Rick or the one that's already damaged by Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:11]** The one that's in between Dr. Okay and Rick.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:14]** So that's a 3d4 plus one.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** So let's do that.

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:45]** there we go so that's uh four and four and six so seven uh four four six eight plus six is okay whatever the hell eight plus six is 14 14 damage wait plus six oh because plus two plus two plus two yeah damn all right plus one plus one plus one whatever all right four four six so what does that look like what are you doing oh shit no no no sorry that should be i rolled it i rolled a six sorry

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:45]** I screwed up.

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:47]** 4 and 4 and 2?

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:47]** 4, 4, 2.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:49]** I rolled a D6.

**[00:37:49 - 00:37:51]** So, yeah, 10.

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:51]** 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:51 - 00:37:53]** Okay, got it.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:53]** Cool.

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:53]** No worries.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:54]** Good compromise.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** So, what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:56 - 00:38:01]** Oh, so here's a... Well, here's just kind of like...

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:20]** says your guns look dumb because they do look dumb so then he just kind of like fires missiles they kind of wrap around dr okay and i have a feeling like dr okay feels like exactly like that and here's here's that he's like yeah that was me thank you here's you're welcome

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:23]** And then I hit some right in the belly.

**[00:38:23 - 00:38:24]** Yeah.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** And saucer shaped body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:25 - 00:38:31]** And you see all three magic missiles come up and the arms just flail wildly as it's totally off balance.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:34]** All of its like sensors are trying to calibrate and stay still.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:40]** And a bunch of stuff from inside just falls down to the ground because you did a lot of damage to it.

**[00:38:40 - 00:38:42]** A lot of damage to it.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** It's still up, though?

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:46]** It's still up, but they look pretty bad.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:47]** Yeah, I'm telling you guys, you got to be careful.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:48]** Well done.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** You want to do anything else with your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:51]** I think that's my full turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** Okay.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:53]** All right.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:54]** What does it do?

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:57]** What does it do?

**[00:38:57 - 00:38:58]** What does it do?

**[00:38:58 - 00:38:59]** What does it do?

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:02]** It is now the one that you just hit.

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:03]** It is its turn.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:17]** And what I'm thinking is that it is going to... Another panel slides open.

**[00:39:17 - 00:39:19]** What's coming out now?

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:23]** And you hear... Like...

**[00:39:23 - 00:39:32]** As this object flies over Dr. Okay to land right in front of the door.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:33]** Right there.

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:34]** Roll.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:35]** It did a thing.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:37]** That thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:37 - 00:39:40]** Dare I say, grenade?

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:42]** From the wall?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:45]** Wait, the panel was on the wall or the panel was on the robot?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:45]** The robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** Oh, okay.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:46]** That makes a lot more sense.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:48]** The room's attacking us now.

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** The room's attacking us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:51]** I wouldn't be surprised in this room.

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:52]** I would not be surprised in this room.

**[00:39:52 - 00:40:01]** I mean... So it lands, explodes, and this weird blue stringy-like substance comes out.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:07]** And I'm going to need... Here's Dr. Okay and Nico to give me a reflex save.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:08]** Okay.

**[00:40:08 - 00:40:17]** As this material comes and lands on your body, lands all over your body, and you feel this weird weight.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:20]** However much of it hits you, you feel this weird weight come down.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:22]** It's 11 for here.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** 11 for here.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:25]** That's going to be 16.

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:26]** 16.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:28]** All of you.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:55]** feel this weight come on you here is you almost feel like it just traps your feet but you at the last second are able to rip out your feet and you are not entangled but it almost got you entangled from a sticky bomb grenade and then it is going to take a guarded step and it is going to move away from you all alright unfortunately didn't get hit Nico it's your turn


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:40:55 - 00:41:03]** So Nico Ryan is just going to, after taking that slash up, he's going to take a guarded step back.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Uh-huh.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:07]** And he's going to whip around with his azimuth laser pistol.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:08]** Yep.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:09]** Which is in the other hand, right?

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:10]** Yep.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:10]** Yep.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** And he's going to take a shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** He's going to take a shot at which one?

**[00:41:13 - 00:41:14]** The one that was already damaged?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:15]** Yeah, the one that was already damaged.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** But you took away my flanking.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:20]** It's really close to dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:20 - 00:41:22]** Hands off the chest piece.

**[00:41:23 - 00:41:26]** Here's the math and the reasoning behind this move.

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:30]** Usually you should just take a slice here.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** First, I get a plus four.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:40]** I have a plus four to any type of ranged attack as opposed to only a plus one.

**[00:41:41 - 00:41:42]** That's the first thing.

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:45]** The second thing is...

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:47]** I still have a 20% chance of missing.

**[00:41:47 - 00:41:48]** I need to roll over a D100.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:55]** So how this works is I roll my attack, my D20 attack, as I always would.

**[00:41:55 - 00:42:05]** But at the end, John's going to ask me to roll a D100 to see whether or not my shot just goes asunder due to the fact that I can't see in dim light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** In part three, my name's Quickfire, so I have to shoot guns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:09]** All right.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:11]** So, Nico, what do you do?

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:13]** What does Nico do?

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:25]** So Nico, after taking his guarded stick back, as I foresaw before we started this episode, it's time for a double tap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:26]** Wow.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:29]** Nico's the only one excited for that.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** Everyone else is like, all right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:32]** So you're going to fire two shots.

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:37]** So, what's the... Can you explain what double tap does?

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:39]** All right.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:45]** So, double tap, it's... You're not... While you shoot twice, it's not two damage rolls.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:46]** It's one damage roll.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:47]** All right?

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** However...

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:53]** What double tap does do is it adds a plus one to the hit.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:56]** So instead of just the plus four, now it's plus five.

**[00:42:56 - 00:43:08]** And in addition, because my weapon specialty is small arms, instead of adding the plus one to the damage modifier, if I do hit, I get to add the full level.

**[00:43:08 - 00:43:11]** So it's a plus three to the damage modifier.

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:14]** So on a D4, it's the D4 plus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:14]** Nice.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:15]** All right.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:18]** Give me your roll.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:21]** I support your moves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:21 - 00:43:24]** So that's a what?

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:26]** That's an 11 to hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:26 - 00:43:27]** It's an 11 to hit.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** EAC.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:31]** The shots go wild.

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:34]** They ping around the room and they hit you.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:34]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:36]** They don't hit you.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:36]** But they miss.

**[00:43:37 - 00:43:38]** I do a double tap against the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:40 - 00:43:42]** The wall gets visibly upset.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:46]** I got really, really... Throws another grenade.

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:47]** The wall throws another grenade.

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:51]** As Niko was taking the shot, he is yelling in anger.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** Die!

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:55]** Just die!

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:56]** I can't breathe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:59]** And then the shots go wild.

**[00:43:59 - 00:43:59]** The shots go wild.

**[00:43:59 - 00:44:01]** From Kevin here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:09]** We've never been so entertained or like happy at this moment and laughing so much.

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** Kevin is literally laughing.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:13]** I'm pretty sure he's crying right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:19]** He shot the wall and then Will's like, did the wall throw another grenade?

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:22]** I'm sorry.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:23]** I'm crying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:28]** This is so good.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** Hey, it was a good tip, man.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:30]** I liked it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:31]** Hey, we all got to try.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** We got to try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:34]** Quickfire.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:34]** Quickfire.


## Speaker_0

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:35]** Quickfire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:37]** Speedish mixture of dance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:37 - 00:44:38]** Amazing.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:40]** The magic man.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:41]** Now you see me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:41]** Magic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Now you don't.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:45]** Now you don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:46]** Amazing.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:47]** That was great.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:48]** That was great, Will.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:48]** That was good.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:49]** Yeah, that was very good.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:51]** All right.

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:54]** It is going to be the top.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:56]** Rick's turn, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** No, I held my action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:01]** Oh, it's the second round.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:03]** It's the other robot.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:13]** As Nico shoots, one of the bullets seems to just hit something on like right near the control panel and the lights come back on.

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:21]** So the room is fully lit now is no longer dimly lit.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:26]** The security robot is going to... Let's see.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:29]** I think it can... John, might I interject for just a moment?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:30]** Might you.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** It seems like I'm the magic man now.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:36]** Now I see... Now you see me?

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:38]** Now you don't.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:40]** Well, it's the opposite.

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:41]** Please cut this.

**[00:45:41 - 00:45:42]** This didn't work.

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:44]** That did not work.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** You didn't see me.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** Please cut this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Please leave this in.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:49]** I'm definitely going to leave that in.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:50]** This did not work.

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** So sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:55]** The robot that you try to shoot at takes a guarded step.

**[00:45:55 - 00:46:05]** You see it kind of like turn and like sway back as it tries to balance itself and move away from Dr. OK and Rick in a way that allows it to not get hit.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:12]** And as it does that, it's going to turn its pistol and point it at Nico.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:15]** So it's going to be doing the five feet.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:16]** So I think we're good in terms of movement.

**[00:46:16 - 00:46:17]** What do you know?

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** John's targeting me again.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** Yep.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** You know it.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** You know it.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:27]** All right, how does... All right, I don't think so, but does 24 hit?

**[00:46:28 - 00:46:28]** Sorry, 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:33]** Save your false modesty, John.

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:34]** You feckless wimp.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:34 - 00:46:39]** I'm just imagining these very... They're sort of anthropomorphic in how they do things, like hold guns.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:40]** He's just pointing at you.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** He's like, I must hurry.

**[00:46:42 - 00:46:43]** I have lunch soon.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:48]** So weird, these robots.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:51]** My turkey sandwich is getting cold.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** Yes, the new deli.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:56]** Better than the other deli.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:58]** My co-worker brought potato salad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** I wonder if Song knows them.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** I wonder if Song knows them.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** I wonder if Rick knows them.

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:04]** Do all robots know each other?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:04]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:06]** Well, that's what you said with Song.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** I know all murder bots know each other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:10]** But Song works on the same ship that this is all involved in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:10]** Okay, well.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** So this gun comes out.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:12]** It's possible.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:22]** And these rings, these blue rings grow around you and hit you for five points of non-lethal damage, Nico.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** How original, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:24]** How original.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:25]** Oh, man.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:27]** It is original.

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:27]** You want to know why?

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:29]** Because now it's Rick's turn.

**[00:47:29 - 00:47:30]** Original Rick.

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:31]** Original Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** Sorry, I was reading through Attack of the Solitarities.

**[00:47:32 - 00:47:33]** The original.

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:39]** Do I incur an attack of opportunity if I just move through a threatened square?

**[00:47:39 - 00:47:40]** Because I'm leaving one threatened square.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:40]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:46]** So that is the difference between D&D, where it's like you can stay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** As long as you're still within threatened squares, you can move freely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:53]** Yes, but in Starfinder, my read is that if you move from one threatened square to anywhere, it's an AOL.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:56]** So in that case, Rick is going to take... I kind of like it.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:56]** It makes sense.

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:57]** Yeah, it makes sense.

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:02]** Rick is going to take a guarded step into another threatened square of robot number two.

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** Okay.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:06]** And when he does that, he is... Yep.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** Say again?

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:07]** Yep.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** You agree with what I did?

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** Yep.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:10]** And I am now flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:12]** You are now flanking, correct?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:12]** Yeah.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** So then I'm going to roll to... How is Rick feeling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:19]** Is Rick confident, or is Rick, like, shaken?

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:23]** Is Rick, like... Well, not shaken mechanically, but... I think the best word is steady.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:23 - 00:48:24]** Steady.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:31]** He's so focused on, like, all the BS going on around here that these robots are nothing compared to that.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:32]** Okay.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** And so we're going to roll my d20.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:34]** Okay.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:37]** I got an 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:37 - 00:48:38]** An 11.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:39]** Plus five.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:40]** Plus five.

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:41]** Plus two.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:43]** Plus two with your melee weapon.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:43]** Which is 18.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** You're swinging up.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:47]** Boom, it connects with the robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** He does like an uppercut with it.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:52]** He steps sideways and just slices from underneath.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:52 - 00:48:52]** Wow.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:57]** And you hear this, like, wrenching of metal as you hit the robot.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** How much damage did you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:00]** You want to guess what I roll for that one?

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** We already talked about this.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:01]** Wait, what?

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:03]** It's a D12.

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:03]** Oh, yeah, it's a D12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:05]** This is outrageous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** That's 11 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:11]** So you hit it, and it goes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:13]** It was 11 points of damage from the dice.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:14]** Plus four more.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:15]** So 15 points of damage total.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** Okay.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:27]** That is such an outrageous number that I'm going to say that you hit it, and it literally just flies up, careens up, smashes against the ceiling, and falls down, and it rains down on you, all these bits.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:28]** Perfect.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** My potato salad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** And it is dead.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** Yes!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:38]** Impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:38 - 00:49:39]** Does that mean I killed it?

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:41]** You did kill it.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** Nice killing blow.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:47]** I did it non-lethally.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:47 - 00:49:51]** I non-lethally swing my axe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:53]** What else did you want to do with your turn?

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:53]** No, that was my turn.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** That was your turn.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** Dr. K, it's your turn.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** Okay.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:59]** You see this robot explode after hitting the ceiling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:05]** Well, then, I guess I don't need to use my spear for this foe.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:10]** And I still have my costa jet out.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** You're going to turn and shoot?

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** Yeah, I'm just going to shoot the other one.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** Okay.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:16]** Just going to shoot the other one.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:22]** I'm going to hit it with just the liquidator and its normal attack.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Okay.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:25]** No biohacks.

**[00:50:25 - 00:50:26]** Just the acid damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:27]** Okay.

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:29]** Just the acid damage.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** 15.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:30]** 15 against.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:31]** It's going to be death.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:33]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:34]** He's screwed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:34 - 00:50:35]** It's going to be KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:35]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** Oh, it's 15 to hit.

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:39]** I was like, dang, it's 15 points of damage.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:40]** That's probably good, though.

**[00:50:40 - 00:50:41]** That's 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:41]** The shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:43 - 00:50:43]** What does it sound like?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:48]** I would assume... Like a pressure piston?

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:50 - 00:50:53]** It hits, and it hits the robot.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** Nice.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** There we go.

**[00:50:55 - 00:51:02]** As it starts to eat through the plating that is left on this robot, some of it gets into the circuitry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:12]** Yeah, it just sort of covers... It's sort of like, you know, as we've... It's like a gelatinous blob that's sort of aerodynamically stable.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** Almost like a...

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:19]** like an oval-shaped paintball that just sort of flies through the air and then bursts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:20]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** I'm trying to get the right sound with my mouth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:23]** Keep trying.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:29]** That is... Oh, that was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:30]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** Five points of damage.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** It had five points of health left.

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:39]** You hit it, and it chews through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:42]** It just sort of drips through the entire body of the robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:48]** I feel like it was looking at Nico, and Nico, this thing, hits it, and then it starts to try and stabilize.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:55]** And just hits the ground and is dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:59]** Nico is just in a moment of just absolute fury, is still feeling the shocks.

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:08]** He's just going to walk over to the downed robot, and he's going to take his dueling sword and just start slashing this dead robot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:12]** He's seamless.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:14]** It wasn't going to ever kill you.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:17]** He just walks up to him and tries to hold him back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:17]** It's all right.

**[00:52:17 - 00:52:18]** It's over.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:18]** It's over.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** It's over, Nico.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** Relax, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:25]** Do any of you realize none of us know what's going on right now?

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:26]** None of us.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** I know, I know.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:28]** Do you hear me?

**[00:52:28 - 00:52:29]** You hear me?

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:33]** The games are over.

**[00:52:33 - 00:52:34]** Do you know who I am?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:36]** Nico.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** Hey, hey.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:37]** Orion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Hey there, bud.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** We're going to get him.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:41]** We're going to get him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** None of us know what's going on.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:44]** We were on a chimera.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:46]** Now we were expelled on four escape pods.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:47]** We don't know where we are.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:48]** We're in a box.

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:50]** We were just attacked by two robots.

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** I'm going to lose.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:53]** I've lost my mind.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:55]** None of us know anything.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** None of us.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:58]** And he's just going to storm off to the other side of the corner here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:04]** Nico, I'd also like to point out that these four chambers are right next to each other.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** They are not just escape pods.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** We were channeled here.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:09]** This is suspicious.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:12]** Who has the relic?

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** I got the relic.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** May I see that?

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:15]** What are you going to do with it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:17]** I'm just going to read it.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:20]** I had some time to think about Aklo.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:20]** You can read it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:25]** I have analyzed the hieroglyphics on it, and I believe I can understand it now.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:28]** All right, just give it back when you're done, all right?

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** I don't even need to touch it.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:30]** All right, all right.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:32]** I just need to see it visually.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:32]** All right, come here.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** Let's do it.

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** I'm interested.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** I want to know.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:35]** I got to know.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:36]** All right.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:41]** So Rick is going to take a look at the relic from the Chimera.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:42]** You're going to assist?

**[00:53:43 - 00:53:45]** Yeah, I mean, is it assist or is it a...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** Is it a culture check?

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:49]** What do you want us to roll, Magic John?

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:51]** Additionally, I'd like to inspect those chambers.

**[00:53:51 - 00:53:52]** Yes.

**[00:53:53 - 00:53:55]** They are those screens, you know.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:59]** I believe they may be screens as opposed to actual windows.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:01]** Hold on on your rolls here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** Everybody roll everything.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Don't you dare.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:07]** I'm waiting on my die at once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** Here we go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:18]** This is how we're going to open it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:23]** I love the way that my dice sounds, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:26]** Nice ASMR.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:28]** I'm going to roll for percent.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:28]** Chika-chika.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:29]** Chika-chika.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:49]** skittles taste the rainbow skittles are damn good skittles it's hard to go wrong with them if skittles wants to send us some we'd eat them I mean we could definitely rep skittles I personally like tropical skittles skittles I do like those

**[00:54:49 - 00:55:01]** is that the blue one i think it's blue there's also like a purple one that's like purple one's like berries yeah that one's good too it was tropical and then yeah there's another one i forget but don't send us mint skittles please those aren't those don't count those aren't real


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:06]** Okay, so you walk over, you pull out this piece of metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** He pulls out the metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:12]** Hears pulls out the piece of metal and hands it to Rick.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:15]** Yeah, what do you want me to roll in order to see?

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:19]** If you are starting to speak Akla now officially, you don't need... I don't even need to roll anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:20]** No, because you speak the language.

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:22]** Hey, I recognize that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:24]** Could you imagine if I had to roll if you understood the language?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:25 - 00:55:26]** I mean, I don't know English.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** I'd have to roll.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:31]** I know English, but I'd still have to roll if I was learning Shakespeare or something, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:31 - 00:55:32]** Here's hoping.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:38]** So you grab the piece of metal, you look down, and your android brain puts everything together.

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** Relic removed for recalibration.

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:47]** Install before starting simulation.

**[00:55:47 - 00:56:11]** simulation simulation but we already knew that though no i know but it's verified now it's like oh okay there's also a glyph on the back okay that is not aklo what is it it's like it's some sort of weird geometric symbol it doesn't look like the one that is on the door or the ones that are on the door but it just looks

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:15]** It looks like it's in a similar vein, but you can't make it with five fingers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:18]** Here's Roll's culture check.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:18]** Can I assist?

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:18]** Damn it.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** It's only like 12, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:20]** You're not sure.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:21]** All right.

**[00:56:21 - 00:56:24]** While they do that, Nico's going to start going over there.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:24]** Going over where?

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:26]** Going over by the pods again.

**[00:56:26 - 00:56:29]** He's going to go inspect his escape pod again, see what he can find.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:30]** Yeah, Rick will follow.


## Speaker_0

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:31]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** Wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:32]** Same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:33]** What are you guys thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:34]** Talk to me.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:43]** I want to get out of this simulation, and I'm going to have some words for the management.

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:45]** I want to know what this damn glyph is.

**[00:56:45 - 00:56:46]** Why is everyone walking away?

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:49]** I meant to get to the packed worlds.

**[00:56:49 - 00:56:50]** What is this nonsense?

**[00:56:50 - 00:56:52]** This glyph will help us, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:53]** Hey, guys.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:59]** Rick is going to look at the window that we saw the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:01]** Like the porthole of the escape pod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:04]** Yeah, and he's going to inspect that.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** So I'll roll a perception and go ahead, Hears.

**[00:57:07 - 00:57:08]** I'm sorry for cutting you off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:08]** It's fine.

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:13]** I mean, I'm just a little sad because I want to know what this glyph is.

**[00:57:13 - 00:57:17]** I thought everyone else was interested, but as soon as we could confirm whatever in Aklo, y'all boned off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** You want to know what this glyph is?

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:23]** I read it out loud because I'm new to Aklo, so I was like... Did you just say the word boned off?

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:23]** You boned off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** I guess that's a thing.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:24]** You buggered off.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:27]** And I'm just trying to say... I'm doing a look at the glyph.

**[00:57:27 - 00:57:28]** Hears is like...

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:31]** I can't figure out what it is to any of you who know what this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** What do they roll a culture check?

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:34]** I'm sorry.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** I was just going to say you can roll for it.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:38]** Go ahead.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** Useless to roll for it?

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:42]** It's probably useless to roll for it.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:42]** What am I rolling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:43]** Culture?

**[00:57:44 - 00:57:45]** Yeah, culture.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:52]** So while I'm inspecting the pods, John, I'm rolling both the computers and a perception check.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:53]** Okay.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:55]** For the computers check, it's a 24.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:57]** I got a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:59 - 00:58:00]** Let's separate these two.


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:01]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:02]** Dr.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** O.K., you rolled a 20.

**[00:58:03 - 00:58:03]** Yes.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:04]** You don't know it.

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:05]** What is this glyph?

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** You don't know it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:08]** I'm sorry, Hughes.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:09]** I can't tell you what this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:12]** So, Nico, tell me, like, don't just tell me the rules.

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** Tell me what it is that you're doing.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:15]** Like, what is Nico thinking?

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:15]** Like, what is he feeling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:18]** Nico is, he walked back over to the escape pod.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:23]** He climbs back over and he's just, at first he's just staring.

**[00:58:24 - 00:58:26]** Eerily silent.

**[00:58:28 - 00:58:32]** Han, white-knuckling over his dueling sword, his pistols.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** You're, like, crouched in the escape pod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:44]** And he holsters his pistol, and then he sheathes his dueling sword.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:50]** And he says, Nothing matters but the truth.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:56]** Nothing matters but the truth.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:00]** And then he starts surveying the escape pod.

**[00:59:01 - 00:59:09]** Starts looking at the electrical circuitry, observing if everything's intact.

**[00:59:11 - 00:59:12]** And John, what does he see?

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:16]** He's got a 13 on the roll plus 11 for a grand total of 24.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:19]** On perception?

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:20]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:59:20 - 00:59:21]** Perception was 27.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** Natural 20 plus 7.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:23]** Okay.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:28]** As you're pulling through one of the panels, pull it up.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:32]** And Rick, you said you were going over there to look at your escape pod too?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:36]** Yeah, I'll go into one of the escape pods and look at the screen specifically.

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:37]** Okay.

**[00:59:37 - 00:59:39]** And I say screen because it's definitely not a window.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:40 - 00:59:50]** Okay, so Nico, as you're pulling up one of the panels, you see that on the inside is another marking that says Star Dream 2.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:55]** In all of the ways the escape pod looks like it is, for the most part.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:23]** standard issue for star ship is there any computer on board right it was the previous ship not the ship that was supposedly uh missing was there a computer on board the escape pod too like a very basic computer there is but you try and access it nothing happens i did a 24 on the computer's roll you try and access it nothing happens okay wait did you want me to roll for what i see


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:26]** Well, so you were looking at that, at that porthole.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:26]** Yeah.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]** It's a porthole.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** It's a window.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:32]** It's just like a, like a piece of glass, the tube of the escape pod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:33]** Is it breakable?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:34 - 01:00:35]** Yeah, anything's breakable.

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:36]** What do you do?

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:38]** Like, talk me through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:38 - 01:00:40]** Well, I'm trying to look.

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:41]** So it's just a porthole.

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:47]** I mean, I'll get as close as I can to the porthole and try to see out and around.

**[01:00:47 - 01:00:54]** And if I don't see anything, and I don't think... Like, Rick doesn't think that it is a porthole at this point.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:55]** He thinks it's some kind of screen.

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:57]** This is just like a room on...

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:07]** a planet who knows totally um and so he's willing to like break it okay in order to you see what appears to be the chamber that the escape pod comes into


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:09 - 01:01:12]** So we actually did float around for a period of time, potentially.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]** And then came right back?

**[01:01:13 - 01:01:14]** That's silly.

**[01:01:14 - 01:01:15]** That's not how it works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:18]** That doesn't make any sense.

**[01:01:18 - 01:01:18]** Wait, hold on.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:21]** This isn't where we took off from, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:22]** Well, that's what you were saying.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** So was it on a string?

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:25]** Or on a cable?

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:26]** Did we ever take off at all?

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:28]** Is this what the player is saying or the characters?

**[01:01:28 - 01:01:30]** Is this what the player is saying currently?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:30 - 01:01:32]** Because I'm losing my mind still.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:37]** I'm not sure where or what we have done as far as travel.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:40]** I know that I got to get out of this fucking box.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:46]** Here's just asked to the group, like, is this I can't remember.

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** It was too crazy.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:50]** Like, is this where we got into the escape pods or is this a new room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:53]** This is definitely a new room.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:53]** Okay.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:53]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** However, not crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:55 - 01:02:02]** I remember seeing a ship that was being torn apart that was still connected to the walls as if it was being suspended.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:03]** Me too.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:04]** Did we actually see that?

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:05]** Did we come from a ship?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** Well, what is that?

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** Is that a window?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:08]** Is that a screen?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:10]** I cannot tell.

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]** The portal.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:12]** It appears to be just a window.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:20]** It's at this point, Nico turns and jumps down from the escape pod and decides to enter into the conversation.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** Here's the truth.

**[01:02:22 - 01:02:23]** We are in a box.

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:26]** Someone is playing us for puppets.

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:28]** We don't know what's going on.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:34]** Someone's in control and they don't have our best interest at attack.

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:34]** I have theories.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:36]** I don't know anything.

**[01:02:37 - 01:02:41]** But we need to get moving, and someone's going to pay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:44]** Yes, I agree.

**[01:02:44 - 01:02:45]** I concur.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:49]** It's at that moment that there's another kind of shake.

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:52]** The room kind of shakes a little bit, and then it just comes still.

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:59]** You guys don't really need to stabilize, but you feel the ground shake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:11]** So Nico, with kind of eerily relaxed hands, but still with a clenched jaw, starts walking toward the tunnel entrance.

**[01:03:11 - 01:03:12]** Towards the door?

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:13]** Yeah.

**[01:03:13 - 01:03:14]** On the west?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:15]** Okay.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** What do you do?

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:26]** So as you walk over, ahead of you appears to be, again, just a double door that has flashing purple lights around it.

**[01:03:27 - 01:03:29]** In the center, again, is that screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:31]** Two more robots come out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:31 - 01:03:31]** The camera, right?

**[01:03:32 - 01:03:34]** Well, so over on the control panel on the side.

**[01:03:34 - 01:03:35]** Oh, so it's a clear screen.

**[01:03:35 - 01:03:42]** So the screen is in the center of the door and the screen has like static and it's like showing these symbols.

**[01:03:42 - 01:03:44]** And those are the glyphs that you realize that you can use with your hand.

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:46]** And actually, you can pass this around.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:50]** This is what you're seeing on the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:50 - 01:03:53]** Nico wants to do a computer's check on the control panel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:57]** Yeah, so I'm passing around Kev's old mini iPad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:57 - 01:03:58]** Oh, is it?

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:58]** Aww.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:01]** It looks... Is it a video?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:05]** Nico wants to do the... It took off the really cool...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:09]** Okay, so we see... Dude, the kids are not that cool.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:10]** On the iPad.

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** This is cool.

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:13]** It was very cool.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:16]** Anyway, so, Nico, you walk over.

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** I walk over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:17 - 01:04:19]** I start fingering the control panel.

**[01:04:20 - 01:04:21]** That sounds wrong.

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:29]** My fingers kind of touch... What if we all try to mimic these patterns for ourselves?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:32]** He starts to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:58]** he's gonna roll we got a couple things nick you're talking dr k you're also talking what do you think nico first kind of strokes the keys over the control panel and he's gonna do can he's he's gonna do a computer check and just see if he can't try to do this by instinct okay or by his knowledge by computers are there keys you don't see any keys ty what are you doing nico's just putting his hand on a control panel on the on the side of the door

**[01:04:58 - 01:05:05]** So he's just trying to figure out how to use it to see if he can use his computer skills to access or manipulate that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:09]** What do you... Oh, you're doing a computer check.

**[01:05:10 - 01:05:11]** I can help with that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:12 - 01:05:16]** Sorry, did I ever... I want to hit the glass.

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:18]** Can I hit the glass of the portal?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:19]** Do you want to hit the glass?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:20]** I do.

**[01:05:20 - 01:05:22]** I want to strike the glass.

**[01:05:23 - 01:05:29]** I'll take my battle axe and I'll kind of wedge it up there and just hammer away as hard as I can.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:33]** Do you want to roll a strength or an attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:40]** I'll say that just from hitting it...

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:48]** And just the glass flies out and you hear it as it falls as it falls around the container.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:58]** And as that last hit, your hammer goes through the porthole and it just hits the side of the thing that's holding the pod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:22]** so then can can rick rick is gonna like clear that glass then you know so that the porthole is completely clear of glass because he doesn't want to cut his delicate skin his robotic delicate uh and then he's and then he's gonna try to like put his head up there and see if he can see down you know into the that the outer chamber sure does he see anything so as you put your head up


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:25 - 01:06:31]** You don't like there's nothing particularly there in the air.

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:32]** You just see the chamber.

**[01:06:32 - 01:06:34]** There's like a thin gap.

**[01:06:34 - 01:06:47]** So you barely kind of get your eyes up above the porthole and you're able to look and you see the capsule is really close to the, you know, the chamber that it came into.

**[01:06:47 - 01:06:51]** And you just see darkness past the end of the capsule.

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:55]** And there's a faint smell of smoke and burned things.

**[01:06:56 - 01:07:03]** And maybe in the distance, you, like, hear, like, as, like, something crumbles.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:08]** Dr.

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:09]** O.K.?

**[01:07:09 - 01:07:10]** Yes?

**[01:07:10 - 01:07:12]** Do you still have that grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:13 - 01:07:15]** yes, here you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:07:15 - 01:07:19]** So Dr. Okay was helping me go out.

**[01:07:19 - 01:07:20]** Where'd you get a hand grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:22]** I found it earlier.

**[01:07:22 - 01:07:22]** Okay.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:23]** Yes.

**[01:07:23 - 01:07:24]** Great reference.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:24 - 01:07:31]** So yeah, he kind of climbs out of the, out of the, um, escape pod just enough to like shout out or not even shop and like say to Dr. Okay.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:32]** And he asked for the grenade.

**[01:07:32 - 01:07:33]** Dr. Okay.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:33]** Tosses the grenade to him.

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:34]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:36]** Not, you know.

**[01:07:36 - 01:07:38]** Well, it's not primed.

**[01:07:38 - 01:07:38]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:40 - 01:07:41]** I'll just toss a grenade at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:07:41 - 01:07:42]** Why not?

**[01:07:44 - 01:07:49]** All my military friends, please write in and tell us is it safe to throw a grenade if it's still got the pin in it.

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:50]** Just saying.

**[01:07:50 - 01:08:04]** Anyway, so Rick is going to then go back into the chamber and he's going to pull this pin and he's going to stick the grenade up between the hole and slide it down as far as he can and then dive out of the...

**[01:08:05 - 01:08:08]** And he's going to, like, shout, you know.

**[01:08:08 - 01:08:08]** Fire in the hole.

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:10]** Fire in the hole.

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:11]** Heads up.

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:11]** Get down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:13 - 01:08:17]** Nico, I feel like you're just heads down in the control panel.

**[01:08:17 - 01:08:18]** You're trying to go through on your computer.

**[01:08:19 - 01:08:22]** And I'll resolve that and the grenade.

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:23]** You're typing through.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:29]** It doesn't seem like the computer is really responding to what you want.

**[01:08:29 - 01:08:37]** And it kind of makes sense with the screen that's on the door is just static-y and glitch-y and the computer is not really accessing.

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:42]** If you wanted to, you think to yourself, maybe an engineering check, maybe if I could get behind it.

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:48]** And while you're thinking about that, Rick, you throw the grenade, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

**[01:08:48 - 01:08:58]** And then you hear, and all of you feel the ground beneath you shake a little bit as you hear the grenade.

**[01:08:58 - 01:09:00]** Because again, there are windows on the sides of these four chambers.

**[01:09:01 - 01:09:09]** And for a brief second, there's a flash of that just orange, yellow light as that comes up.

**[01:09:09 - 01:09:11]** And then nothing happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:15]** There's no damage to the end of that escape pod.

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:18]** There's no... It didn't open anything up.

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:20]** It didn't shake anything loose.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:21]** Can I investigate?

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:30]** It seemed like the explosion, maybe, Rick, if you're looking out the window, it seemed like it came from kind of far below you.

**[01:09:30 - 01:09:31]** Oh, my God.

**[01:09:31 - 01:09:32]** That's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:35]** We're just on ropes.

**[01:09:35 - 01:09:36]** This is a Disneyland ride.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:36 - 01:09:43]** Anybody want to... I wanted to investigate the bay in which these butts came from.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:44]** Okay.

**[01:09:44 - 01:09:49]** Here sees Nico trying to do something with engineering and thinks he can help him out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:50]** Okay.

**[01:09:50 - 01:09:55]** So that's a 15 on the engineering check plus whatever the assist is.

**[01:09:55 - 01:09:57]** Here's assist with a 16.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:57 - 01:09:57]** Okay, so that's a plus two.

**[01:09:58 - 01:09:59]** So that's a 17.

**[01:10:01 - 01:10:05]** It seems like you're not quite able to get through it.

**[01:10:05 - 01:10:07]** You are able to take the panel off.

**[01:10:08 - 01:10:11]** Something isn't just quite working just yet.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:17]** You might be able to try again, but that takes you already a couple of minutes just to get it off and then go through the wire.

**[01:10:17 - 01:10:21]** So let's see what, while this is happening, Dr. O'Keefe is starting to go up.

**[01:10:21 - 01:10:21]** Right.

**[01:10:22 - 01:10:27]** So, Dr. K, the ceiling is about 15 feet tall and Rick is looking outside.

**[01:10:27 - 01:10:28]** Here's a Nico.

**[01:10:28 - 01:10:30]** You're standing at the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:30 - 01:10:36]** I believe I have that micro cord that I can possibly turn on.

**[01:10:36 - 01:10:40]** Is there anything I could, like, you know, lasso around and climb up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:41 - 01:10:43]** There's nothing really on the ceiling that you can lasso around.

**[01:10:43 - 01:10:50]** But remember, you did see that part of the ceiling that was flush, like, moved away and kind of irised open.

**[01:10:50 - 01:10:51]** I see.

**[01:10:51 - 01:10:54]** That was what happened when the robots came down.

**[01:10:55 - 01:10:57]** But now it's flush again.

**[01:10:57 - 01:11:01]** It's flush again, but you can tell where the circular outline is of those.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:01 - 01:11:02]** Yeah.

**[01:11:02 - 01:11:03]** Bollocks.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:04]** Bollocks.

**[01:11:04 - 01:11:13]** I think we should try to replicate these hand gestures and see if we can activate something to get us out or to kill more things.

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:13]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:13 - 01:11:14]** You want to do that?

**[01:11:15 - 01:11:17]** So, I mean, yes, I want to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:11:17 - 01:11:25]** With all my appendages and phalanges and all the things, I'm just going to sort of try and mimic those shapes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:25 - 01:11:30]** Because there is a camera that you guys in the control panel, you do see where the camera is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:31 - 01:11:34]** Well, while they're getting ready to do that, we're trying again.

**[01:11:34 - 01:11:35]** Okay.

**[01:11:36 - 01:11:45]** And this time it's a natural 20 on the die plus a 9 for a 29 engineering check plus whatever here's rolls on the assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:45]** Okay.

**[01:11:45 - 01:11:50]** Well, do you want to do that or do you want to do Dr. O'Keefe's trying to get the glyphs?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:11:50 - 01:11:52]** Dr. O'Keefe, we'll let him do the glyphs.

**[01:11:52 - 01:11:54]** We're going to work on the engineering check.

**[01:11:54 - 01:11:55]** And here's roll the 25 to assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:11:56 - 01:11:56]** Okay.

**[01:11:56 - 01:12:00]** And then Dr. O'Keefe, what kind of check is that?

**[01:12:00 - 01:12:04]** That would be probably a... Culture?

**[01:12:05 - 01:12:06]** No, actually, I'd say a computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:08]** Computers check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:12:08 - 01:12:13]** Okay.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:13]** Okay.

**[01:12:13 - 01:12:14]** 24.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:15]** Okay.

**[01:12:15 - 01:12:15]** There you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:16 - 01:12:19]** Both outstanding rolls all around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:23]** So that's a 31 total on the engineering check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:23 - 01:12:37]** As you all... Dr. K, there seems to be something where as you're spoofing, it's not quite coming through, but somehow you kind of combine your hands and for a split second, it seems like it starts to respond.

**[01:12:38 - 01:12:43]** But maybe at that exact moment, Hears and Nico, you guys found the right wire.

**[01:12:43 - 01:12:45]** You kind of clipped the right wire.

**[01:12:45 - 01:12:53]** You're not really quite sure, but there's just this sound of like...

**[01:12:54 - 01:13:21]** like these something inside the wall is trying to push open and then the door kind of slowly opens an inch and then shuts back and then a foot and then shuts back and then tries to go through it again and then can we jam it and the door opens and that's our game


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:24]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:13:24 - 01:13:24]** Of course.

**[01:13:25 - 01:13:26]** That was a good ending.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:27]** Until next time.

**[01:13:28 - 01:13:29]** Until next time.

**[01:13:29 - 01:13:31]** Next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:13:32 - 01:13:34]** Next time on We'll Save.

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:36]** What will the group encounter next?

**[01:13:37 - 01:13:37]** Open doors?

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:39]** More robots in the halls?

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:41]** No one knows.

**[01:13:42 - 01:13:46]** You'll have to check next Wednesday for We'll Save.

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:48]** That was really good.

**[01:13:48 - 01:13:50]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:13:54 - 01:13:55]** Hey everyone, it's Kevin.

**[01:13:55 - 01:13:56]** Welcome back.

**[01:13:56 - 01:14:00]** I know we took that week off to do Plot Armor, which I personally love that episode.

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:15]** I always want to know the workings behind things, and I think it was really cool to flip the table and see how this game is put together and be able to probe John's mind, even though he didn't tell us anything we didn't already know.

**[01:14:15 - 01:14:16]** But we are back.

**[01:14:17 - 01:14:18]** And what do we know?

**[01:14:19 - 01:14:22]** We're finally off the Chimera, and we have that what.

**[01:14:23 - 01:14:30]** We were in that simulation, now we're stuck in this lab, but now the answer is we're looking for who was doing this to us and why.

**[01:14:31 - 01:14:35]** Is it just bad luck that we were snatched up by random, or were we chosen for this?

**[01:14:35 - 01:14:41]** Are we just subjects in some kind of experiment, or are we being tested for something bigger?

**[01:14:41 - 01:14:43]** That's the answers we need to find out.

**[01:14:43 - 01:14:44]** And we're going to.

**[01:14:44 - 01:14:46]** And you're going to be right there with us.

**[01:14:46 - 01:14:48]** Thanks so much for listening.

**[01:14:48 - 01:14:49]** Catch us on social media.

**[01:14:49 - 01:14:51]** We have a Discord now, so jump onto that.

**[01:14:52 - 01:14:56]** As always, thank you to Paizo, Hero Lab, Roll20, Sirenscape.

**[01:14:57 - 01:14:58]** And thanks to our fans.

**[01:14:58 - 01:15:00]** We'll catch you again next We'll Save Wednesday.

**[01:15:01 - 01:15:01]** Kevin?


## Speaker_0

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:35]** Thank you.
