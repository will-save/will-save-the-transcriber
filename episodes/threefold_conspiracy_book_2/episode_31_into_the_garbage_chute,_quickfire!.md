## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:00:00 - 00:00:09]** Last time on We'll Save, our group was ambushed by mysterious robots that descended from the ceiling.

**[00:00:09 - 00:00:16]** While the robots had the element of surprise, they quickly found themselves surrounded and overwhelmed by our companions.

**[00:00:17 - 00:00:30]** After the battle, the group tried once more to figure out where they were, but no one came closer to the truth until they remembered the flashing symbols on a broken screen controlling the door.

**[00:00:30 - 00:00:36]** It was at that moment when Hears and Nico hot-wired the door control while Dr. O.K.

**[00:00:36 - 00:00:38]** mimicked the flashing symbols.

**[00:00:39 - 00:00:41]** The combination was enough to hiss open the door.

**[00:00:42 - 00:00:43]** What's on the other side?

**[00:00:43 - 00:00:48]** Find out this time on We'll Say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** Can I tell a story?

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:42]** Sure.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:42]** Cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:44]** Why do you look at me when you say it?

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** I don't like where this is going to go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:45]** Oh, man.

**[00:01:46 - 00:01:49]** I feel like this has happened before where I've started and been like, can I say something?

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:50]** And then Kev's like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:50]** Every time.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:52]** It's always targeted.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:52]** And then I feel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:55]** He always looks directly at Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:59]** No matter who says it, though, whenever someone says, can I tell a story?

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:01]** You're like, I don't like where this is going.

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:01]** Oh.

**[00:02:02 - 00:02:03]** You brought it on yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:04 - 00:02:07]** But when John looks me in the eye as he's saying it, it just makes it that much worse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** It's because you hate stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:09]** I hate stories.

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:10]** You hate stories.

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:10]** I love to tell them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:10 - 00:02:11]** He doesn't like anecdotes.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:12]** You love to tell them.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:13]** Yeah, you have them.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** I don't want to be the other end of it.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:15]** Oh, okay.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** Well, it's going to happen.

**[00:02:16 - 00:02:18]** I want to hear the story.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** So Kev is like, hey.

**[00:02:20 - 00:02:22]** I'm going to pick you up.

**[00:02:22 - 00:02:22]** Okay.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:23]** And come to the session.

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** I was like, great, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:25]** Oh, this story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:25 - 00:02:28]** And then he bugs me when I get there.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:28]** He's like, where are you?

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:29]** Status?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:29]** What's going on?

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** It was all via text.

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:32]** And I was like, you're the worst Lyft driver ever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:33]** Wait, let's get some context.

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:35]** John wants to know when I'm going to arrive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:36]** Hold on, hold on, hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** No, no, John wants to know when I'm going to arrive.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:39]** Oh my God, you really do hate stories.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:42]** Look, I am the unreliable narrator in this story.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:46]** You can defend yourself and do... I can be my own unreliable narrator, okay?

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** So look...

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** This isn't Parliament.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:53]** If it were, though, you would be deemed a murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:56]** You would be deemed a murder bot.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:57]** Probably not, actually.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** Says the murder bot.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** The eyes have it.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:06]** As I'm walking out, I had already called him the worst rideshare driver ever.

**[00:03:06 - 00:03:10]** I didn't want to get us in any legal battles with any big rideshare companies, so I didn't say any names.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:15]** And then as I'm walking out, Nick calls me.

**[00:03:15 - 00:03:16]** I got my stuff.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** I'm stoked.

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:18]** It's the end of the day.

**[00:03:19 - 00:03:22]** And as I'm getting near the car... Because you're the worst rideshare passenger.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:24]** Nick, or Kev, was like...

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:27]** And just slams on the horn.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:29]** And it was so loud.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:33]** And I realized at that moment that that is what makes me irate instantly.

**[00:03:34 - 00:03:36]** It's when just like loud noises just in your ear.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** I get angry.

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:40]** It's like it's an immediate reaction.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** I apologize.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:41]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** You did apologize.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:45]** This is not to shame you.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:48]** This was to open the door for you all to share your reactions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:48 - 00:03:50]** But I learned that Nick was the one on the phone.

**[00:03:50 - 00:03:52]** I thought you were on the phone with your dad or something.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:55]** If I was Nick, I would have slammed on the horn harder.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** That would have startled me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:58]** I was driving.

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** I was telling John in confidence.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:02]** I was just like, gosh, damn it.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:06]** John, do you ever have that reaction that when you hear loud noises, it startles you?

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:11]** I have a bodily reflex to very loud noises.

**[00:04:11 - 00:04:12]** I was in a meeting today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:18]** You should install this on a mechanical level of any time there's a loud noise in the game, you have to roll a reflex save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** I really should, but...

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:32]** And just before we went on air, I asked John for Wake Me Up When September Ends, and he's just like, denied.

**[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]** And he plays The Rains Down in Africa.

**[00:04:34 - 00:04:35]** It's a better song, though.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** Shame on you, sir.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:36]** It is a better song.

**[00:04:36 - 00:04:37]** Shame on you.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:40]** It's a better song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** How sustained was the horn honking?

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** How long did it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:44]** It was like a good 1,001.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:46]** It was not impulsive.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:47]** It was like 1,001.


## Speaker_0

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:47]** It was like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** Actually, half a second.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:53]** He was at least 10 to 15 feet away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:53 - 00:04:54]** He was on the other side of the road.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:59]** I heard it from my car speakers.

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** It was loud.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:02]** Don't deny it.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:03]** Don't minimize it.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** You did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** I'm confused.

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:08]** Kevin, are you just honking at everyone, or did this happen at the same time?

**[00:05:08 - 00:05:10]** No, I stopped to pick him up.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:11]** What about Nick's story?

**[00:05:11 - 00:05:13]** Nick was on the phone with John while he was driving here.

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:15]** Oh, you're just a nuisance, I see.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:20]** So your question was, like, how do we react when something is, like, really loud in our head?

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:21]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:24]** Is there something for you that it happens and you're just instantly upset?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:25]** I was driving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:25 - 00:05:27]** Wait, no, Nick was going to tell his story about work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:27 - 00:05:28]** Okay, go ahead, Nick.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:28]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:30]** So I was at work.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:33]** And we're sitting, we're learning about different phone systems.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:35]** Intermedia's phenomenal phone system.

**[00:05:35 - 00:05:37]** Like, if we want to plug office products.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** No, we don't.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:40]** Which we don't, but I mean, if we did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:42]** They don't sponsor this podcast.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:42]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:45]** And if you do in the future, thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:56]** At any case, though, as they're doing this demonstration, the...

**[00:05:56 - 00:06:00]** The ringback tone is just all of a sudden extremely loud.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:01]** And here I am just relaxing.

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:04]** I'm in a very kind of learning meditative mindset.

**[00:06:05 - 00:06:08]** And I'm just kind of like jolted forward and just like...

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:11]** Damn it, John.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:18]** Stick your head in a pie and just plaster your face all over the internet in shame.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** Really specific.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:27]** Anyway, the whole office just starts laughing at my violent reaction.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:30]** So it wasn't a very fun moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:34]** It sounds like you were like, if you were like sleeping in class and then the teacher says something loud.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** But I wasn't asleep though.

**[00:06:36 - 00:06:37]** I was very engaged.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** I was asking good questions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:42]** I see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:45]** I mean... I wouldn't have laughed at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** I would have laughed with you.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:49]** None of us would have laughed at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:54]** I mean, that's a very difficult distinction to draw in that moment.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:56]** Did you not laugh?

**[00:06:56 - 00:06:57]** No.

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** Then I wouldn't be laughing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:00]** See?

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:03]** Kevin just coming out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:06]** And this is when our podcast really became friends.

**[00:07:07 - 00:07:10]** This is when we can look back and say this is the moment.

**[00:07:10 - 00:07:12]** This is a big deal.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** We became family.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** The united government here.

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:18]** When you're here, you're family.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:21]** That's our motto.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:22]** I think that's pretty original.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:23]** No one uses that.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** I've never heard that one before.

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** So you, dear listener, you are family.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:28]** Thank you.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** When you're here, you're family.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:54]** thanks thanks fam thanks fam yeah does anyone want to say what happened last time you are family we got we got into a room and yeah you're family and then like we um we found out uh well actually the very last time a bunch of jetsons robots i called and came down because they had like squiggly arms that came out and with guns and whatever


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:55]** Yeah, drew a gun.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** The tentacle robot.

**[00:07:57 - 00:08:00]** The tentacle on the bottom drew first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:05]** Actually, I got a little bit of a jingle for that catchphrase, for that motto.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:10]** When you're here, you are family.

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** Did you just write that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:12]** That's pretty good.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:15]** And that won't get us sued unlike the other thing we said.

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** Definitely not.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** So that's good.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:18]** I like that.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** We do need a jingle.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:19]** We do.

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:23]** I mean, basically, we just destroyed the robots in a really good way.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:24]** That's all I can remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:25]** Yeah, that fight was really easy.

**[00:08:25 - 00:08:26]** No offense, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** And then the doors opened up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** He's so mad.

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:32]** He's just got to revolt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:33]** I was talking to him about it.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt your story.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** No, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:37]** That was it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:38]** That was the end of the episode.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:38]** Yeah.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:38]** All right.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:49]** I was talking to John afterwards, and he was like, yeah, they're ranged attack enemies, and we cornered them, and we had flanking, and all that fun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:54]** You guys work well as a team, which is my big question for you, is how well will you continue to work as a team?

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:55]** Perfectly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:55 - 00:09:00]** He's going to try to drive a wedge between us.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:05]** He's going to go beyond the AP and invent reasons to make us not have cross purposes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:12]** He's going to come up with divisions and clues to make us seem like we're enemies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:14]** He's going to do the impossible and divide by zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:14 - 00:09:15]** He might do that.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:22]** Nico, there's a relic over here, but first you got to really piss off Rick or something and then


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:29]** No, he's going to be like, Nick, this is a hit contract out for your life.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Signed by Hears.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** Oh, my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:32]** Where did this come from?

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:34]** And it came from Rick's pocket?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:47]** I still feel like Dr. O.K.

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:53]** could be the best at killing people in a very way that we wouldn't know was him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:55]** It's drugs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:55 - 00:09:55]** That's true.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:58]** But in general, yeah, he hasn't taken the Hippocratic Oath.

**[00:09:58 - 00:10:00]** But I'm philosophically subscribed to killing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:03]** He hasn't taken the Hippocratic Oath, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:03]** You don't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** Is he a medical doctor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:07]** Oh, yeah, he is.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:07]** Researcher.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:13]** But here, look, you guys did a good job of, well, one, you got lucky with some good rolls.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:13]** It was good.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** But then you also had good strategy.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Those rolls were tasty.

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:21]** It took a lot of book one, I think, for you guys to really start to cement together.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:26]** I mean, we can go back to some of our earliest fights where Dr. OK just walked out the room.


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:29]** I'll never forget that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:29 - 00:10:31]** Kelly was actually mad for that.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:32]** He really was.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:35]** I've never seen that before, but he was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:42]** And then in the unpublished version of episode four or five or whatever, he was like, just going to take a whole turn to drink whiskey.

**[00:10:42 - 00:10:45]** How long will it take to do this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:46]** Yeah.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** The same fight.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:50]** Ask us about that in a few weeks at Gen Con.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:52]** Yeah.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:55]** Ask us about the unpublished episode five.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:57]** And if you're not there, you can just message us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:57 - 00:11:01]** I didn't mean to interrupt Kelly's recount.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** It was literally the entire episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** No, no, no, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** There were a lot of other things.

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** Yeah, after that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:06 - 00:11:09]** We found a computer that's got a, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** It's got a pinhole camera in it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:11]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:14]** And Rick punched out the glass and threw a grenade.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:15]** And did nothing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:17]** Into this, like, cavern.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:19]** Yeah, Rick threw a hand grenade.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:22]** Where'd you get a hand grenade?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:22 - 00:11:22]** I don't know.

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:26]** You did technically waste a grenade, so make sure you take that off on your hero level.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:26]** I did.

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** Yeah, we did verify.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:28]** Which, you're welcome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:34]** I'm sorry, but I realize I have a grenade in my... Oh, fuck you.

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:36]** Give me your grenade.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** So, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** Oh, it looks bad.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:41]** Oh, shit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:48]** Their listeners can't view it because they're not viewers, they're listeners.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:54]** But there's now a pink glow over the room, which we were supposed to have last week, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:56]** Yeah, you were supposed to have last week.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:57]** The room has not changed.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:03]** This was the intended thing, but Roll20 was just being awesome.

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:04]** Thanks, Roll20.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:07]** It was actually my fault, so it's cool.

**[00:12:07 - 00:12:07]** So thanks for 20.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:08]** So thank you.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** Here's the thing.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** You guys were here's the thing.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:11]** Here's the thing.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:15]** I'm never going to not think of here's what I need to actually.

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:19]** So you all are looking at the you're looking at the door.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:22]** And if I recall, and I do.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:31]** I believe Nico and Hears were trying to hack the panel.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:32]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:34]** was spoofing symbols.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:38]** Pretty sure you gave us the equivalent of a hot wire, but, I mean, we're splitting hairs here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:39 - 00:12:48]** Well, so it's unclear who got the door open, but the door starts to kind of, like, move, tries to open.

**[00:12:48 - 00:12:51]** Seems like there's something wrong with the mechanism that's trying to open it, right?

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:53]** There's sparks.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** Yeah, there are some sparks a little bit.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:57]** Opens, closes, opens, closes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** It's like that one episode of Star Trek.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:02]** It's like that one episode.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Just that one.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** Which Star Trek?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** The original.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:07]** Oh, okay.

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:09]** Just checking.

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:10]** And then the door.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** That's my favorite one.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** Dude, TNG is favorite, hands down.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:20]** Yes.

**[00:13:20 - 00:13:27]** If you disagree, okay, everyone here agrees, if you disagree, please tell us, and we'll tell you why you're wrong.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:41]** So the door shutters and open unevenly, kind of finally, one before the other, at different times, and whatever mechanism struggling to open them, but finally, it opens.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:45]** And before you is a short...

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:56]** 10-foot hallway made of the same metal panels as in the room that you're in now, but none of the diffuse violet pink light.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:59]** And it ends in another double door.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:05]** Rick19 is standing, looking outside, having thrown a grenade.

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:11]** And Nico, Dr. OK, and Hears are standing near the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** What's the move?

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:21]** So Rick is going to, before we do anything else, he wants to, he's through the grenade, but he's going to go back into that chamber and kind of inspect it.

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:31]** And what I really want to look for right now is like the seam of the escape pod, quote unquote, to the wall.

**[00:14:31 - 00:14:34]** I want to see if I see a seam, if I can analyze that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** Does that make sense?

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:39]** So where the escape pod connects in the bay that it's in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:39 - 00:14:43]** Yeah.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:43]** Okay.

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** What are you looking for?

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:51]** I want to see if there is a seam, first of all, and if there's any way to pry it apart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:51 - 00:14:56]** So you want to see if you can disconnect the pod from the bay?

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:56]** Okay.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:57]** Give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:04]** That's a 6 plus 5, I believe.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** Not good enough for anything.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:09]** 6 plus 6, that's 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:10]** 12.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** All right.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** 12?

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:16]** 12 has taken people places before, you know, in game.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:17]** 12 gets you somewhere sometimes.

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:19]** Kelly is taking out some plastic bags.

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** Looks like he brought some snacks for the fam.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:21]** It's good.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** It's a dozen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:24]** It's actually dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Yeah, so snacks.

**[00:15:25 - 00:15:26]** So it's a dozen.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:27]** Kelly Downey Jr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:29]** Some tasty dice goblin snacks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:30]** Some tasty dice goblin snacks.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** No, no, no.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:47]** So, look, you go up, and if I'm understanding your question right, your android fingers go up and run along, and it seems like there is no seam, which is to say that these pods look like they are designed to come into this bay here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:56]** And so it seems like it's... Like there's no seam whatsoever, like it's a permanent part of the bay, or it seems like it's just a really good seam as if it's meant to fit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:56 - 00:15:56]** It's meant to fit.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:57]** Okay.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** It's a tight tolerance.


## Speaker_0

**[00:15:58 - 00:15:58]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:03]** And there's no way to pull it apart or retract it back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:04]** Not with a 12.

**[00:16:04 - 00:16:05]** I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:06]** Yeah.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:08]** You can't tell with a 12.

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:11]** I mean, you're looking at a big escape pod that you got out of.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:16]** Not that big, but pretty, you know, certainly Android sized.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:18]** I'm so sorry, but do we do phrasing at all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:20]** For what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** Got a really tight tolerance here.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:26]** You're just coming out of an escape pod.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** Sorry.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:31]** As a mechanical engineer, tight tolerance is a regular term.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:31 - 00:16:39]** I know it's a regular term for mechanical engineers, but if you excuse the uninitiated, it just sounds.

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:43]** What is the function of this song in the context of this game?

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:43]** To stop.

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:44]** Just to scare Nick.

**[00:16:44 - 00:16:45]** Loud noises.

**[00:16:45 - 00:16:46]** Well, that's not a loud noise.

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:50]** It's just kind of like, okay, why?

**[00:16:50 - 00:16:51]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:53]** Oh, because you're raining on Nick's parade.

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:56]** It's like the rains in Africa.

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** Okay, first punishment.

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:58]** Punishment.

**[00:16:58 - 00:17:00]** That was good.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Oh, thank God.

**[00:17:01 - 00:17:02]** My first punishment.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:04]** I'm so glad we're continuing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** Good, so wait.

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:06]** Did we?

**[00:17:06 - 00:17:08]** I don't know if we agreed on this, but I think I used mine.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:09]** Yeah.

**[00:17:09 - 00:17:11]** Did you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:13]** I don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:21]** But I tried to bring up the fact that a plus one to anything is kind of useless in Starfinder, especially at high levels.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:25]** But it does take you from a dozen to a baker's dozen.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:25]** I'm going to write this down.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:29]** That 13 would have done so much for you right now.

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:31]** That 13 really would have unlocked a lot.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** I think it just should be advantage.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:41]** From a GM perspective, for all you GMs out there or people who want to be GMs, I do do the rule of close success.

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:50]** So if the DC were actually 13, then I would have given Kev partially successful because he was so close, which I think is a good narrative tool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:50 - 00:17:51]** Anyway, let's talk about that.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:56]** So maybe instead of just a plus one, maybe it should be like a plus D. GM insight.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** Do, do, do, do, do.

**[00:17:57 - 00:17:59]** Plus like a D something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:02]** Are we changing this like midstream now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Yes, I'm off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** D6 is too far.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** I think D4.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:06]** D4?

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:07]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:07 - 00:18:08]** D4 is a lot though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** D4 for damage?

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:13]** D4 for damage, for skill check, for...

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:13]** Powerful.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** Four on a skill check.

**[00:18:15 - 00:18:17]** Or just a re-roll.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:18]** It's not that powerful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** It's a re-roll for a skill check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:24]** I tried to say re-roll and you told me no because quote unquote.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:25]** I think it should just be advantage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:25 - 00:18:26]** We should just do it.

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:27]** I think it should just be advantage.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:28]** Outside of that realm.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:30]** Like you just roll twice, you take another roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:31]** Yeah, we're not supposed to say that word.

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:32]** That's fine.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:33]** I'm fine with it.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:35]** All right, so let it be known.

**[00:18:35 - 00:18:36]** Then now, punishment.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:36]** Wait, are we voting on it?

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:37]** We voting?

**[00:18:37 - 00:18:38]** What are we voting on?

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:39]** What's on the table?

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** Changing punishment.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:41]** This is a democracy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:43]** Parliament's been convened again.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:44]** Let democracy rule.

**[00:18:44 - 00:18:46]** Do you want to be elected a murder bot again?

**[00:18:47 - 00:18:50]** First order of business, we reaffirm that Rick is a murder bot.

**[00:18:50 - 00:18:51]** We are.

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** Objection.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** Objection.

**[00:18:55 - 00:18:55]** Objection.

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** Second order of business.

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:57]** Hold on, hold on.

**[00:18:57 - 00:19:01]** The unanimous voting of whether or not

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:04]** Advantage will be given on punishments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:05 - 00:19:07]** It's not advantage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:09]** It's just a re-roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:12]** Correction to the language.

**[00:19:12 - 00:19:14]** Let's observe Robert's rules of order.

**[00:19:14 - 00:19:16]** Strike advantage from records.

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:21]** Strike advantage from records on all punishments.

**[00:19:21 - 00:19:25]** The vote is on punishments.

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:26]** It's a re-roll.

**[00:19:26 - 00:19:27]** I'll say aye.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:27]** Aye.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:28]** Aye.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:28]** Aye.

**[00:19:29 - 00:19:29]** Great.

**[00:19:30 - 00:19:30]** The ayes have it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:32]** Kelly now has punishment.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:33]** I do.

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:34]** Which is a re-roll.

**[00:19:34 - 00:19:35]** Which is a re-roll.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** That's fine.

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:36]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:37 - 00:19:38]** That you can do after the fact, right?

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** After your first roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:41]** No, you just decide.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:43]** Or you have to declare it ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:44]** Yeah.

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:52]** You go, you look at the scene, you can't see too much of what is going on in terms of like, can you move the pod or anything?

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:54]** I feel like I'm not quite getting your question right.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** No, I think you're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:56]** Okay, cool.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** I'm done with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:02]** It's machined together to be perfect.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:06]** Hey, Rick, do you want to join the rest of the party over here?

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** We just opened this door.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:10]** We're just looking at you.

**[00:20:10 - 00:20:15]** I know it's a trap, but we should probably try to get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** You seem to be making more of an advancement than I am.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** So yes, I will come your way.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:23]** And he puts away his axe and pulls out his artillery laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:26]** Yes, seems like a good idea to bring that out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:26 - 00:20:29]** And he's going to position himself to have the best view possible.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:30]** Which way is this?

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:31]** Oh, the door's just straight ahead, right?

**[00:20:31 - 00:20:32]** Yeah.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:32]** So where do you walk?

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** I'm going to walk forward towards the group.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:36]** Okay.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:36]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:37]** What's the move, y'all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:48]** Nico with kind of a clenched jaw is going to... I'm assuming that Nico was kind of on his knees when he was trying to fix the panel.

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:49]** Trying to hack it.

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:50]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:53]** So Nico's going to stand up.

**[00:20:53 - 00:21:00]** His eyes are going to be kind of wide and bulging with fear and concentration, but also anger still at the situation.

**[00:21:00 - 00:21:02]** His anger still hasn't subsided.

**[00:21:02 - 00:21:06]** And he's going to immediately reach for his pistol.

**[00:21:07 - 00:21:10]** And he's just going to be pointing it down and through the doorway.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:14]** And he's going to take a step into the hallway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:17]** So here's and Nico, it's a 10-foot hallway.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** Here's and Nico are almost...

**[00:21:19 - 00:21:19]** Abreast.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:22]** Yeah, I'll be breast to breast.

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:24]** I'll pull up the rear.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** Phrasing.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:30]** The light in this hallway, it's pretty stark.

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:37]** It's almost like you walk over a threshold and the room that you were in is all diffuse.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:40]** But the room that you're in now is just...

**[00:21:40 - 00:22:04]** feels dark the panels look unblemished but occasionally you still feel the vibration that you felt in the previous room as if whatever space this is in there's something happening and there's a door a double door in front of you so what do you all want to do um well i'm gonna nico's nico here's is gonna check out the door

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:06]** You walk over to the door.

**[00:22:06 - 00:22:10]** It looks pretty similar to the door that you were just in.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** My skin's curling again.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:11]** I don't like this.

**[00:22:12 - 00:22:26]** But the door doesn't have, whereas the previous door that you were in, the main thing that you guys were focused on was that display with this sputtering, glitching symbols that you all realized you could use a five-fingered hand to use.

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** This doesn't have that.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:31]** It's just the seam is another tight tolerance feature.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:34]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** We got a little perception on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:41]** Here, as you walk up to the door, and once again, but this time it's a little easier.

**[00:22:41 - 00:22:49]** Whatever mechanism in a previous door, this one sputters just a little bit, and then the doors open at the same time.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:50]** Okay.

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:53]** And when they open, I'm going to read this to you.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** Everybody close your eyes.

**[00:22:55 - 00:22:57]** And then I'll reveal it.

**[00:22:58 - 00:23:18]** The door opens into an octagonal chamber made of the same dull metal plates, several flickering purple lights the same as in the previous room, and five small inverted pyramids three to four inches across are set into the ceiling.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:28]** The grates comprising the floor have been secured with heavy octagonal bolts, and each of the eight walls...

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:49]** has a single alcove that holds a three foot diameter fan protected by a series of bars double airlock doors are set in the east and west walls the east wall of which you just opened and each has a control panel near it and i'm going to open


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** It looks like a trap.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:54]** Yes.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:58]** I think we investigate for traps.

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** What do you guys want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:03]** So you want to roll a perception check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:05]** Yep.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** I wish to look.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:07]** Okay.

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:09]** Is there any lighting effects on this?

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:12]** Like dim light or dark light?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:12 - 00:24:18]** It's dim in the sense that there are three purple lights at some vertices of the octagon.

**[00:24:18 - 00:24:24]** And they are just bright enough right near them that in the center is dim, but outside is bright.

**[00:24:25 - 00:24:27]** So mechanically, it's going to be normal light.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:30]** You're not going to have any sort of issue.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** But thank you for the description.

**[00:24:31 - 00:24:33]** That's a 25 for Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:33 - 00:24:35]** 25 for Nico.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** Perception?

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:37]** 18 for Hears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:37]** Perception.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** 18 for Hears.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:39]** I rolled a 24.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:40]** 24.

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:44]** Somebody give me... Before I get there.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:47]** You do realize that this room...

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:50]** the nozzles and the fans are connected.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:56]** And you can see here, you can see that there's a control panel on one side, control panel on the other.

**[00:24:57 - 00:24:58]** Nozzles?

**[00:24:58 - 00:24:59]** The nozzles and the fans are connected.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:59 - 00:25:01]** Sorry, can you point on the control panel for me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:04]** Yeah, let me tag you here on roll 20.

**[00:25:05 - 00:25:06]** Yep, yep, there.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** And then on the opposite wall.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:11]** Yep, but it's dark there because the light there is out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:13]** I do not wish to be guessed by anything here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:15]** On the adjacent wall to the right...

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:18]** Outside the door is one wall of the octagon.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:19]** That's where the first control panel is.

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:23]** And directly opposite of that is the other control panel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:25]** So you said these were pipes, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:27 - 00:25:36]** So in each wall, in the three walls on the north and three walls on the south, set behind a bunch of bars are three foot diameter pipes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:55]** fan this is how john gets us because he hasn't been able to kill us in battle so basically now we're going to an indiana jones style tomb right we're gonna step in the door's gonna close he's gonna gas us yeah what's the material of the bars made of


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:58]** Material of the bars is metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:01]** Okay, so I have a dueling sword.

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:09]** And one of the special properties of a dueling sword is that it actually requires a special type of sheath because it disintegrates anything it comes into contact with.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:11]** Is that in the Starfinder thing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:13]** It's actually in the description of the sword itself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** That's awesome.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:19]** Unfortunately, rules lawyer Kevin is looking it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:19 - 00:26:26]** I ruled pretty well, and I just looked up what my perception is, and I got a 29 on my roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:27]** That's impressive.

**[00:26:27 - 00:26:28]** That's really impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:36]** Can I detect any sort of nefarious mechanisms that just sniff the wrong way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** I'll tell you this.

**[00:26:39 - 00:26:48]** The nozzles at the top, the triangles, are nozzles for what you can deduce are probably some sort of jet that sprays out.

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:50]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** It's just a freezer.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** It's a cryogenic freezer.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** I know this from experience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:26:56 - 00:26:58]** Does somebody want to give me an engineering check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** I can do that.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** I can definitely do that.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:05]** Wait, who here is most skilled at engineering?

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:06]** I got a plus nine.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** I have a plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:08]** I have a plus three now, though.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:09]** I got a plus nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:09 - 00:27:10]** So I will assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** I will assist, Nico.

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:15]** I have 17 plus eight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:15 - 00:27:16]** I do not assist.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** 17 plus eight, 25.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:18]** Wow.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:19]** I do assist.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:20]** You assist?

**[00:27:21 - 00:27:22]** 25 assists me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** So that's 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** But I do just want to clarify that Nick was right.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:27]** It disintegrates.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:27]** That's fine.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:31]** His dueling swords, it uses a field of disrupted molecules.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:33]** Rules lawyer vindicated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:35]** You know, I am here for this, Nick.

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:39]** That quotes what he wants to do, and the rulebook supports it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:39]** Yeah.

**[00:27:39 - 00:27:44]** So I would like to try to see if I can cut through the metal bars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:44]** Okay.

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** So do you step into the room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:46]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:47]** Okay.

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:50]** So Nico pushes past.

**[00:27:50 - 00:27:51]** Right now it's Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:54]** And Nico's going to put away his pistol and draw a sword.

**[00:27:54 - 00:27:56]** Be aware of these nozzles.

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:00]** I'm a little weirded out by it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:01]** So Nico walks in the door.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:12]** Nothing seems to happen as you step in as your, I can imagine that your footsteps and then like hit the tooth and then you hear the sound kind of reverberate a little bit.

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:13]** Cause it's just all metal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:21]** Nico's going to do a stealth check at that point, and he's going to see if he can just kind of approach with caution.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:23]** He is paranoid right now, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:24]** Approaching where?

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** You're already in the room.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** He's approaching those bars with his disrupting sword.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** Can I look for any cameras?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:34]** And he's going to motion to Hears, by the way, to draw his sword and see if he can go cut the ones on the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** What do you say?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:41]** Yeah, Nico's going to look over to Hears, and he's going to be like, Hears, you thinking what I'm... Sorry.

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:43]** Hears, you thinking what I'm thinking?

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:44]** I'm not actually.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** I'm not a mind reader.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:49]** What are you thinking?

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** Says the telepath.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:55]** So we used to manufacture these dueling stories at Orion Industries.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:59]** These things have disruptor fields around them and can cut through just about anything.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:01]** That's why they have specialized sheaths for them.

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:07]** Let's cut through the metal bars and see if we can't get through the fans and defang whatever this trap is in here.

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:10]** I think it's kind of dangerous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** I think that's premature, Nico.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** Why don't we check out the computer first?

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** And then we'll try.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:23]** Maybe we can find out what type of system this is.

**[00:29:23 - 00:29:25]** Don't you enjoy hacking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** That is kind of your thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:28]** If you help me hack this, we could figure out.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:36]** I'm going to stay in this little intermediate chamber for the meantime in case something bad happens to you guys.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:38]** I'm there to maybe help.

**[00:29:39 - 00:29:39]** Sound like a plan?

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:43]** Just make sure you don't ink up the place too much.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:45]** Or maybe I'll be locked out.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** That would be terrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:46 - 00:30:09]** so nico you brush past and you guys are talking and i can imagine that that as you all were talking nico was like all right i'm just gonna go in and as you walk in dr okay you don't notice no nothing happens as nico walks in by the way that's a 29 on the stealth role too does that help protect your steps don't reverberate as much as i said that's that's how yourself helps

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:12]** Correction to you, good game master, sir.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** So, Dr.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:16]** O.K., you don't see any cameras.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:17]** Here's.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:19]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:21]** and here's are standing right at the lip of the room.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** And here's.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:26]** I don't know if there's something in your past that, like, makes you think about.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** It's just all fits.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:31]** You're like, oh, I get it.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:39]** This seems like with the way the fans are separated, the way the blades are curved and everything, you're like, you know what?

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:44]** This is some sort of decontamination chamber.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:50]** It triggers when both doors shut.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** Rick pushes the shut button.


## Speaker_0

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:53]** Rick's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:56]** Very impulsive, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:56 - 00:31:00]** Just to see if the decontamination is a human.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:02]** I just know that's aimed at me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:06]** Like, no explanation required.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:06]** I'm kidding.

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:08]** Kevin would have pushed the button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:31:09 - 00:31:14]** If the five of us were in a room, Kevin would push the button just to desanitize me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:14 - 00:31:16]** By the way, if anyone ever laughs at you, I won't.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:18]** Bye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:29]** That song will never be worn out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:32]** It's one of those songs that you can listen to forever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:34]** Here's the thing.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:41]** You realize that this is not just like, oh, it's going to just turn on and then it's like, oh, it's a nice mist and you walk in.

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** It's not like that at all.

**[00:31:43 - 00:31:46]** It seems very intense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:48]** Okay.

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:52]** But its purpose is to decontaminate

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:55]** I guess non-organic beans or something?

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:55]** Is that why it's so intense?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:31:56 - 00:32:06]** The purpose is to decontaminate, but what happens is that you can tell by the size of the nozzles, the size of the fans, this is an intense process.

**[00:32:06 - 00:32:08]** This is like walking through a car wash.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:12]** It will be mechanically harmful to you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:15]** Rick, do you say that out loud?

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:18]** Here's Will say that out loud.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:24]** He's like, these nozzles, I have a lot of experience with machinery and stuff.

**[00:32:24 - 00:32:29]** Maybe you know this too, Nico, but they're way too powerful.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:36]** And I think that's a decontamination chamber, but it's going to hurt real bad if it triggers, for sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:36 - 00:33:02]** uh i really think i we gotta hack this and turn it off all right let's let's go disable it somehow i'm willing to run it i i believe that my my exterior might be a little tougher than the rest of you does here's know if that is true if does nico know if that's true if because he's rolled a 25 or something does he can he tell if like rick will be okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:07]** That was really long.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:12]** You would be subject to the same.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:16]** Just disregard everything I said then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:17]** No, I mean, you said it.

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:19]** These seem like pretty heavy.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** These are pretty heavy jets.

**[00:33:21 - 00:33:24]** There's a lot of pressure that's going to come out of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:24]** Okay.

**[00:33:24 - 00:33:27]** Maybe we could go up with some.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** If you die, Cap, I won't laugh.

**[00:33:28 - 00:33:29]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:38]** Another thing with the idea of a decontamination room, though, is we can't get that other door open without shutting this door.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** So it's going to have to shut both doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:42]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:42 - 00:33:43]** Yeah, we should try to hack it.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:43]** That's a good idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:47]** So, yeah, here's...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:47 - 00:34:13]** goes over to try to hack it and um here's walks over to the panel tells he already told nico and i'll assist okay i have a plus 10 rick will actually stay in the doorway and make sure it doesn't close okay so rick is gonna stay in the doorway nico crosses and walks across the room to the other door here's and dr okay are standing next to the panel on the right here's give me an engineering panel all right i thought it was a computer

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** All right, cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:14]** I'm on the panel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:15]** Is it computers or engineering, or can I do both?

**[00:34:15 - 00:34:16]** It's an engineering check.

**[00:34:16 - 00:34:17]** Okay, I got it.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:17]** All right.

**[00:34:17 - 00:34:18]** Engineering check.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:19]** Let's do it.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:20]** Jeez.

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:22]** It's an 8 plus 8.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:22]** It's a 16.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:24]** Just a 16 this time.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** It's a 16?

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:25]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:26]** Who is assisting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:28]** Doctor, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:31]** I assist.

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:32]** Okay.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** Nico, were you assisting?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:37]** No, I'm doing the other panel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:37 - 00:34:38]** Nico's going to the other panel.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:40]** Are they interconnected?

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:43]** Because then he could be considered assisting if he's working on the other...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:46]** Are you going to roll an engineering check on the other panel?

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** Okay.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** What do you roll?

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:48]** 10.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** 10.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:53]** Okay.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:56]** So... It's a skill check.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:58]** It's a skill check.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** It's not a critical fail.

**[00:34:59 - 00:34:59]** It's a skill check.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** Yeah.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** Oh, you rolled a 1.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** Oh, my God.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:02]** Plus 9.

**[00:35:06 - 00:35:10]** Kevin's over here just looking over my shoulder like, you're going to call it that one there?

**[00:35:10 - 00:35:11]** You're going to call it that one?

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:13]** I'm looking over like, dude, it's a skill check.

**[00:35:13 - 00:35:14]** I didn't see what you rolled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** I was like, 10 is low.

**[00:35:16 - 00:35:18]** Did you add your bonuses?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:24]** So you walk up to the door, you're going through the control panel.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:37]** You don't have to hack it as manually as you did before, but you do have to kind of set some settings on it and then pry it open and look at some of the wires, some of the connection, the ports to it.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:48]** And Nico, you figure out that you can put the other panel into some sort of safety mode, something that allows it to kind of just be a neutral space.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:52]** So really it's just here's and Dr. OK going through on this panel.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:57]** And when you do, you're going through, you clip one wire and you hear...

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:06]** and you're confident that you got it, that if you were to come in, the door would not close.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:12]** You can open the other door without the nozzles going off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Well done.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:14]** Well done.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:17]** Wow, that went better than I expected.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:19]** It's way too easy.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:21]** What did you roll that made you feel so confident about it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:22]** Oh, in engineering?

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:25]** Because I'm that much of a boss with this that I clipped the right wire.

**[00:36:25 - 00:36:26]** I know I did.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:26]** Okay.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** It didn't take that long.

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** It took only about one minute.

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:30]** It's always the red wire.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** It's always red wire.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:32]** It's suspicious, though.

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:34]** It's always red wire.

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:34]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:41]** There's also a level of suspicion because just from a metagame perspective, book one was one thing.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:44]** And now book two for you guys has turned out to be something else.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:47]** So you guys are like on a different level.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** Nico's just going to say it loud.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** He's going to be like,

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** I don't like any of this.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:55]** I think I shut it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:55 - 00:37:01]** I think we should try and find a plan B. But... Hey, Captain Tentacles over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:04]** Of course we need to find a plan B.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:12]** Can we destroy one of these fans and jam it somehow?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:12]** Please.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:17]** Finally, the Ashara over here makes a logical point.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:18]** Let's do this.

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:22]** I got a dueling sword over here with a disruptor field.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** Let's just do this.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:26]** I've been itching to just hack something all day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:30]** He has that sword, but I don't know if he's going to join in yet.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:32]** He's trying to keep a cool head.

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:35]** Can he open up the doors on the other end from this machine?

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:39]** If you want.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:39]** Damn it.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** That's not a good phrase to hear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:44]** All right, so I shut it off.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:45]** Are you guys ready?

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:46]** I'm going to open the doors.

**[00:37:47 - 00:37:48]** On the other side.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:52]** I will try to hold this door open so that you guys aren't trapped in case it goes wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:53 - 00:37:53]** All right.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:56]** Try it here, but be warned.

**[00:37:56 - 00:37:59]** If this doesn't work, I'm hacking that fan.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:01]** Oh, you can hack the fan first.

**[00:38:01 - 00:38:02]** Go for it.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:04]** Go, go, go.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:04]** Do it.

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:08]** Nico's going to look around like, you guys are actually going to let me do this?

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:08]** Yeah, screw it.

**[00:38:09 - 00:38:10]** All right, so Nico's going to go over there.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:12]** He's actually going to go hack the fan with the dueling sword.

**[00:38:12 - 00:38:16]** And he's going to be like, you stupid piece of junk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:18]** We're doing like a Kylo Ren?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** Yeah.

**[00:38:21 - 00:38:23]** And then he's going to look back at everybody else.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** Anything else?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** You cut through the bars.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:31]** Sorry, I'm supposed to not laugh at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:33]** You were laughing with you.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:36]** Yeah.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:37]** Great try.

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:39]** Should I play it?

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** I'm not going to play it.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:43]** Nico, you cut through the bars.

**[00:38:43 - 00:38:45]** Takes not long.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:49]** Bars fall.

**[00:38:49 - 00:38:51]** The fan is just sitting there in front of you.

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** You slice through it.

**[00:38:52 - 00:38:54]** It falls.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** The blades of the fan fall.

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:56]** Nothing happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:04]** Nico's going to be like, that was anticlimactic and yet so, so satisfied.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:05]** Do you see anything down there?

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:08]** The cavity, what it revealed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:08 - 00:39:15]** When you step into the cavity past the sliced bars, I feel like you just get it.

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:19]** It feels like suddenly you're in the escape pod again because it's a pretty tight cavity.

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:26]** As you are talking, the fan, it just seems like right beyond it is just the wall.

**[00:39:27 - 00:39:28]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:29]** All right.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** You want to chop up the other fan?

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:31]** There's only one more, right?

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:32]** There's six.

**[00:39:32 - 00:39:33]** Oh, fuck it.

**[00:39:33 - 00:39:34]** Let's just open the door.

**[00:39:35 - 00:39:37]** Here's opens the door.


## Speaker_0

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** So here's opens the door.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:48]** I can picture Nico still in the fan space.

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:56]** When that happens and you hear... The door opens very slowly.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:57]** It doesn't even, like, try to open.

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:11]** It's just... And, again, I'm going to read it, and then I will reveal it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** R&R.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Read and reveal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Read and reveal.

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** I need some of that R&R.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** That's for sure.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:27]** As soon as the door opens, as soon as the crack comes through, you see a blue light just come down.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:35]** It's almost like when you're in those, you know, cairns in the UK that are lined up with the solstice, and then, like, the solstice comes out in a single source of light.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:41]** It's like that just hits the floor and just slowly starts to spread out across this chamber, and it's a blue light.

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** And from the way you can see it—nice—

**[00:40:44 - 00:41:02]** from the way you can see it it seems like it's from some sort of computer screen as there's a room that's probably at least 60 feet deep it's like a long probably like 30 feet wide 60 feet deep i am the architect

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:30]** But you can see that the space, sometimes for a split second, that blue light, you see a shadow move across the floor of this decontamination chamber because you realize that there are wires and tubes and bits of complex machinery hanging from broken panels in the ceiling, swaying in falling dust and streams of thin vapor that seem to be issuing from some of the open pipes that are in the ceiling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:33]** Ergo, vis-a-vis, concordantly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:45]** You can see that there are a couple other stations and some other screens that are flickering.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:52]** And that they're along the walls.

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** There are more screens.

**[00:41:56 - 00:42:09]** Their chairs overturned, computer terminals occupied much of the room's center, and those sparks of electricity issue from deep cracks in the ceiling and from those computer terminals.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:18]** The first realization that each of you has is that this is the first area of true technology that you've seen.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:20]** What's your move?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:26]** True technology that you see, meaning like everything else, all the other technology we interact with is fake.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:26]** It's a simulation.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** It's a game.

**[00:42:27 - 00:42:30]** This is like we're finally getting to the exterior of the game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:36]** No, it's just that before you were looking at little iPads in the wall.

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:39]** And now this is like a nexus point.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:41]** Like there are computer terminals.

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:43]** There are chairs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:46]** The door where Rick is standing didn't flicker at all.

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:48]** No.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:54]** So he'll wait until somebody else crosses the next threshold, and then he'll step into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:54 - 00:42:56]** Nico's going to go in.

**[00:42:56 - 00:43:09]** He's going to be in awe of the technology in there, and he frankly wants to see what he can salvage in here and see if he can't create a little bit bigger of a transceiver in his data pad so he can ping a signal out for help anywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:14]** Yeah, here's just going to go in and walk towards that screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:16]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:20]** will move to the threshold antechamber, I guess.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:29]** I'm holding back until... I don't want to leave this door open or let this door shut with anybody in that room.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:34]** So I'm waiting until somebody else basically holds the door open for me, and then I'll pass through the room.

**[00:43:36 - 00:43:37]** Rick just doesn't trust the room itself.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:40]** The decontamination room.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:41]** Okay.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** Can we jam it?

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:45]** Rick is ready to jam the current door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:51]** That door is pretty hard to open, and it was kind of sporadic in the way it opened.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:53]** I think we'd have a difficult time closing it again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:54]** Okay, well, I'm just letting you know.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:57]** I'll wait until you guys are out of that room, and then I'll pass.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:57 - 00:43:57]** Okay, Chuckles.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:03]** Okay.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:06]** Good.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:08]** Okay.

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:11]** So... Damn it.

**[00:44:11 - 00:44:12]** I made a slight mistake.

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:19]** As you open the door, you see another tonka chamber.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:19 - 00:44:21]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:24]** And beyond that is a... And then as you beyond that is that room.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** This is just a really big mistake.

**[00:44:26 - 00:44:28]** The doors are just glitching open.

**[00:44:28 - 00:44:29]** The doors are glitching open.

**[00:44:29 - 00:44:31]** Oh, my God.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:31]** That's fine.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:32]** Wow.

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:32]** So...

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:37]** So there's this little vestibule.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:39]** So unsympathetic.

**[00:44:40 - 00:44:42]** Check for traps in this vestibule.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:42]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:42]** Of course.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:43]** Hello there.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:44]** Hello.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:47]** Perception 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:50]** You don't think there are any traps?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:52]** Mika's going to go in anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:52 - 00:44:53]** Yeah, that's fine.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:54]** Let's go.

**[00:44:56 - 00:44:56]** Totally fine.

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** So you guys go in.

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Here's the thing.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:01]** The second thing you realize.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:02]** Oh, okay.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:02]** Yeah.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:09]** There's only two... Yeah, this room overall looks wrecked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:12]** What are those dancing lights?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:14]** The dancing lights are sparks of electricity.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:16]** Some are blue, some are purple.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:18]** There seems to be a purple light.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:20]** Nico walks in the room.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:25]** Because the second thing that you notice... I'm glad you don't care.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:27]** Nico, as you walk in, you're like...

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:32]** The air is very irritating.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:33]** But you just push through.

**[00:45:33 - 00:45:35]** Onions and ketchup.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:42]** And as you push through... So the thing is that here's... You're like...

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:44]** It's weird.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:45]** Yeah.

**[00:45:45 - 00:45:46]** The air tastes kind of weird.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:51]** Nico, as soon as you walk in, you're like, oh, what's going on in this room?

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:53]** This wrecked room.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:57]** I mean, it's very dark except for a screen that's like 40 feet away and a flickering purple light.

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:02]** And as you walk in, you're like, oh, my God.

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:06]** And you feel your lungs start to burn and everyone needs to roll for initiative.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:06]** Shh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** I was just doing a perception roll.

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** Okay, but I guess now we're one for initiative.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:12]** You walked into a room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:14]** You walked in, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:14 - 00:46:15]** Oh, man.

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:15]** Rick is last.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:15 - 00:46:19]** That would have been me if you hadn't made that map mistake earlier.

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:24]** And I realized after I said that I should probably actually perceive things before moving in.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** It's all good.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:26]** All right.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:27]** So it's a good lesson.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:30]** Nico is, is in the room.

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:31]** Here's the standard threshold.

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:35]** Dr. K is standing at the threshold of the vestibule in the decontamination room.

**[00:46:36 - 00:46:39]** And Rick is standing next to Dr. Okay.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** Rick is raising his hand.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:43]** I was just holding up five because that's what I got for my initiative.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:43]** Okay.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:44]** You got a five.

**[00:46:44 - 00:46:45]** Rick got a five.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:46]** Is there anybody?

**[00:46:46 - 00:46:47]** Let's start at the top here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:50]** 19 on the die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:50]** 19.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Is there anybody?

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:51]** 20.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** I got a 19.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:54]** Okay.

**[00:46:54 - 00:46:55]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:55]** 20.

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:57]** Nico, 19.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** Here's what you get.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:58]** 13.

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:59]** 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:59 - 00:47:11]** Hey, just letting you guys know, as a constructed being, I get a plus two to saves against anything that creates disease, mind effects, poison, or sleep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:14]** Hey, robot, get over there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:19]** Well, I'm just saying, if you're going to walk into a room full of gas, you should probably be the robot that does it.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:19]** Yeah.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:21]** Well, I mean, sorry, the android.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** Yeah.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:23]** The murder bot.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:24]** It's fine, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:41]** So as you walk in, you feel like this, this sense of your lungs burning and you feel your skin, whatever sense of like whatever showing from your armor.

**[00:47:41 - 00:47:43]** It feels like it's starting to like touch on your skin.

**[00:47:43 - 00:47:46]** Your skin feels like it's hurting, Nico.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:47]** But we're going to go in order here.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** It's going to be Dr. OK.

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:49]** What are you doing?

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** You probably hear this on the comms.

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:54]** I don't know what you're saying, Nico, as you walk in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:57 - 00:48:02]** Did you want me to continue why you were?

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:05]** Just keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:08]** What's going on there, Nico?

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:09]** Yeah, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:11 - 00:48:13]** It sounds as if he has inhaled something.

**[00:48:13 - 00:48:15]** Actually, it cut in the middle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:16 - 00:48:17]** Nico seems like he's in distress.

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:19]** Don't we have environmental suits?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:20]** You do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:24]** Can I do a life science check from here?

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:26]** From where you are?

**[00:48:27 - 00:48:32]** Yeah, I have my custom micro lab, so I can probably sample some sort of incoming air.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:41]** Yeah, because Nico is now like 10 feet in, and by this time, the air is starting to move into the chamber, the decontamination chamber.

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:45]** So you don't feel like you can't breathe, but you do taste it, Doctor.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** Shut the door.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:46]** That's sharp.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** That's a dick move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:49]** Give me a life science check.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:52]** Can I do a... Life science or medicine.

**[00:48:53 - 00:49:00]** Well, I'm going to... You get to actually activate them.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:00]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:03]** They do have like a... I'd have to open the book.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** Never mind.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:07]** I thought I could use polymath.

**[00:49:07 - 00:49:08]** Oh, you have to actually activate.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:08]** Yeah, I see.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** 48 uses.

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:11]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:16]** I will use... I'll do a life science check.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** Hang in there.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** Hang in there, buddy.

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:24]** Does a... What's happening?

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:26]** 32 get me anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:30]** Yeah, immediately as you taste it, you're like, oh, I know exactly which compound that is.

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:36]** Because you know that this is some sort of vapor that is caustic and is definitely dangerous.

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:46]** It's an acidic gas that is just being pumped in from some... You know, it's not meant to be in the room, but it's just being pumped in from something that's broken in the ceiling.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:47]** Okay.

**[00:49:48 - 00:49:49]** It's Dr. O'Keefe's turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:51]** Yes, I...

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:54]** I'm going to... Is this a drug or a poison?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:56]** It's an acidic gas.

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:59]** It's not really a poison mechanically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:59 - 00:49:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** Even though it operates as such.

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:06]** Is this... You're not poisoned, but you will take damage.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:07]** Possibly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:10]** A biochemical agent causing damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:11 - 00:50:12]** Yeah.

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** But a poison would cause adverse effects.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:15]** No.

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** It's not a poison per se.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** It's acid, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:21]** Yeah, it's like an acidic caustic gas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:21]** Hey, this is acid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:23]** Do we know where it's coming from?

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:25]** It's coming from the ceiling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:28]** If this is acid, why aren't I tripping?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:40]** If you want to give me an engineering check, Dr. K, you might be able to have some insight into where it's coming from or into how to deal with it.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:41]** Okay.

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:44]** But you're not in the room, so just FYI, I'm going to make the DC a little harder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:45]** Okay.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** And it would be an engineering check?

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** Yeah.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:52]** Well, because I could do that or move, right?

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** Yeah.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** So I'm just going to go for the check.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:58]** Ooh, not bad.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:59]** 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:59 - 00:50:59]** Yeah.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:02]** Can I assume this is a corrosive atmosphere?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:05]** The armor definitely protects.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:08]** Are you talking about environmental protections for your armor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** Yeah, you'll be fine.

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:12]** There's a mechanism for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** I just wanted to read some of it.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:20]** A typical corrosive atmosphere deals anywhere from 1 acid damage per minute up to 10d6 acid damage per round.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** Damn, son.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** To creatures and objects within it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:23]** Dr.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:26]** O.K., you're pretty sure that's from where you can see?

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:30]** The best bet is to get to that computer on the other side of the room.

**[00:51:31 - 00:51:33]** Because that seems to be the only working thing in here.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Get to the computer!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:38]** And then shoot her!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:40 - 00:52:04]** rick or uh nico it's your turn you're standing in there i'll tell you something as you're coughing weirdly you're like is this is this the the air that i'm breathing or am i just like am i seeing something weird all you realize maybe you couldn't tell from where you were standing 10 15 20 feet back but all of the computer consoles are two feet high what

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:07]** The ceilings are like 15 feet high in this room.

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:10]** But all the computer consoles are like two feet high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:12]** Like they're made for short creatures?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:12]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:13 - 00:52:14]** Like our shape-shifting friends.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:16]** Yeah, like little Astro Zones.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:17]** Those guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** So what do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:20]** It's your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:22]** What?

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** Nico's just going to say it loud.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:30]** What's happening here?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:33]** Why are these two computers?

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:37]** Why are they two feet high?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** That's what your concern is.

**[00:52:41 - 00:52:42]** As you breathe in.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** Because you said that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:49]** Okay, I'm out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:49]** And where do you go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:50 - 00:52:51]** He's just going to go back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:52]** He's going to walk back.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:56]** Give me a fortitude saving throw and give yourself a plus four.

**[00:52:57 - 00:52:57]** All right.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:00]** So can we use our environmental protection suits for this?

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:01]** I think so, from what I read.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** That's an 11.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:05]** It says it just covers toxic gas.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:06]** Did you already have a plus four?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:07]** Corrosive gas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:14]** So that is the plus four that he got because he's wearing... Because he has armor.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:17]** Unfortunately... It's not enough to save me.

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:21]** You take four points of acid damage because it just gets right in there.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:22]** And you were so close.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:25]** And you didn't make it.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:26]** All right.

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:27]** It is...

**[00:53:28 - 00:53:29]** Here's... What are you doing?

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:32]** I think I rolled the lowest initiative, though.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:32]** You rolled a 13?

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:34]** I rolled a 5.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** Oh, okay.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:39]** So, Nico comes running in, coughing, stumbling back in.

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:40]** What do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:40 - 00:53:45]** Right, so here's this... So, this suit will protect me 100%, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:47]** It will give you a bonus.

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:48]** Really?

**[00:53:48 - 00:53:49]** Yeah.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:49]** It's corrosive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:52]** I mean, think, like... It's a plus 4 bonus.

**[00:53:52 - 00:53:57]** Yeah, if you think about what an acidic agent does to any art, like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:59]** A bonus of what, sorry?

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** So that I can survive?

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:02]** Like, what am I adding my bonus to?

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:02]** Plus four.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** Plus four to what?

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** Let's not worry about that.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:05]** Okay.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** Tell me what you want to do.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** Well, I want to put on my damn suit.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Is it not on already?

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:11]** Well, I think you already have it on.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:12]** Yeah.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:14]** We all have skin.

**[00:54:14 - 00:54:15]** It says 48 uses, so I thought I had to wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:17]** Your armor has environmental protection, so that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:18]** Okay.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:19]** Shit.

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:22]** Well, I mean, I have high engineering and high computers.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:29]** So, I mean, here's first of all, there's this weird freaking thing like on the floor in front of me.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:31]** It looks like a weapon that the Covenant use in Halo.

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:32]** What is that thing?

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:33]** Looks like a needler.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:36]** It's just like a weird couple of memes.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** It's not anything interesting.

**[00:54:37 - 00:54:38]** All right.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:43]** So here's is going to put on a suit and then, well, you're already wearing it, but yeah, damn it.

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:44]** He's going to like go to the computer.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** He's going to like make a mad dash for it.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:50]** And, um, he has, um, so yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:52]** Are you going to move double your speed?

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:57]** Because you can't go in a straight line and run because there are all these computer consoles in front of you.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:57]** Right.

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:58]** Okay.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:03]** I have a thing where I can go, like, 40 feet because of my, like, fleet or whatever.

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:10]** So there would be 5, 10, no, 5, then 15 because it's a diagonal.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:13]** 20, 25, 30, 35, 40.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:13]** Damn it.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:15]** It's going to be hard to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:15 - 00:55:18]** Do you want a 10-foot bonus to your speed?

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** Yeah, I'd love that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:23]** Or do you want a plus two on skill check?

**[00:55:24 - 00:55:26]** If you give me the speed bonus, I think I can get there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** I think, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** I can do that next turn.

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** If you wait six seconds...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:36]** 35, 40.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:40]** You can make it to right in front of the panel.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** Can I use it then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:42]** Yeah.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Double move?

**[00:55:44 - 00:55:47]** Yeah, but he would use it on the next turn is what you're saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:50]** Well, no, you can move once and then move again as your standard action.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:51]** Right?

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:53]** Because what's your standard movement speed?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** But then you can't do anything else.

**[00:55:54 - 00:55:55]** You can't do anything else.

**[00:55:56 - 00:55:57]** But you can get right in front of the panel.

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:59]** And then your next turn you can start operating the computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** But it's just a regular move action for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:02]** You have 40 feet of movement?

**[00:56:02 - 00:56:04]** Oh, you have 40 feet of movement.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:05]** Yeah, because I have like a special ability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** Then you run in.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:08]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:11]** So here's like gets right in front of the computer and he's going to attempt to shut it down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:11 - 00:56:12]** Okay.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:13]** Give me.

**[00:56:13 - 00:56:19]** So as you run up, you notice that the light from this computer is illuminating this whole board, this whole console in front of you.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:24]** And there seems to be one like control panel, one section of it.

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:25]** That's like blinking.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:33]** Clearly it's indicating some sort of failure alarm that is saying that, you know, this gas is coming in and you're like, that's probably, I'm just going to take a guess.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** It's probably the one that I'm going to need.

**[00:56:34 - 00:56:41]** Give me an engineering check because that's the panel that you're going to want to try and like grab the computer and then like change it and


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:40 - 00:56:48]** I would use a... If you had the opportunity to try twice... Well, I did roll a 26.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:50]** Oh, never mind.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** You rolled a 26 in engineering.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** Okay.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:59]** As you do that... You're, like, smashing on it.

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:00]** You're, like, hackerman it.

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:03]** And this whole time... Yeah, I can picture you running.

**[00:57:04 - 00:57:07]** You're like... And because you succeeded...

**[00:57:08 - 00:57:18]** by five or more, just as you're like, and I would make you roll to take damage, you press something and you hear like, you just hit enter and it was good to go.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:20]** That's all you needed to do was hit enter.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:22]** It was a screensaver that was on.

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:25]** The screensaver was on, and you just had to log back in.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:25]** That was it.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:36]** So as you do that shh in the air, and you catch your breath, and you feel like that caustic, acidic air is gone.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** Are we out of initiative?

**[00:57:39 - 00:57:40]** You're out of initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** Is it my turn yet?

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:41]** Jeez.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:44]** Here's what you say as you do that.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** Like, what's the, like, next step?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:47]** I freaking got it!

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:51]** And then just, like, jumps for joy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** Dr. Okay starts to walk in.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:54]** But here's the thing.

**[00:57:54 - 00:58:00]** As you were so focused on trying to get to that panel, you were, like, running, running.

**[00:58:00 - 00:58:07]** Just the room is, like, barely... I definitely think it's dim light unless you're standing within the five feet that are right around the console panel.

**[00:58:07 - 00:58:10]** And so you can't see a lot of what's going on around you.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:10]** But there's rubble.

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:11]** There are beams.

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:12]** There are...

**[00:58:12 - 00:58:13]** You know, you hear all these things around you.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:16]** You're trying to catch your breath, not breathe acid.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** Can Rick get his turn?

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:18]** Well, we're out of initiative.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:20]** I think I should do something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** Some mob.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:23]** Because one, I don't, I see.

**[00:58:23 - 00:58:25]** You had six seconds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** You do.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:29]** He did have six seconds, like simultaneously.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:34]** You had, but, but I'm going to say that in that time that whatever you were going to do, you did make it.

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:35]** I was just going to roll perception.

**[00:58:36 - 00:58:36]** That's fine.

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:38]** Well, because here's the thing.

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:40]** I mean, I have dark vision too.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:41]** Here's his blind sense.

**[00:58:42 - 00:58:44]** Here's, you are standing there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:46]** You're like, yes, yes, I did it, I did it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:52]** And then you look to your left and you see something.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:55]** You just barely make it out in the light.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:57]** And then you look to your right and you see something.

**[00:58:58 - 00:59:02]** And then you kind of look behind you and you see something.

**[00:59:03 - 00:59:05]** And as you turn back around, you're like, wait a minute.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:23]** There are three small bodies slumped over onto the console on the squares right on each side of you.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:25]** And that's our game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:29]** Oh, no.

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:30]** Rick opens fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:32]** I've seen too many dead bodies.

**[00:59:32 - 00:59:33]** Are they, like, zombies or something?

**[00:59:33 - 00:59:35]** It's gonna be zombies.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:36]** Oh, I hate zombies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:36 - 00:59:38]** This acid was keeping them at bay.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:39]** Maybe.

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:48]** Oh, maybe, like, yeah, someone shut down the place and intentionally destroyed it to prevent them from getting out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:49]** Hey, guys.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:51]** Nico Ryan here.

**[00:59:51 - 00:59:56]** That felt good to take my anger out on those robots.

**[00:59:56 - 01:00:00]** What's it going to take to get a straight answer out of anything that I've seen?

**[01:00:00 - 01:00:10]** If this were my boardroom, someone would have been fired, blacklisted from ever being hired ever again anywhere, and I would have gone ballistic on somebody.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:15]** It's in times like this where I have to remind myself of what my mentors in Tuco always told me.

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:18]** Nothing matters but the truth.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:23]** If I could only take my ego out of things, maybe I'd be able to see clearly, but...

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** Here's to hoping.

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:29]** Until then, Nico Orion, signing off.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:55 - 01:00:57]** Thank you.
