**[00:00:00 - 00:00:10]** Previously on Will Save... Looks like Dr. Kantuokatis was able to KO the Bounder, but the crew are far from being okay.

**[00:00:11 - 00:00:28]** As the rooms show signs of being torn apart by a colossal floating terror, unable to phone home with the Grey's ET communications console, they press on to find another room torn apart, this time full of toys just in time for the holidays.

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:32]** But this room's not full of just sugar plums dancing through your head, Rick.

**[00:00:32 - 00:00:38]** Turns out that at least one of these toys isn't just looking for some playtime.

**[00:00:38 - 00:00:41]** Will this fiendish plush toy be a real killjoy?

**[00:00:41 - 00:00:46]** Or does true joy come from crushing this like a grape Fanta?

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:50]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:34 - 00:01:40]** All right, y'all, let's sing it all together.

**[00:01:41 - 00:01:44]** I'm going to miss Nico.

**[00:01:44 - 00:01:45]** Nico?

**[00:01:45 - 00:01:47]** Nico Ryan.

**[00:01:48 - 00:01:50]** Because he left me for a fish.

**[00:01:51 - 00:01:53]** But now I'm drinking.

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:55]** Because now he's lying dead.

**[00:01:55 - 00:01:56]** Lying dead.

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** And I'm drinking.

**[00:01:57 - 00:01:58]** Again.

**[00:01:59 - 00:01:59]** Again.

**[00:01:59 - 00:02:04]** I mean, I think, you know, it's December 1st.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:05]** Yeah.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:06]** Yeah.

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:08]** There was a ballad of Nico Orion.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:11]** A ballad of Nico Orion.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:13]** Coming to your radio soon.

**[00:02:13 - 00:02:15]** Your truck radio soon enough.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:16]** By Crush Casbah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:34]** I don't know what's going to happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:36]** Guys, I haven't looked ahead.

**[00:02:36 - 00:02:37]** I really haven't.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:39]** I have not looked ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:42]** I'm going to admit a lot of things that I didn't do.

**[00:02:43 - 00:02:44]** Seriously, no.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:47]** I don't know what's happening.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:49]** He has a premonition, folks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:50]** You don't know what's happening?

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** No, because he's never paying attention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:53 - 00:02:54]** Oh, that's right.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:59]** I forgot about that part, that he just doesn't pay attention.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:00]** Yeah, that's good.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:05]** Well, I mean, seriously, do any of us really know what's happening right now?

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:08]** That's a whole other discussion, but... Not really.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:10]** When the doll came to life, that was kind of it for me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:10 - 00:03:14]** Yeah, it's... Anyway.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:17]** Look, I think we should just acknowledge that it's December 1st.

**[00:03:18 - 00:03:21]** And in December, it's the season of giving.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:22]** Winter is coming.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** Winter is coming.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** Winter is coming.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:27]** Unless you're in LA and it's like 90 degrees on...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** You know, winter's already started.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:32]** Hard collar bells, sweet silver bells, all seem to say Nico's gonna die.


## Speaker_0

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:38]** I think the single can be a cross-genre banger.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:40]** That's what it sounds like to me.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:41]** Yeah.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:49]** Look, so it's the season of giving, so I think we need to give Nick the credit that he has put in the work, right?

**[00:03:49 - 00:03:52]** He's put in the work to do what we've given him.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:55]** We've given him a bit of lip.

**[00:03:55 - 00:03:56]** So much grief over.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** So much grief.

**[00:03:58 - 00:03:59]** So what'd you do, Nick?

**[00:03:59 - 00:03:59]** Over what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:04]** I feel as my premonition, now that I get to finish the thought here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:04 - 00:04:10]** I'm going to just interrupt you right now just so I can say that I interrupted you again.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:10]** You dick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:19]** I think, oh, I swear to God, John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:19 - 00:04:20]** Actually, I think it was this one.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:23]** That's the one that it is.

**[00:04:24 - 00:04:29]** All right, Nick, what are you giving us besides this sweet country?

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** All right, Christmas gifts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:35]** So I created a backup character.

**[00:04:35 - 00:04:36]** Wow.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** Wow.

**[00:04:38 - 00:04:40]** I created a backup character, and here's why.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** Why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** That's everyone cheering for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:42 - 00:04:43]** He's going to die.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** He knows this.

**[00:04:44 - 00:04:47]** We are halfway through book two right now, right?

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:50]** I can neither confirm nor deny that.

**[00:04:51 - 00:04:52]** It kind of feels like we're halfway through.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** I think so.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:57]** We are all kind of banged up in one way, shape, or another.

**[00:04:57 - 00:05:02]** And we don't really have an easy way of kind of healing ourselves up.

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:10]** And I think we're going to just come up with something that we're going to come across something that's going to be beyond any of us.

**[00:05:10 - 00:05:12]** Cue the Gandalf quote there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:13 - 00:05:15]** This foe is beyond any of you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** Run!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:16 - 00:05:18]** Run, you fools!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** Fly, you fools!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:23]** Fly!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:26]** But I just feel like we're going to come across something that we can't defeat.

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:31]** We're going to try and defeat it, and then someone's going to get roasted, and it's probably going to be me.

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:35]** That's a good possibility.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:39]** Just wanted to throw that out there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]** I'll be the first to say thank you, Nick.

**[00:05:41 - 00:05:46]** I am very proud of you for finally making a backup character since you are the one that is definitely going to die first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** Yep.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** Absolutely.

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:50]** Unless I die right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:54]** I don't think you're going to die from a little doll, man.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** I don't know, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:58]** There's all kinds of surprises in this AP game.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:09]** This doll is going to be like... And then it's going to just blast Dr. K in the face.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:12]** Do you guys remember Chucky doll in Ready Player One?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** Vaguely, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:14 - 00:06:15]** Yeah, where was it at?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** You're talking about the movie, right?

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** It's at the end.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** It's towards the end, the final...

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:19]** Big fight.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:24]** I love Small Soldiers.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:29]** I watched that movie so many times when I was a kid because it was always on HBO.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** It's on Amazon Prime right now.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Yeah, it's great.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** It's a fantastic movie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:34]** You didn't like Ready Player One?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:34 - 00:06:39]** And I've never read the book either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:41]** Yeah, because now there's Ready Player Two.

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:43]** So... Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:46]** But Small Soldiers is phenomenal.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:49]** And I think my biggest thing with Small Soldiers is... We've talked about Small Soldiers before, though.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:55]** I know, but, like, the... I think that all the...

**[00:06:55 - 00:07:14]** the graphics and and all that stuff it was almost like jurassic park in a sense that they were going above and beyond what other films had done for that same time period like go back and watch small soldiers and be impressed by like watched it yeah i loved it it was great but like they also had a great message it did


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:18]** Oh yeah, don't judge people based on how they look and stuff like that.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:21]** Yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:23]** Because the soldiers are actually the bad guys.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:23]** Spoiler alert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:29]** Yeah, maybe it's a commentary on... Don't spoil the movie, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:31]** You're just like Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:33]** You just spoil everything.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:34]** You know what, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:35]** I resent that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:35 - 00:07:37]** I resent that.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:40]** Before we started playing, I resemble that remark.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:47]** Nick, you literally, like before we got on, you were starting to talk about your backup character.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:53]** And it's like, no, you got, hey, what stays, what the set off air stays off air.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:54]** It's like Vegas, John.

**[00:07:54 - 00:07:56]** Don't break rule number one.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** That's not true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** We've never abided by that rule ever.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:59 - 00:07:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:59 - 00:08:02]** And debt kind of follows you around, too.

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** Debt follows you around.

**[00:08:03 - 00:08:04]** The mob.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** The mob, yeah.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:06]** The mob.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:09]** I guess you can never escape the mob, huh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** You can't escape the mob.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:13]** I didn't know that because I wasn't born in the 1910s.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:20]** And by mob, I mean, of course, the conglomerate MGM Grand Universal and whoever else, the casino-run people.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:20 - 00:08:26]** And if any of you listeners work for the mob or Avidar Corp or MGM...

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:27]** Thank you for listening.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:29]** We appreciate it.

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:32]** Sponsor us.

**[00:08:32 - 00:08:32]** Yeah, sure.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:33]** Sponsor us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:36]** If you want to make a shell company through which to sponsor us, that's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:39]** I want to make a shell company called Shell.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:42]** We'll save the shell company.

**[00:08:42 - 00:08:43]** We'll save the shell company.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:44 - 00:08:46]** They own a bunch of gas stations.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:46 - 00:08:47]** Should we play?

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** Yeah, let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** Let's do it.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** I think we should play.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** I think we should play too.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** I think we should see how I die.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** I don't think you're going to die, man.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:56]** I think someone's going to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** I think this thing's going to slit my throat.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:01]** I think someone's going to die in the next three episodes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:01 - 00:09:03]** I learned from Small Soldiers.

**[00:09:03 - 00:09:06]** We just need to do an EMP blast and they'll all just collapse and die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** There you go.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:09]** That's actually a really good idea.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:11]** Don't jinx us.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** I'm not jinxing you.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** I'm just calling it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:22]** The small soldiers that we do like, we have to put underneath a TV satellite dish to protect them from the EMP blasts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:22]** Right.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:23]** Spoiler alert.

**[00:09:23 - 00:09:27]** A Faraday cage, as it's commonly called.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:29]** By every school child.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:31]** By every school child.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:32 - 00:09:37]** I think everyone should go on Twitter and tweet at us who they think the first person in our group is going to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** I think we already know the answer.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:41]** We already know the answer to that.

**[00:09:41 - 00:09:42]** It's definitely going to be you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:46]** I still think we should do it because I think, Rick, you might do it just because you're a murder bot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** I might die first because I'm a murder bot?

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:52]** That's like counterintuitive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:52 - 00:09:54]** Ask Niedermeyer how that worked out for him on Animal House.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Alright, you guys.

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** Before we start.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:05]** Before we start.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:08]** Get it?

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:11]** Alright, what were you saying, John?

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:12]** Before we start.

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:14]** I want you guys to close your eyes.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:21]** It's dark in here.

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** Just take a second.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:24]** Take a breath.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** If you're listening, I can safely do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:33]** Sorry, Joe.

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** You don't need to apologize.

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** A good joke's a good joke.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:38]** It's dark in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:38 - 00:10:40]** That's a dog eating an avocado.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:42]** Nico's gonna die.

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:45]** That feels like a dog eating an avocado.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:47]** But I can't tell.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:55 - 00:11:01]** The atmosphere at the breakfast service was uneasy, to say the least.

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:12]** The luxurious dining space for the Sugesta's most valued passengers had been infiltrated by the very enemy it was designed to keep out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:14]** Fear.

**[00:11:14 - 00:11:14]** Fear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:26]** Everyone on the suite's floor had heard Zanka's screams, her furious footsteps beating down the hall, then several more sets of footsteps just seconds later.

**[00:11:27 - 00:11:31]** Security on this floor was always the best one could have.

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:38]** And so, this morning, guards were posted in the dining room, discreet but noticeable.

**[00:11:39 - 00:11:53]** It did nothing to abate the tension as hushed voices and speculative tones filled the typically jubilant air and gave life to the rumor that a child was missing from the Suggesta.

**[00:11:55 - 00:11:59]** Scans apparently showed no life form aboard.

**[00:11:59 - 00:12:03]** and all escape pods and service vessels were accounted for.

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:08]** Few faces looked up from their food.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:26]** Even the children, some of whom had heard the commotion last night, couldn't quite process that the same ship friend they'd made, who had had a food fight in this very room seemingly hours ago, was apparently no longer aboard the ship at all.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:42]** We see one table in particular, where two young boys sit softly eating the food their father had specifically prepared for them.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:50]** Castor belly and water eggs and a single pancake from the ship's famous skittermander chef, Pula Voodoo.

**[00:12:52 - 00:13:05]** Marcus absentmindedly stares at his coffee as a dragonkin talking head gives the morning newsflash on the table's hollow display.

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:11]** Thank you, Sarai, for that inspiring piece on the Great Eoxian Bake Off.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:13]** It's 7.50 a.m.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** on Absalom Station.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:18]** I'm Dick Denali, and you're watching The Morning Rotation.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:39]** Dragonkin, Dick, cuts to Camera B. In major news this morning, the biotech industry is in disbelief as Brathedon government agencies and the stewards enact strict and unprecedented oversight as they begin investigations into the breakout at Diorama Research and Development.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:45]** For more, we turn to our Brathedon correspondent, Brian Laserman, Intralidium.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:47]** Brian?

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:56]** The slow gears turn in Marcus's absent mind, and they click into place, and he speaks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:58 - 00:13:59]** Listen up, boys.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:02]** I'm shipping you out today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:09]** It's not safe here with- But, Dad, we never get to travel with you.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:18]** says the blonde boy, 10 or 11 years of age, putting his fork down as his quality flight shirt is stained with pancake syrup.

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:24]** Marcus surveys his oldest and wonders how much he misses out on.

**[00:14:25 - 00:14:26]** He didn't know how to treat him.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:35]** He remembered him as a small child, not this boy shaped by the myriad of sports and classes that his mother pushed on him.

**[00:14:36 - 00:14:41]** Plus, we haven't gotten a chance to even fly in the hangar.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:48]** Marcus turns to look at his other son, the brown-haired boy, younger, but continues without missing a beat.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:51]** What's happened here is why you're not coming with me.

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:56]** Bad circumstances can happen at any time.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:56]** You never know.

**[00:14:57 - 00:15:10]** And once again, he's interrupted not by the sound of the cafeteria door opening, but by the sounds of several sharp intakes of breath and one loud voice screaming, Marcus!

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:25]** Turning to look, there's a young Sheeran boy, previously found nowhere on the ship, is standing in the doorway, bleary-eyed, and still wearing pajamas from the night before.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:36]** He falls face forward as passengers rush over to help him, and you can just barely hear him say, Where am I?

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:42]** before Zanka runs over and squeezes his small frame.

**[00:15:42 - 00:15:45]** Several patrons have pulled their devices out.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:53]** Some are filming the unexpected reunion, while the security detail lags briefly, unsure, not prepared.

**[00:15:53 - 00:16:00]** For this, and unsure of what the protocol is, Marcus turns back and sees his boys staring.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:01 - 00:16:10]** He doubts himself for just a moment, and then clears his throat as his boys turn back to look at him.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:15]** He replies, Find one flight, then you're out of here.

**[00:16:17 - 00:16:20]** Those words would come to be his biggest regret.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:28]** And so we come back.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:35]** To the room where Dr. OK and Rick and Nico and Hears are in.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:37]** And we're about to go into combat.

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:40]** Kev, you sounded like you wanted to say something.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:43]** What did you want to say before I hit this combat music?

**[00:16:43 - 00:16:45]** Once I hit it, I can't stop it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** Excellent work, John.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** You are always so good at that.

**[00:16:49 - 00:16:50]** But I do want to talk about what just happened.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:54]** So this is another one of those... It's a flashback or something that we're thinking of.

**[00:16:55 - 00:16:56]** Um...

**[00:16:56 - 00:17:07]** The last time we heard from this group, they're on a ship somewhere, and one of the little boys saw dark black eyes in their closet.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** Glassy black eyes.

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:11]** And now the boy's been missing?

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:13]** How long did you say the boy was missing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:17]** It seemed like that had happened just the previous night.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** This is the morning after.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** So he's only been missing for a day.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:23]** But then he just shows up randomly.


## Speaker_0

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:23]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:30]** They're just going to pretend like he's just been hiding, but we all should know exactly what's going on.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:32]** Poor thing was abducted and probed.

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:34]** Yeah, probably.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:34]** Yeah.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:37]** Yikes.

**[00:17:38 - 00:17:41]** So, John, here's a question I have regarding these flashbacks.

**[00:17:42 - 00:17:46]** Are these things that the characters are just kind of gleaning or seeing?

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:53]** Is this something that's being sent to us telepathically, or are you just telling us as the players for us to internalize?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:55]** I'm telling you guys as the players.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:17:57 - 00:18:00]** Now that's an avocado-eating dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:01]** Thank you, Fuel.

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:02]** I agree.

**[00:18:02 - 00:18:03]** Thank you.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** I agree, Will.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:06]** Yes.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:08]** An avocado-eating dog, indeed.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:09]** Avocado-eating dog.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:10]** Never seen it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:14]** I've never eaten avocados before like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:20]** John, you know what you were doing when you were doing the news broadcast?

**[00:18:20 - 00:18:21]** Yeah.

**[00:18:21 - 00:18:22]** When you changed it over to the second guy.

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:27]** And now, such and such, ready for the report, I had the...

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:31]** From the Bruce Almighty movie, Steve Carell's gibberish thing going through my head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:41]** Is that from Bruce Almighty?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:42]** It is.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:43]** It is.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:47]** All right, so Step Brothers 2008.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:49]** Step Brothers 2008.

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** Which I watched last night, but I won't get into it.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:51]** Every time.

**[00:18:52 - 00:18:53]** So...

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:56]** Do you guys remember what happened last time?

**[00:18:56 - 00:18:57]** Do we want to recap?

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** I was drunk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:18:59 - 00:19:01]** I want to recap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** Okay.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:07]** Don't forget that you guys had your round two.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:33]** this feral gray bounder and as a result you threw in a grenade which caused the already unstable room to be even more unstable rocks started falling from the ceiling and as a result there was a rock that fell on a device that you think maybe could have been some sort of communication device


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:38]** Now we smell what that rock was cooking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:41]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:42]** That was great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:49]** That was... The Rock, by the way, listens to us every Wednesday morning while he's working out, even during his filming of Black Adam.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** Yep.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** We're just waiting on the Twitter confirmation.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:53]** So we like to tell our tourists.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:54]** Yeah.

**[00:19:54 - 00:19:55]** Yep.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:55]** Yep.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:57]** We have good authority, though.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:59]** Yeah, really good authority.

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:04]** So this is close to the... His trainer told me that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:05 - 00:20:05]** His trainer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** I heard Terry Crews.

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:08]** Oh, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:11]** Wait, Terry Crews is The Rock's trainer?

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** That makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:14]** I'll say no, no.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:19]** That would be like two amazing universes just colliding into some crazy thing.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:24]** But apparently he's a big supposedly tabletop guy.

**[00:20:24 - 00:20:25]** I'd have to check the sources on this.

**[00:20:25 - 00:20:26]** I've just heard about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:32]** He played an episode of Celebrity D&D.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:33]** He did.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:36]** They've had a lot of those.

**[00:20:36 - 00:20:37]** So did Vin Diesel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:38 - 00:20:41]** Well, so Vin Diesel's always been into D&D.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:43]** He has always been a big D&D guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:48]** But we don't discuss Vin Diesel because The Rock has a personal issue with him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:48 - 00:20:48]** Does he really?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** And we signed The Rock on that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:51]** Yep.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:55]** Wait, why did we sign with The Rock?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** Because I like The Rock better.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:57]** That's why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:58 - 00:20:58]** Yeah, sorry.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** Sorry, Vin.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:04]** Maybe Vin can join on the other show, Bill Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:15]** I didn't read up on what was going on exactly, but it was basically like they were having a feud, and it got to the point where The Rock said he wouldn't film anything with Fast and Furious.

**[00:21:15 - 00:21:16]** I think the last one was.

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:21]** He wouldn't be in the movie if he had to film in any scenes with Vin Diesel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:25]** I guess Vindy has also kept giving him to be like, you need to be a better actor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:28]** Anyway.

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:33]** In the long run, though, people have actually come to The Rock and said, no, you were right, man.

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:37]** The cast and crew members have said, yeah, this is kind of a jerk.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** Oh, wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** That's good.

**[00:21:39 - 00:21:43]** Does this preclude us from hanging out with Terry Crews, though?

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:43]** I'm just curious.

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** No, not at all.

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** Terry Crews is great.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:47]** I've heard good things about him.

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:49]** Let's get Crews to hang out with us, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:52]** Maybe we can mend some fences, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:53]** Yeah.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:53]** You know what?

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:55]** That's what we do here.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:55]** We'll save.

**[00:21:55 - 00:21:58]** We play Starfinder, and we mend fences.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:00]** Men's space fences.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:03]** So anyway, keep this in mind.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:04]** Let's murder this doll.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:17]** In the previous room, you discover that the gray was killed by something that rendered it from limb to limb by a creature that can move without touching the ground.

**[00:22:17 - 00:22:18]** A flying troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:21]** Chucky doll from Ready Player One.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:22]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:23 - 00:22:33]** You come into this room where the only source of light is this fusion fizz vending machine where there's gems, plastic pieces all over the floor.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** There's a box of dolls in the corner.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:46]** As Rick explores his mind, as he comes close to the fusion fizz machine, his mind transports him somewhere.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:47]** Something happens.

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:52]** Dr. OK, you're looking at the dolls.

**[00:22:53 - 00:23:12]** And then out of the corner of your eye, just before you can react, one of the tops of the boxes pops up and two claws stick out and go, this little Sheeran toy leaps forward to attack you.

**[00:23:12 - 00:23:15]** And now we roll for initiative.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:18]** Roll for initiative.

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:22]** Roll for natural 20.

**[00:23:23 - 00:23:25]** Let's go in order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:27]** Your dice gently on your pads.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:30]** Anybody get above a 20?

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:32]** I did.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:32]** I did.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** Okay, let's go with Rick and I team.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:35]** What'd you get?

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:36]** I got 24.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** Dang.

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:38]** All right.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** Doctor, you're okay.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:41]** You got what?

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:41]** 21.

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:42]** 21.

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:44]** Fierce.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:45]** 15 and up?

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:47]** No.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:49]** Oh, 15 and up was me.

**[00:23:49 - 00:23:50]** Sorry.

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:50]** 15 and up was me.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:51]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:51]** What'd you get?

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:52]** 17.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** 17.

**[00:23:54 - 00:23:55]** Here's what you get.

**[00:23:56 - 00:23:57]** Basically zero.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:57]** I got a three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:59]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:59 - 00:24:00]** Basically zero.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:01]** Basically zero.

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:02]** I go last.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:04]** Yeah.

**[00:24:04 - 00:24:04]** Yeah.

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:05]** Maybe.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:06]** Maybe.

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:07]** Unless this doll rolls lower.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:09]** Let me pull you guys over to...

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:34]** the map on roll 20 and as we do i'm gonna click on the old little doll toy here and i'm gonna share it check out this creature adorable wait sure it don't look like that i mean with the arms what's happening with the arms there this looks like a praying mantis yeah it's like a weird yeah it's like a characterized thing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:37]** It looks like Scyther plus a Shirin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:38]** Yeah.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:39]** Yeah.

**[00:24:39 - 00:24:44]** It's like a Scyther and a Shirin with these long arms and then these big yellow eyes.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:48]** And then the arms are just these pincers.

**[00:24:48 - 00:24:53]** And there's no smaller arms that Shirin typically have that actually I was reading about.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:58]** Here's very interesting that I don't know if you knew this, but Shirin had these other, right?

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** They have the other appendages, but they're like kind of short.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:03]** They're like T-Rex arms, but they're only used for like...

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:07]** And, like, if you were to use them in any other context, it would be rude.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:08]** Right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** I did know this because I am sheer.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** I didn't know this.

**[00:25:11 - 00:25:11]** Obviously.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** And I'm just saying it was super cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:16]** I knew this because I drew here as a sheer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** That's true.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:20]** Sometimes I, like, flip you guys off and you don't even realize.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:21]** That's right.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:22]** Tiny hands.

**[00:25:22 - 00:25:23]** Because you don't understand.

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:24]** This is amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:28]** I have high perception, so I definitely saw that.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:28]** Okay.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:28]** And you knew what it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:30]** Rick has eyes on the back of his head.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:37]** I was going to say your unseen servant just is constantly walking around giving us double fingers the whole time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:39 - 00:25:40]** Six cents.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:43]** Chad does what Chad wants.

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:45]** I'm going to turn down a little bit because I'm peeking.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:45]** All right.

**[00:25:45 - 00:25:46]** So, Dr.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:50]** O.K., let's get rolling in this combat.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:51]** Dr.

**[00:25:51 - 00:25:55]** O.K., there is a surprise round, and this creature is going to attack you.

**[00:25:55 - 00:25:56]** Chad does like to hang.

**[00:25:56 - 00:25:57]** I mean...

**[00:25:57 - 00:26:01]** This creature lunges forward at Dr. O.K.

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:05]** Let's roll some dice.

**[00:26:05 - 00:26:09]** These ting-ting cutters come out and attack Dr.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:09]** O.K.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:09]** 's leg.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:13]** That is a 16 against KAC.

**[00:26:13 - 00:26:14]** Does that hit Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:15]** O.K.?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:15 - 00:26:15]** That hits.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:17]** Oh, that hits.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:26]** All right, so one cutter, I picture, just cuts into you, and the other pierces you kind of together.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** They just go, and it's all one attack.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** It's a double attack?

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:32]** No, it's flavor.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:32]** It's flavor.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:33]** Okay.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:34]** Yeah.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:36]** For a total of eight points of damage, though.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:37]** Holy cow.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:37]** Yeah.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:43]** This thing is tiny, but can do a lot.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:45]** Stephen Scyther.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:46]** Scyther!

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** Scyther!

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** I would love to go.

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:53]** I believe next is going to be Ulrich19.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Top of round one.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:02]** Before we do anything else, I'm going to do perception on the room to see if I can sense any more of these little robots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** Yeah.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** I'll give that to you for free, dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:13]** I rolled a three with a plus six or nine total.

**[00:27:13 - 00:27:14]** You are...

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:16]** Not quite sure.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:16]** Yeah.

**[00:27:16 - 00:27:17]** But I do have a passive.

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:20]** Where's my passive perception, which is much higher.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:21]** What is your passive perception?

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:22]** I don't know.

**[00:27:22 - 00:27:23]** I'm trying to find it.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** Find it faster!

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:26]** No, never mind.

**[00:27:26 - 00:27:26]** I can't find it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:27]** Okay, great.

**[00:27:27 - 00:27:33]** You don't notice anything except that the beads at your feet are your favorite color.

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:34]** That's what you notice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:35 - 00:27:36]** It's very important.

**[00:27:37 - 00:27:43]** With that, I'm gonna just... I see what's happening over with Dr. Okay.

**[00:27:43 - 00:27:44]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:46]** You snap out of your reverie, whatever it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:47 - 00:27:52]** Yeah, he's like... Peripheral sees this thing jump out and attack, and so he...

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:58]** He just immediately drops his hand down, grabs his axe, and just stomps over towards it.

**[00:28:00 - 00:28:02]** And hacks at it.

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:08]** So that's going to be... You jump over this pile of stuff.

**[00:28:08 - 00:28:37]** 15 plus 5 my axe oh man you swing this giant axe at this tiny with precision with precision and you hit of course I hit of course he says alright that's gonna be 1d12 plus give him some damage get this fiend off of me Rick

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:43]** That's seven plus four is 11 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:46]** Seven plus four is 11 points of damage.

**[00:28:46 - 00:28:47]** Outrageous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:48]** Just splits this little doll in half.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** Just crushes it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:50]** All right.

**[00:28:50 - 00:29:00]** It is still up, but you definitely go through, and I feel like you come down, and the cutter, the pincer that was in Dr.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:00]** O.K.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:03]** 's body, you just slice right through it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** So it's still in his body?

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:08]** So it's sticking out like a tiny little thorn.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** That's great.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:13]** You want to do anything else with that turn of yours?

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:14]** That's my whole turn?

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:15]** That's your whole turn.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:17]** Dr. O'K, what are you going to do?

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:19]** How are you going to respond to this creature?

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:25]** I'm hurt by this thorny thing and I don't know what it is.

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** So I'm going to take a quick look at it.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:29]** Take a quick look.

**[00:29:30 - 00:29:32]** Maybe like a life science check to identify the creature?

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:33]** Maybe.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:34]** Maybe.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:34]** Maybe.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:35]** 24.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:35]** 24.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** Okay.

**[00:29:36 - 00:29:39]** I'm going to say you got one half.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:42]** I think you just got five over it.

**[00:29:42 - 00:29:46]** This is a weaponized devil in a box.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:52]** The tiny, like, construct technological creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:52 - 00:29:54]** Would life science tell you that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:54 - 00:29:59]** Yeah, I can identify something that could also be identified by life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:59 - 00:30:00]** I think, yeah.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** I think you would know what this is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** That was more like a generic Starfinder question than it was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:06 - 00:30:07]** Okay.

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:08]** Okay, good talk.

**[00:30:09 - 00:30:10]** One thing about it.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:10]** What do you want to know?

**[00:30:11 - 00:30:12]** Get one thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** His favorite color.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:16 - 00:30:16]** Weaknesses.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:18]** Weaknesses.

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:21]** Well, I'll give you the color for free.

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:22]** Green?

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:23]** Nope.

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:24]** It's taupe.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:25]** Taupe.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:26]** Of course.

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:27]** Interesting.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:28]** Didn't expect taupe.

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:29]** Makes perfect sense.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:32]** Yeah, it makes perfect sense for a small green plush toy.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:36]** He really likes the color of office furniture.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:42]** Yeah, because, you know, it's different than the magical, vibrant world in which it lives.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:44]** Weaknesses.

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:47]** It is vulnerable to critical hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:58]** John, I'm sorry, but it says creature types construct magical as mysticism, construct technological as engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:02]** You're saying that life science gave us this?

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:17]** well i could identify something that is normally identified by mysticism check with a life science check because of my highest science so technically this would have been engineering so do you want me to roll engineering which i could also do yes i'm op on that


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:17 - 00:31:18]** Just roll it instead.

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:23]** Well, that's great because I rolled a natural 19.

**[00:31:24 - 00:31:26]** Perfect.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:26]** 27.

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:27]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:28 - 00:31:30]** I just want us to play by the rules, Jordan.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:31]** I also want to play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:34]** It's like coup de grace.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** You only have one thing.

**[00:31:36 - 00:31:37]** Even with the 27, you're only one thing.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:38]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:39]** So that is it.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:42]** What would you like to do now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:48]** I want to... Is this, like, thing that is stuck in me mechanically hurting me in any way?

**[00:31:48 - 00:31:48]** No.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** Okay.

**[00:31:51 - 00:31:55]** So as, like, sort of, you know, free action...

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:58]** This thing and I'll pull it out.

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:01]** You should get a jab of this instead.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:07]** And then I hit him with a minor inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** Minor inhibitor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:10]** Okay.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:14]** Take a minus one penalty to your future attack rolls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:15]** Dang.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:16]** Seven rounds.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** Dang.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:17]** Okay.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:20]** And that's if you hit on KAC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:22]** Yes.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:27]** And I have equipped my tactical syringe spear.

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:31]** So I'm just going to hit him with the spear.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:33 - 00:32:38]** And that is a 15 to hit.

**[00:32:38 - 00:32:40]** A 15 does not hit.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:48]** Just get this creature off of me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:50]** Yeah.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** I guess I'm going to take a guarded step back.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:54]** Would have 14 have hit you?

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:55]** No.

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:56]** Okay.

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:04]** Then I'm going to roll back and say that you were not hit because I realized that if the creature is still inside the box, it takes a penalty to its attack rolls.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:07]** So it was still inside the box.

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:09]** So I get my eight points back.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** You get your eight HP back.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** Yeah.

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:36]** nice but it does have some partial cover okay well um i still take a guarded step back that's fine i'm gonna say that you still cut off one of its little cutters rick because it was sticking it out trying to hope to jab dr okay so dr okay takes you gotta get away from this thing yeah go you get in there nico always dependent to jump in


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:36 - 00:34:01]** jump jets away jump jets away is this one of your fail toys nico nico it's your turn what are you doing so nico is going to all right john so this is what i want to do i want to do a jump jets over the top and nico wants to take a shot as he's flying over okay um i don't know if i can do that because i think technically you need like a feet to do fire on the move i think it's called that is true


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:01 - 00:34:02]** Yeah, I think you do.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:06]** So if you don't have that, I'm just going to say you probably can't do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:06]** All right, fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:07 - 00:34:08]** Then I just want to do combat expertise.

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:12]** Without a lot of penalties.

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:35]** so you gotta look at combat expertise combat expertise all right so what do you do i'll be like hello ugly and he's just gonna take a shot and he's gonna roll his bluff check here you're gonna want to move though because you're standing behind a vending machine and doctor okay straight behind it so it pretty much has like improved cover but i'm just so awesome like don't you know

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:38]** If you want to shoot from there, be my guest.

## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:42]** Be our guest.

**[00:34:43 - 00:34:46]** From the words, put your aiming to the test.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:48]** So I'll do a combat expertise here.

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:50]** So here I'm rolling.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:50 - 00:34:50]** Okay.

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:53]** And the combat expertise is what again?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:56]** Combat expertise is I roll a bluff.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:59]** For me, I roll a bluff check against...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:59 - 00:34:59]** That's right.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:00]** DC.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:04]** Against DC equal to 15 plus one to one and a half.

**[00:35:04 - 00:35:04]** Yep.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:05]** Yeah.

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:08]** One to or half your target CR.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:08]** Okay.

**[00:35:08 - 00:35:09]** Go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:12]** So if I do, then I get to add a D6 to my damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:13]** DC 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:14]** Yep.

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:15]** DC 18.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:15]** Perfect.

**[00:35:15 - 00:35:18]** I got 11 on the die plus nine.

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** Wait, just making sure for my bluff.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:21]** Yep.

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:22]** Plus nine.

**[00:35:22 - 00:35:23]** So that's a 20 dude.

**[00:35:23 - 00:35:24]** Nice.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:24]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:26]** So what do you do to bluff?

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:29]** As I said, hello, ugly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:31]** And it's going to look at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:31]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:32 - 00:35:35]** And he takes a shot and here's the hit.

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:41]** I think emotionally it worries because it's a cute plush toy and you just call it ugly.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:43]** So I feel like you did a little bit of mental damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:44]** It's self-esteem.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:45 - 00:35:46]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:48]** Some self-esteem damage.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:50]** Nico knows how to push people's buttons.

**[00:35:50 - 00:35:51]** He does.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:55]** So that's a 15 on the dice plus 4 to hit.

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:59]** So that's 19 to hit.

**[00:35:59 - 00:35:59]** 19.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:01]** You just hit.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:04]** Nicely done with your shot.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:04]** Okay.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:05]** All right.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** Let's go ahead and let's roll this damage here.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:07]** Yeah.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:11]** Roll it up and add your extra D6.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:14]** That's five points of damage.

**[00:36:14 - 00:36:17]** Five points of damage as you... What are you shooting with?

**[00:36:17 - 00:36:19]** An azimuth laser pistol.

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:20]** Azimuth laser pistol.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:20]** That's energy.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** Yep.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:21]** Yeah.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:23]** So you...

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:34]** hit the creature four or five points of damage, and it leaves this sizzling mark on its otherwise perfect, fluffy, soft green fur.

**[00:36:35 - 00:36:36]** It's a plush toy.

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:37]** And now it thinks maybe it is ugly.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:44]** So now Nico's going to say, hey, look, let's make it spotted.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:44]** Rude.

**[00:36:45 - 00:36:46]** Rude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** It is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:48]** 101 ugly toys.

**[00:36:49 - 00:36:50]** You want to do anything else with your 10?

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:52]** No, just mock it a little bit more.

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:53]** Just mock it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:56]** This is why you always get attacked first, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:56 - 00:36:58]** This is probably why you always get attacked first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:00]** This is probably why I'm going to have a new character first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:06]** I think it, although it was disheartened by Nico...

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:11]** It takes its little plush toy rage and it turns to attack Rick.

**[00:37:11 - 00:37:21]** And you see it like the box moves forward as it shuffles forward to attack you, Rick 19.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:25]** Let's see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:26]** Let the bodies hit the floor.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:28]** Let the bodies hit the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:30]** Let's see.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:34]** As it swings out, this little tiny creature

**[00:37:34 - 00:37:34]** Ooh.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:39]** Dang, I'm not rolling great today with the glassy purple die.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:40]** That's a 15.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** Ooh.

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:43]** Against your KAC.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:45]** Just miss a Rooney.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:46 - 00:37:48]** He, like, swings and Rick just kind of pulls his foot back.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:54]** Also, John, don't forget with the combat expertise, you are shaking for one round.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:55]** Oh, I wish you had told me that before.

**[00:37:55 - 00:37:57]** Okay, so I'm shaking for one round, and Dr.

**[00:37:58 - 00:37:59]** O.K., you missed, right?

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** So there's no minor inhibitor.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:03]** That's fine.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:06]** Okay, so it goes.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:09]** Try to swing at Rick with the cutter.

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:14]** Misses as Rick just moves your foot back a little bit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** And it's going to be... Here's his turn.

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:16]** What are you doing?

**[00:38:17 - 00:38:22]** So can we, like, screw with it to, like, demotivate it by insulting it if we keep this up?


## Speaker_0

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:22]** Ha ha ha!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:24]** Like, maybe, like, deep off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:25]** I want to try.

**[00:38:26 - 00:38:27]** Let's do it.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:27]** You know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:31]** Can't wait.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:33]** It just gives up because it's so sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** It just, like, so embarrassed.

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:37]** It just, like, gets slopped over this, like, little toy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:37 - 00:38:37]** It's like, oh, God.

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** We feel really sad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:41]** You guys are right.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:45]** I mean, if that's possible, actually, mechanically, then I'll try.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** But like, you know what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:47 - 00:38:47]** I think it's funny.

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:52]** I think I will decide what it would actually mechanically happen to it.

**[00:38:52 - 00:39:02]** But if you want to try and go for it, I will say that you need to give me a role for I'm trying to think what probably either intimidate emotional love.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:02 - 00:39:04]** I'm going to look this up in the books.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:05]** Bluff?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:05 - 00:39:07]** I think it would just be shaken for an additional round.

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:10]** Or would it be... Yeah, Bluff.

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:11]** Intimidate.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:11 - 00:39:12]** It would be Intimidate, wouldn't it?

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** I think Intimidate.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:16]** So give me an Intimidate check.

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:20]** I'm not... I'm not super skilled in Intimidation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:23]** Yeah, in spite of the fact that here's his party, he's not a really good Intimidator somehow.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:24]** I don't know why.

**[00:39:24 - 00:39:26]** I'll give it to you as a free action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:26 - 00:39:30]** Dude, use those disrespectful appendages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:30 - 00:39:35]** I'll give it to you as a reaction if you come up with something clever to say.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:36]** Okay.

**[00:39:36 - 00:39:38]** I guess spotlight's on.

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** But you have to make a roll, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:40]** All right.

**[00:39:40 - 00:39:41]** We have faith in you.

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:44]** Here's just like, so why'd you get recall, huh?

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:47]** Does it have to do something with those freaky, freaky arms?

**[00:39:49 - 00:39:54]** You're the ugliest Sharon I've ever seen, and I've seen some ugly Sharons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:58 - 00:40:01]** Why did you get recalled?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:09]** You see the corner of its big yellow eyes slump down as it just hears your words having missed against Rick.

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:12]** And you see the shoulders get low.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:16]** This is amazing.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** All right.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:21]** And then give me an intimidate roll and add a plus two to it.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:23]** It's like a plus seven.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:24]** Come on.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:25]** That was so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:25 - 00:40:27]** It's an 11 with the plus two.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:28]** It's not very high.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:28 - 00:40:29]** Okay.

**[00:40:29 - 00:40:31]** I'll say that it's probably going to be shaken for another round.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** All right.

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:33]** Yeah.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:34]** Okay.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:34]** Yeah.

**[00:40:35 - 00:40:35]** That's good.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:36]** Which is good.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:39]** That's minus two to attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws.

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:43]** Like being shaken is great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:43]** Okay.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** Awesome.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:44]** Yeah.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:49]** And here's we'll also then attack with he's going to attempt to daze as well to daze him.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:50]** Okay.

**[00:40:50 - 00:40:52]** To short circuit his mind.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:55]** That's a DC of 15.

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** 15?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:57 - 00:40:59]** So we'll save 15?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:59 - 00:41:00]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Does he pass?

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:04]** The little fairy.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:05]** Rolled a 15.

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:06]** Wow.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:08]** Yeah.

**[00:41:08 - 00:41:10]** Thank you, Glassy P. Whatever.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:12]** I'm still ugly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:14]** All right, that's the end of your sister.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:16]** That's it.

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:25]** Well, I have a move action, so I'm just going to send Chad to this vending machine in the meantime and just have him check it out.

**[00:41:25 - 00:41:27]** I'm just going to press buttons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:28]** That's fine.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:30]** There are a couple flavors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:30 - 00:41:31]** Chad, go get me a soda.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** Yeah, there are a couple flavors.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:36]** There's Starstone Apple.

**[00:41:36 - 00:42:00]** uh leovara lush kind of tropical uh skitter rocket blast so like capri sun i think i've had that one which one skitter master skitter matter blast this is a rocket blast yeah yeah yeah there's also weirdly uh there's fanta fanta is also an option so you can do i haven't had that one i have not had that one

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:03]** Is it strawberry or orange?

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:05]** Or purple?

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:08]** It's definitely not... You know what?

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:09]** It's great.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** It's purple.

**[00:42:10 - 00:42:10]** It's the worst flavor.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:13]** It's the worst flavor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:14]** No one gets the great fantasy.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:15]** Right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:21]** You see those Fanta commercials and you see each one's like wearing a bikini according to their flavor.

**[00:42:22 - 00:42:24]** It's just like, nobody likes you purple.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:29]** Nobody likes the purple.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:30]** Poor purple.

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** We'll see.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:36]** You turn back to the doll and you're like, you're like a purple Fanta doll, aren't you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:36]** Exactly.

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:42]** Anything but a purple Fanta.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:42 - 00:42:45]** You're about as useless as purple Fanta, you freaking doll.

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:49]** Dude, we are ruining this toy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** You know what?

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** The code drop.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:55]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:55 - 00:43:01]** Well, Chad presses the Skidamander or whatever the heck Will enjoyed.

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:01]** It's out.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** He presses it repeatedly.

**[00:43:03 - 00:43:04]** Oh, it's out?

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:08]** He's intelligent enough to just keep pressing buttons, seeing what will happen.

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:13]** The only one they have is the Great Fanta.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:13]** That's it.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:16]** They all have Great Fanta.

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:20]** He presses that repeatedly over and over.

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:21]** He's going to get all the Great Fanta.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:23]** His dollar gets jammed.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:29]** It eats his coins.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:31]** Wait, do I get some grapefant or not?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:31 - 00:43:33]** No, because it eats his coins.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:39]** But you do notice that there are cans underneath some of the rubble here.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:47]** There's cans of some other stuff that you guys can maybe take a look at if not all of you die from the small plush toy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:48]** Okay, well, okay.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:50]** Maybe we'll explore that next time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:51]** Top of round two.

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:52]** It is.

**[00:43:52 - 00:43:53]** The Rick.

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** The 19th Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:56 - 00:44:03]** And he just... Rick just, like, very calmly, like, glances over at the other and watches all the ridiculousness that just happened.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:05]** Calling him a purple phantom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:05 - 00:44:08]** You just see these buttons just invisibly being pressed in behind you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:08 - 00:44:09]** Is this a time for...

**[00:44:09 - 00:44:11]** Drinking purple Fanta.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:12 - 00:44:13]** Come on, Chad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:22]** You just see purple Fanta dripping all over the floor because Chad doesn't actually have any type of thing.

**[00:44:22 - 00:44:24]** He's just tipping the can up.

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:26]** It's just all falling on the floor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:27 - 00:44:29]** An insatiable thirst.

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:33]** And then he just draws his axe back up and drops it again.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:37]** That's a nine plus...

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:39]** Five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:41]** Versus Casey.

**[00:44:42 - 00:44:43]** Not going to hit.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:47]** I feel like maybe you even just tried to drop it, you know, because it's so close and so tiny.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:49]** And you just miss.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:50]** You miss.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:55]** But I am going to do a guarded step to the other, like, behind it.

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:58]** So if anyone wants to step forward and flank with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:44:58 - 00:44:59]** Flank.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** Flank with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** Open flanking positions.

**[00:45:05 - 00:45:07]** Open flanking positions.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** I wasn't on a flank.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:16]** I think I see... Nick, I mean, Rick, are you... Oh, I think I know what's going on here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:20]** He just looks at you and winks.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:22]** Dr. K, it's your turn.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:24]** How do you respond to that wink?

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:25]** Yeah, to the...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:29]** That's how I respond.

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** We're a great team.

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:31]** Yes.

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:42]** I'm going to take hold of my tactical syringe spear, and I'm going to thrust it into this foul creature's face.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:47]** And I'm going to say, you rejected Beanie Baby.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** Die.


## Speaker_0

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:51]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:51 - 00:45:59]** And I actually rolled an 18 for a total of 21.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** You added the plus two in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:01 - 00:46:03]** No, I didn't add the plus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:04]** Because now we're flanking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:04 - 00:46:07]** 23.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:07]** 23.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:09]** Yeah, you absolutely hit 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:22]** And I'm hitting him with, I didn't say it ahead of time, but, which, I mean, I suppose I could not hit him with a thing, but I was going to hit him with a minor inhibitor again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:48]** okay so another if so he does take a minus one penalty to uh his attack rolls for okay seven rounds for seven rounds minus one to attack roll so right now he's got a minus three from the shaken sorry sorry yeah yeah did i say yeah i said minor inhibitor right minor inhibitor yeah so okay yeah minus one penalty to attack rolls minus one penalty to attack rolls okay

**[00:46:49 - 00:46:50]** All right.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:50]** Cool.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Like it.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** Love it.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** Actually, I don't love it.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:54]** Minus three to attack us.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:55]** Okay.

**[00:46:55 - 00:46:56]** And I hit.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:57]** For how much?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:58 - 00:46:58]** Ten points.

**[00:46:59 - 00:46:59]** Wow.

**[00:47:00 - 00:47:01]** A piercing damage.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:02]** Dang.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:02]** Rolled a five.

**[00:47:02 - 00:47:04]** This thing is dead.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:04]** It's got us.

**[00:47:04 - 00:47:05]** It's a small toy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:06]** It's still alive.

**[00:47:06 - 00:47:07]** It's still alive.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** What?

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:09]** Oh, God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:11]** You pierced it?

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:13]** Not even after the Beanie Baby comment?

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** I didn't destroy its spirits?

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:15]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:25]** Oh, its spirits are down the dumps, but you pull out just some mechanical little gears and also little fluff that comes in plush toys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:27 - 00:47:28]** Dude, stuffing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:28 - 00:47:34]** It is definitely looking like it is slowing down, but it is not dead.

**[00:47:34 - 00:47:35]** Nico, can you do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:35 - 00:47:40]** Nico wants to know whether or not for a little bit of flavor, he can just hit like a button on his belt.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:47]** And after seeing what Chad's doing over on the thing, he wants to know if he can play the phantom music out loud while we're all fighting this thing.

**[00:47:47 - 00:47:48]** The what music?

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:49]** The phantom music.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:49 - 00:47:50]** What the phantom?

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:52]** Don't you want the what the phantom?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:52 - 00:47:53]** Sure.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** You are a Fanta Batman.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** You look hot in all that plaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** Drink a Fanta faster, faster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:58]** Faster, faster.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** So he's going to hit that button and you just hear that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:02]** Want a Fanta?

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** Don't you want a Fanta?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:09]** And then he's going to, next thing he wants to do is he wants to roll a perception roll.

**[00:48:10 - 00:48:17]** And he wants to see if he can see on like its arm or something like that, like where it's made from, like made in EOX.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:30]** You already knew from last time that these toys, they reminded you of toys made by a company called Key Toys, which is a division of Abadar Corp.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** So we went over this last week.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:43]** They're basically, they were recalled because they use authentic Skittermander fur, which apparently was harvested from paid volunteers and was a big marketing feature for it.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:45]** So they are valuable, actually.

**[00:48:46 - 00:48:48]** In general, these toys are pretty valuable.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:48]** Yeah.

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:53]** This is the claw at the crab of... I don't know what claw at the crab is, but yes.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** Beanie baby.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** Oh, okay.

**[00:48:56 - 00:49:02]** So Nico's going to take a look at this thing, and as part of his combat expertise and his bluff, he's going to take a look at this thing.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:06]** He's like, gosh, if a child saw you right now, parents would cover their eyes.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:12]** You were ugly and horrendous to look at, you cheap piece of filth.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:15]** and he's going to roll his bluff check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** You're doing another combat expertise?

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:18]** Yep.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:18]** DC 18.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:21]** 16 on the dash plus 9.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** Dang, 25.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:25]** Impressive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:25 - 00:49:27]** This thing is not feeling okay.

**[00:49:28 - 00:49:30]** Can you kill it?

**[00:49:30 - 00:49:31]** All right, let's take a roll here.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:32]** Oh, wait.

**[00:49:32 - 00:49:33]** What was that?

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:34]** 19 plus four.

**[00:49:34 - 00:49:35]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:36]** What?

**[00:49:36 - 00:49:37]** Your damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:42]** I rolled a natty 19 plus four on my roll to hit.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:43]** Oh, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:44]** Yeah.

**[00:49:44 - 00:49:45]** That's awesome.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** Dang.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:48]** So you hit and you get an extra D6 of damage.

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:50]** That's what I'm talking about.

**[00:49:51 - 00:49:52]** How much damage you do?

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:53]** Can you kill it?

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:55]** What two dice are you rolling?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:57]** A D4, which was a four plus one.

**[00:49:57 - 00:49:58]** So that's five.

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:59]** Now roll my D6.

**[00:50:00 - 00:50:01]** Roll your D6.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:03]** Five.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:05]** Dang.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:07]** So 10 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** 10 points of damage as you shoot it.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:18]** And there's another black mark as the authentic Skittermander first sizzles and leaves most of its body burned.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:20]** But it is still up.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:21]** What the heck?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:25]** Nico Ryan's just going to say, hey guys, look, it's 101 Skittermanders.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:26]** Oh my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:35]** This toy realizes... This toy realizes that...

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:37]** To be significant in life.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:37 - 00:50:42]** It is being bullied with the phantom music in the background, which is absolutely humiliating.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:42 - 00:50:44]** It's being bullied.

**[00:50:44 - 00:50:45]** Will, what did you ask?

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:45]** Nothing.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:48]** I asked nothing.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:51]** You asked something, but I didn't hear what you asked.

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:52]** I don't remember it.

**[00:50:52 - 00:50:53]** Okay.

**[00:50:53 - 00:50:54]** Sorry.

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** I have a goldfish memory.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** Okay, cool.

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:57]** Be a goldfish.

**[00:50:58 - 00:50:58]** Be a goldfish.

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:01]** It is going to... Thank you, Ted Laszlo.

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:04]** It's going to realize its final moments.

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:06]** that it needs to make its life worth it.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** So, it's going to jump.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:10]** It's going to go for that Fanta.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** It's going to go for the Fanta.

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:18]** Now, it's going to go for Dr. Okay in one last attack.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:20]** One last confirmation.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:23]** It's still shaking.

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:24]** It is shaken.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** It has a minus three to its attack roll.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:29]** Can it hit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:34]** It's not looking good there, Cotton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:35 - 00:51:36]** Roll the 22.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:37]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:40]** Well, that hits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:41 - 00:51:41]** Yeah.

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:43]** He's gonna feel that one, Cotton.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** F and A, Cotton.

**[00:51:46 - 00:51:50]** F and A. It only has one cutter left.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:52]** Its body is pulled out.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:55]** There's little fuzz on the floor.

**[00:51:55 - 00:52:00]** There's the smell of burnt skittermander hair as its skin is charred.

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:05]** That is seven... No, eight points of damage to Dr. Okay.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:12]** As it stabs in with all the force that this tiny blood creature...

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** Oh my god.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** Okay.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:18]** You fell, f***ing beanie baby.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:26]** And with that curse, it feels its spirits lift as he has done the Lord's work.

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:55]** the lord of beanie babies ebay ebay is the lord of ebay here's oh hell ebay here's what are you gonna do here's maybe you should just let this little thing get off what do you mean you know just hey it's kind of inappropriate


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:59]** What the hell?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** Wait, what do you mean?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:04]** You know, you just give him some private space.

**[00:53:04 - 00:53:06]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:07]** Come on.

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:08]** Just give him a free pass.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** Just give him a free pass.

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:12]** Wait, why would I do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** We've now entered Ted.

**[00:53:14 - 00:53:17]** All right, because we can, like, what, conscript him or something?

**[00:53:17 - 00:53:19]** Is that something that comes to his mind?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:19 - 00:53:21]** No, I'm just saying you should implore mercy.

**[00:53:22 - 00:53:23]** That's it.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Just for a little plush toy.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:27]** What are you doing with your turn?

**[00:53:27 - 00:53:28]** You could kill it.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:30]** You could kill it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:41]** Okay, or like... No, I'm saying like you... I mean, I'm not... Unless I can get him to like hang out on my shoulder and be my little pal, then like I don't know how this is going to work out.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:41]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:44]** You guys have only belittled...

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:45]** this creature.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:47]** So I don't know how much it would take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:49]** I'm shocked that this is the only one in the room.

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:58]** This is like the whole battle that we talked about several episodes ago about an elephant-sized pigeon versus pigeon-sized elephants.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:01]** This is a pigeon-sized elephant.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:03]** Yeah, this is a pigeon-sized elephant.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:05]** There's only one of them, so it's, like, really not scary.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** Yeah, it's not.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** All right, well, okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Speak for yourself, Rick.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:13]** We're going to open the door, and the next room is going to be just, like, the same thing with John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:17]** All right, so, here's is going to, like, be like, no child will ever love you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:22]** But he'll be like, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:26]** And then while this is happening, Chad is going to be throwing purple Fanta generally in the direction.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:29]** It's all over the floor, right?

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:32]** Just to reemphasize that this is the purple Fanta of toys.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:39]** And then here's like, but I could love you if you stop being a jerk and maybe you could be my little pal.

**[00:54:39 - 00:54:40]** What do you say?

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:41]** Okay.

**[00:54:41 - 00:54:41]** What do you think?

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:45]** I don't want this thing to live, but... So you don't attack it?

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:50]** No, I weaken its mind and then I try to convince it to stop.

**[00:54:50 - 00:54:52]** I mean, we're going to kill it next turn anyway.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** Might as well try.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** Okay.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** Okay.

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:58]** That was your turn.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** Don't I roll to try to convince him or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:03]** I would say... What if he regenerates each round?

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:06]** What roll would that be?

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:08]** Diplomacy, I suppose.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:09]** Diplomacy, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** Give me a diplomacy roll.

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** It didn't succeed.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:15]** And give yourself a plus two because you're a Sheeran.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** Oh, it's a four.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** It didn't succeed.

**[00:55:18 - 00:55:19]** Four, yeah.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:21]** But maybe he'll care anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:25]** Maybe deep down it has a heart.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:27]** Maybe it does.

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:28]** Top of round three.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** Rick, what are you doing?

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:34]** You hear this plea of mercy from here, from across the room.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** I'm not pleading mercy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:36]** I'm offering him mercy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:40]** I rolled a 12 plus 5 plus 2.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:41]** On your diplomacy?

**[00:55:41 - 00:55:43]** No, on my attack roll.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:45]** 12 plus 5 plus 2.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:47]** 19 to hit.

**[00:55:47 - 00:55:49]** That is a hit.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:52]** He dropped his axe and it landed right next to this thing.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:56]** And then he just uses his axe to scoop it up and swing it at the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:59]** Nice.

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** That's fine.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:00]** Nice, yeah.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** How much damage do you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:03]** Like golfing.

**[00:56:03 - 00:56:04]** Enough damage to kill it.

**[00:56:04 - 00:56:05]** Like a nice backswing.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:06]** Boom.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:07]** Price is right, Bob.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:09]** Four points to kill it because I do at least five points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:15]** You do five points of damage because I'm going to say that as you swing it, you like cut into it and swing it against the wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Oh, I don't get to roll then?

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:17]** Because I get to roll.

**[00:56:17 - 00:56:18]** I do 1d12.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:25]** I was saying I have a plus 4, so if I roll a 1... Oh, then at least 5 points of damage.

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:28]** I did 11, so I did 15 points of damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:31]** 15 points of damage.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:32]** Well, it's dead.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** It's gone.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:34]** So much for that.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** As you said that...

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:41]** For a moment, its eyes are hopeful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_08

**[00:56:41 - 00:56:46]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:50]** They quiver at the idea that he's like Fred.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:51 - 00:57:00]** As Rick19 hits its one pincer, because the other one is cut off, it raises it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:00 - 00:57:05]** As Rick19 hits this thing solidly, it says, I love you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:18]** And then as it hits the wall, Rick19's axe cuts through its body, and the bottom half separates from the top half, and it is just left permanently with its arms out, stretched.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:18]** Towards here.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:19]** For love.

**[00:57:19 - 00:57:22]** And you killed the weaponized devil in a box.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** And that's our game.

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:27]** It's like, maybe.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:29]** Maybe.

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:32]** I'm not so bad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:33]** Life fleeting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:33 - 00:57:34]** Maybe.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** It could be fence.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:36]** Love.

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:37]** Love.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:44]** That's sad.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:48]** That toy.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:56]** As violent as it was, it brings back memories, especially this close to the holidays.

**[00:57:57 - 00:58:05]** I remember the very last Abadar day, when I could finally afford that plush doll that Tonam wanted.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:08]** I missed them so much.

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:13]** Zeish, Tonam, and my baby girl Babise.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:15]** I will find you.

**[00:58:17 - 00:58:18]** I will make it home to you someday.
