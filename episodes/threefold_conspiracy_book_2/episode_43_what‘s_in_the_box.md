## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:00:01 - 00:00:03]** Previously on Will Save.

**[00:00:04 - 00:00:09]** Misfortune reared its ugly head as our crew went toe-to-toe with the feral Grey Bounder.

**[00:00:10 - 00:00:17]** As the room started to cave in, the Bounder struck some decisive blows and our adventurers struggled to keep in the fight.

**[00:00:18 - 00:00:27]** Rick may have rolled, but it was the Bounder that decided to never give up on Nico after receiving a punishing onslaught of taunts.

**[00:00:27 - 00:00:36]** Hope now wears thin for our crew as the Bounder bears down on an already injured Nico Orion for an unrolled amount of damage.

**[00:00:37 - 00:00:40]** Will our crew live to say they'll never give up?

**[00:00:40 - 00:00:43]** Or will it be the Bounder singing never gonna say goodbye?

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:48]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:40 - 00:01:41]** I'm going to tell you guys something.

**[00:01:42 - 00:01:46]** I just thought I was going to tell you something I've never told anyone.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:01:47 - 00:01:49]** Secrets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:49]** What is it?

**[00:01:49 - 00:01:52]** What's up?

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:52]** Can I share it?

**[00:01:53 - 00:01:56]** Is it a peek behind the DM screen?

**[00:01:56 - 00:01:57]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:00]** He's going to tell us that he's always wanted to kill Nico and Ryan.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:01 - 00:02:02]** Well, we know this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:08]** Is it Starfighter related, or is it completely... No, it's not.

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:09]** Okay, what is it?

**[00:02:09 - 00:02:12]** I don't like cranberry sauce.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:15]** It's Thanksgiving this week, and I don't like it.

**[00:02:15 - 00:02:17]** I never have.

**[00:02:18 - 00:02:20]** Sorry, Mom, if you've been a faithful listener this whole time.

**[00:02:21 - 00:02:24]** But otherwise, I don't like it.

**[00:02:50 - 00:02:52]** Yeah, the yams are the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:54]** It's exciting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:54]** It's good.

**[00:02:57 - 00:03:01]** Does your mom home make the cranberry sauce that you have, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:04]** No, straight out of the can, man.

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:06]** It still has the can shape to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:07 - 00:03:08]** Yeah, dude.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:03:08 - 00:03:11]** It's not cut all the way, so it's just kind of ripples.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Yeah, they're ripples.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:14]** It's just half falling over.

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:15]** It's messed up.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:19]** I mean, if you like it, you like it, you know, but yeah.

**[00:03:20 - 00:03:22]** If anyone has a good family recipe, send it in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** I would always eat it separate.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** It was always like a dessert for me, though.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** I wouldn't eat it.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:27]** People put it on their turkeys and stuff.

**[00:03:27 - 00:03:28]** It's not a good combination, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:32]** Maybe back when people did turkey right, I guess it was a good thing.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:36]** Like during the 1600s when Thanksgiving started?

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:39]** Yeah, when like your peasants would come in and eat with you on your land.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:40]** Yeah.

**[00:03:40 - 00:03:43]** Well, that's actually way too, that's before the 1600s, but whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:47]** You're farming people on your land.

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:56]** John, I think your mom would say in the words of White Goodman, cram it up your hand, cram it up your cram hole, John.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** Stepbrothers 2008.

**[00:03:59 - 00:04:00]** Stepbrothers 2008.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** It's Dodgeball.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** It's Dodgeball.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** It's Stepbrothers.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:03]** White Goodman.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:05]** White Goodman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:06]** Cramming up your cram hole, LeFleur.

**[00:04:06 - 00:04:09]** Is that played by Ben Stiller?

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:11]** Yeah, that's Ben Stiller.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:12]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** Nico.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:14]** Cramming up your cram hole, John.

**[00:04:14 - 00:04:15]** Sorry, not Nico.

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Nick.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** Thanksgiving food.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:19]** Favorite or least favorite?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:20 - 00:04:20]** Drop it.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:22]** Favorite?

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:27]** Okay, so it's got to be my mom's mashed potatoes where she puts a little bit of white pepper in there.

**[00:04:27 - 00:04:29]** It just makes it really, really good.

**[00:04:31 - 00:04:34]** Then it's got to be stuffing.

**[00:04:34 - 00:05:01]** then turkey then trifle then I don't eat the cranberry sauce so I can't say one way or the other that whether or not I like it I just choose not to eat it because I just like the taste of whatever I'm having on the plate I think that's a default you don't like it so that's one for my team yeah you don't like it enough to not even try it yeah exactly so that's my order


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:02 - 00:05:02]** Nice.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:04]** That's my order.

**[00:05:04 - 00:05:05]** That's your order.

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:06]** Will.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:12]** Will, for everyone not watching, looks very pensive this whole time.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:15]** Like he's been considering a lot of different arguments here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:18]** No, I... He's letting it all boil inside of him about how much he hates Thanksgiving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:21]** I'm going to change the music because I feel like Will's going to be very serious here.

**[00:05:21 - 00:05:23]** I actually really like Thanksgiving.

**[00:05:23 - 00:05:24]** Oh, okay.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:36]** I'm very, I enjoy to cook, a good cook, cook out with family, friends, you know, gathering many people, celebrating with much merriment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:41]** And speaking of merriment, you know what Thanksgiving is also the first official day of, right?

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:55]** It is just about the universal, universally agreed upon day where people can start singing, if you believe in Christmas, start singing Christmas songs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:57]** Oh, yeah, sure.

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:57]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:57 - 00:05:58]** That's right.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:01]** Yeah, I'm kind of against people who put Christmas lights up before Thanksgiving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:02]** Exactly.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** So, I mean, here's kind of the debate is...

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** When is it okay to actually start singing Christmas songs?

**[00:06:08 - 00:06:12]** Is it the so quote unquote universally agreed upon Thanksgiving deadline?

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** Or is it December 1st?

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:17]** Is it after Halloween?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:19]** No, it's after Thanksgiving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:21]** John's like, it's June.

**[00:06:21 - 00:06:26]** If I go somewhere on Thanksgiving, if I go somewhere when I walk in, I want to hear All I Want for Christmas is You.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:27]** I want to hear it.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** It's a classic.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** That exact song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** That exact song.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:31]** I want to hear it every time.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:33]** Say you sent the bag something you might really need.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:36]** Would you please send my baby home to me?

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:43]** That was, remember, it was the all I want for Christmas, except I changed it to fax, because we were talking about faxing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:46]** That's right, because you're a chair salesman.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** I bungled that one.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:47]** That's right.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:48]** Yeah.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** Will, we didn't hear what your food was.

**[00:06:51 - 00:06:53]** You just took the sweet, neutral approach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:58]** Well, I like to cook a lot, so we do...

**[00:06:58 - 00:07:15]** you know, my, my favorite, like thing that I like to either bring to a friend's house or, uh, have always have on hand to share is, uh, green beans with like the, uh, mushroom sauce and the, uh, crispy fried onions.

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:18]** But I roast my vegetables and all that stuff.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:20]** And I do Brussels sprouts, of course.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:25]** Uh, sometimes we'll like sous vide lamb or do some Turkey, obviously.

**[00:07:25 - 00:07:26]** Uh,

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:27]** Sometimes even a ham.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:29]** Mushroom sauce is good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** And this has been Cooking with William Garrett.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:34]** Will's a good cook.

**[00:07:34 - 00:07:37]** Will's a great cook, but just the tone, the approach.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** He's so methodical about it.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:42]** The dedication to the art.

**[00:07:42 - 00:07:43]** He's a true craftsman.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:43 - 00:07:46]** We celebrate Thanksgiving.

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:49]** We celebrate Canadian Thanksgiving, which is celebrated a month ago.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** It's like a couple weeks, right?

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:54]** Canadian Thanksgiving is in October, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:54 - 00:08:00]** Is that like practice for American Thanksgiving?

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:00]** No.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:04]** Do you want to hear my theory on this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** I'm curious about the history.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:09]** I don't know if it's verified or not.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:12]** We have an hour, Will, so let's just go.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:15]** Let's skip Starfinder and learn all about Canadian Thanksgiving.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:23]** May historians wonder, my historical argument would be that Thanksgiving is celebrated in October.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:28]** Mainly in Canada, because their fall starts in October.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:32]** More so than in November in the United States.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:39]** I thought it was because of the exact same engagement that we... But also, there was a historical engagement that occurred.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:47]** And that could be a latitudinal case for that, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** The latitudinal case.

**[00:08:48 - 00:08:49]** That's correct.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:51]** Geography affecting history.

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:56]** So that encounter, you know, that is historical in Canada that represents their Thanksgiving.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:59]** It was delayed by nine months.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:59 - 00:08:59]** Yeah.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:06]** And so it actually took almost a year later for Canadians to learn what Thanksgiving was and start celebrating it.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:06]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** That's not what I was saying.

**[00:09:08 - 00:09:14]** Well, I mean, this is, you know, you're listening to us on American Thanksgiving.

**[00:09:15 - 00:09:19]** I feel like we missed Canadian Thanksgiving on the podcast.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:19]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:20]** We'll throw it down.

**[00:09:20 - 00:09:21]** We hope it was good.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:24]** I'm not a Canadian expert.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:25]** Kelly, are you ready for this?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:26]** What's up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:27]** I'll count us off.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:27]** Ready?

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:30]** One, two, three, four.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:36]** Oh, Canada.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:39]** Our home and native land.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** Bless the grains down in Canada.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:54]** The chilly, chilly, chilly grains.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:54]** I've been to Canada.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:58]** You've never been to Canada?

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** Will is offended.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** The greater Toronto area.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:02]** We have so many great Canadian listeners.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:04]** We have fantastic Canadian listeners.

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:06]** We have great Canadian listeners, though.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:06]** We do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:10]** Also, for my Thanksgiving, I like pies.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:31]** oh that's a good point a million pies and my mom like gets into pie you know how your mom's always get into like a cooking thing where they'll just cook the same thing for like months and they'll just like pile it up i don't know my mom does that and she'll just yeah my mom does that stuffing in my family my grandmother like would shred an entire chicken and put it inside of it including all the guts and like weird things so i've never been a fan of stuffing

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:37]** We talked about how conversation was a river, and I think I just vaulted us back off the river.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:45]** I think it was the original topic, so then I wanted to get back to it and not get... I was envisioning your mother shredding a chicken.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:48]** My grandmother, but yes, she probably would.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:49]** She eats everything.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:51]** I don't know if it's because she was a child of the depression or something.

**[00:10:51 - 00:10:52]** Who knows?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:55]** Haul us back and just say, I just want to once again thank our Canadian listeners.

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** Yeah, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:57 - 00:10:58]** You're fantastic.

**[00:10:58 - 00:11:01]** One day, we just might be going north.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:08]** I think we should go play and do perhaps a live show in Canada.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:09]** The week of Canadian Days.

**[00:11:09 - 00:11:10]** Get it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** We could do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:13]** Then I think we should just do that.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:20]** We should just go do a live show of us playing and then celebrate Canadian Thanksgiving that very week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:23]** I'll have to get my passport updated, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** You don't need one for Canada, I think.

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:25]** Yeah, you do.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:28]** Americans get special... Oh, I didn't need it last time I was there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** But maybe... When was the last time you went?

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:33]** Canada is not a street of United States.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:33 - 00:11:35]** No, no, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:35]** We do.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:36]** We do.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:41]** When you go to Canada, when you go to Canada, there's a section that says Canadian and U.S.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** residents.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:44]** Canadian and U.S.

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:48]** But no, Americans do get easier access to Canada like no one else does.

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:50]** You'll see when you try to get in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:50]** Yeah.

**[00:11:50 - 00:12:05]** I always joke that I wanted to buy some land somewhere and declare it sovereign and I would name it the country of Canada so that I could be the only true Canadian and everybody else would just be Canadians.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:10]** You could adopt some of their very northern areas where the polar bears might chill out.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:11]** No one lives there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:27]** There actually is a small piece of territory just south between the Sudan and Egypt that is technically unclaimed land and people can actually go claim it as sovereign territory.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:28]** Between what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:29]** Nobody's claimed it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** Why has nobody claimed it yet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:31]** It's probably horrible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:41]** It's because by claiming one of the pieces of land would sacrifice a claim on oil fields out in the ocean.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:43]** So nobody can claim what you're saying.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** We can't just go, oh, this is my land.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:47]** Yeah, literally it's just a bunch of dunes.

**[00:12:47 - 00:12:52]** But, I mean, you can go actually say this is my land and people have actually gone and done it before.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:58]** But in order for it to be actually internationally recognized by the UN, you need to be able to have a stable population.

**[00:12:58 - 00:13:02]** You need to be able to have an airport and have an embassy.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:05]** I thought that it was that you need a flag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:07]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** I think it's a part of that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:09]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:09 - 00:13:12]** Those could all be the same location.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:17]** We only support helicopters that land on my backyard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:37]** yeah yeah our airport's on the roof of my house yeah that's it only many helicopters can land there though yeah there are people that um go and form like ocean nations and stuff they're usually like libertarian paradises or they try to be i should say um have they started that oil rig thing

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:37]** Yeah.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:39]** Isn't it, like, Sealand?

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:40]** Sealand's also, like, technically a nation.

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Is there Sealand?

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:41]** That's a thing?

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:43]** There's a nation called Sealand, and it has, like, I don't know.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** Is it the floating islands?

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:46]** It's a real nation, sort of.

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:52]** No, it's, like, built on, like, an old oil rig or something, but you can actually become part of the gentry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Is that Sealand one word or two?

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:54]** I'm looking this up.

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:56]** I think it's the principality of Sealand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** Yeah, it's a thing, sort of.

**[00:13:59 - 00:13:59]** Kind of.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:01]** It's an unrecognized micro-nation.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:03]** Yeah, they're unrecognized because they don't have a flag.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:05]** But that's the closest they've gotten, is that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:05 - 00:14:07]** It's a Wikipedia entry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:13]** That's the closest I've gotten to an actual patient.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:15]** Speaking of Wikipedia, when are we going to get a We'll Save Wikipedia?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:16 - 00:14:19]** If anyone wants to write it that's listening, by all means.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:20 - 00:14:24]** If you're Canadian and you write it, thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:14:24 - 00:14:25]** We have a Reddit page.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:29]** That's kind of cool.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:30]** Yeah, we do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:34]** You know what our Wikipedia page would be called if we had a We'll Save Wikipedia?

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:38]** Wicca, Wicca, we'll save.

**[00:14:38 - 00:14:39]** Wicca, Wicca, we'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:42 - 00:14:42]** That's pretty good.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:50]** Well, speaking of libertarian principalities, you guys want to play some Starfinder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:52]** You're a libertarian principality.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:53]** Damn right.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** That's how I was raised.

**[00:14:55 - 00:14:55]** It's not true.

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:00]** We'll save where you get your Starfinder politics and your Starfinder recipes.

**[00:15:00 - 00:15:02]** You learn so much at We'll Save.

**[00:15:02 - 00:15:03]** You learn so much.

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:05]** We're gonna, we're gonna, we'll save.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:07]** It doesn't.

**[00:15:09 - 00:15:14]** doesn't flow as well as from Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:15 - 00:15:21]** You know what it's kind of like?

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** It's kind of like the Guinness guys.

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:25]** Who's just going like, that's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:28]** I haven't seen that, but no.

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:28]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:33]** Well, I think it's important to just recognize the bounder in the room here.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** And that's that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:34 - 00:15:36]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:38]** Well played.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:38]** Well played.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:42]** Nick is... If GM got punishments, I'd give you that.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:44]** No punishments for the GM.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:47]** Yeah, if GM's got punishments, we'd give you that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:47 - 00:15:48]** Okay, let's vote on this.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** I vote no.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:50]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:52]** I don't want you having punishments.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:54]** I don't want you having punishments.

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:55]** It's scary.

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:57]** Enemies are tough enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:58 - 00:16:02]** Will, you didn't vote, but... Yeah.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:02]** What?

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:03]** What am I voting on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:03 - 00:16:06]** You seem to be punished.

**[00:16:06 - 00:16:08]** I think John's trying to trick us into letting him get punishments.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:08 - 00:16:09]** Yeah.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** Punishments.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** No.

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:14]** Go ahead.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:14]** Roll it.

**[00:16:14 - 00:16:15]** Just roll it.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:25]** Well, let's just remind the listeners that Nico did some pretty aggressive things through this great boundary last time, including spitting blood.

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:28]** You all did a number of things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:30 - 00:16:32]** I love how John's characterizing this right now.

**[00:16:32 - 00:16:39]** It's like, okay, we all know Nico did some very aggressive things, and that's why he's going to die.

**[00:16:40 - 00:16:44]** Justifying this right now, he spat blood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:44 - 00:17:12]** blood he did this let's also acknowledge everyone else who did their part so doctor okay some damage right pretty sure here's it's a magic missile damage he did and then that's it so a grenade at it I was like two episodes ago people have been abused by Nico Ryan I picture the gray like taking one swipe and going just like liability


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:17]** It's in your brain.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** He gains the encumbered condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:23]** Yeah, Will, it has the encumbered condition.

**[00:17:23 - 00:17:26]** I had met from two episodes ago, but I think it was the shaken condition.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:28]** And he's also shaken too now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:28 - 00:17:31]** He's shaken now too, yep.

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:35]** But I believe that that was even with a minus two to the attack roll.

**[00:17:35 - 00:17:36]** That still hits you because it was a 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:40]** Yeah, because you have an unreal freaking damage modifier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:40 - 00:17:44]** You rolled a 29 and our KACs are like 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:44 - 00:17:49]** The whole point is that Nico only has 13 HP left.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:49 - 00:17:51]** I feel like the books are being cooked on this one.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** Nope.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:53]** I have 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:53 - 00:17:56]** I thought you had 13.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:57]** I have 11.

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:59]** So wait, hold on.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:00]** Let me double check this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:02]** Yeah, let's double check this because we ended the last time with you saying 13.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:03]** Correct.

**[00:18:03 - 00:18:04]** It's 13.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:08]** And of course, somebody who cooks the books would argue that I'm cooking the books, but I'm not cooking the books.

**[00:18:08 - 00:18:10]** You are anything about this monster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** I think this book is already cooked.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:13]** I think you bought it straight out of the oven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:32]** yep so if i roll jokes if i roll thank you i can't tell if will is happy or sad uh i mean that i'm that this could happen i'm concerned for nico


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:36]** I think we all are.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:38]** But we do know that you have a plus seven.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:39]** It's a plus seven.

**[00:18:39 - 00:18:40]** I told you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:42]** I said a 1d6 plus seven.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:45]** So if you roll a six, that'll knock Nico out.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:49]** So he still gets a couple rounds to survive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:51]** He could spend a resolve point.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:51]** Yep.

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:52]** But then what if you guys miss?

**[00:18:53 - 00:18:54]** And then I don't know.

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:54]** What could happen?

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:55]** What could happen?

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:57]** All right.

**[00:18:58 - 00:18:59]** There we go, Nico.

**[00:19:01 - 00:19:02]** Gonna roll this Kraken die.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:04]** Kraken D6.

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** Dark.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Dark Galaxy.

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:12]** I rolled a two.

**[00:19:13 - 00:19:16]** So that's nine points of damage to Nico.

**[00:19:17 - 00:19:20]** Bringing you close to death.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** Rough, rough, rough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:32]** Niko getting stabbed again, more blood's going to come out of his mouth, and he's just going to spit it right back at this creature again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:33 - 00:19:39]** You're immune to the psychic terror, so you just spit blood as this thing bites into your side.

**[00:19:39 - 00:19:40]** Is that the best you could do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:44]** He's going to be like, is that the best you could do?

**[00:19:44 - 00:19:45]** You great freak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:47 - 00:19:49]** Why is he immune?

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:52]** Because he succeeded on the save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:55]** Oh, so if you succeed once, you don't have to roll it ever again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:55]** Yeah.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:56]** Ever again.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** For an hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:57]** For an hour.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:58]** For an hour.

**[00:19:58 - 00:19:59]** For an hour.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:59 - 00:20:00]** For an hour.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:01]** Rick19, it's your turn.

**[00:20:02 - 00:20:06]** What are you thinking as you saw Nico is close to death?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:07]** There's no thoughts.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:11]** He's just, like, reacting, and he's just going to swing his axe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:11 - 00:20:12]** Pure machine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:12 - 00:20:14]** Swing again.

**[00:20:14 - 00:20:17]** This thing is close to death.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:26]** I rolled a 5 plus 5 to hit for a total of 10, and this thing has a KAC of like 47, so... No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:30]** You were close, but no, you missed.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:33]** Maybe you swung right as it leapt at Nico.

**[00:20:33 - 00:20:35]** So it bing hits the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:35 - 00:20:43]** Yo, like, Kev, seriously, can you go, like, find something to give you, like, some good luck for, like, because you've been rolling just awful.

**[00:20:43 - 00:20:44]** I've switched three different dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:47]** Like, this is, I just.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:50]** Do you want to, like, throw some salt over your shoulder?

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** I know, right?

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:55]** Or, like, go buy, like, some, like, chicken wings and get a wishbone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** It's because you didn't have that rabbit's foot.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:57]** Dr.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:59]** O.K., you could do this.

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:00]** Unless you want to do anything else with your turn, Rick.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:01]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:03]** could end this.

**[00:21:03 - 00:21:05]** You can make this all go away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:06]** Okay.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** I'm going to...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:10 - 00:21:11]** Actually, wait.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:17]** I am going to spend my move action, I'm going to take a guarded step behind this thing.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** Smart.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** Now it's flanked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Now it's flanked.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:22]** Just reminded.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:22 - 00:21:37]** Seeing this, seeing Rick, I'll nod to him and pull from my hindquarters, so to speak, my tactical syringe spear.

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:38]** Okay.

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:56]** go and just hit him with a uh my i have well you were holding your vapor cavitation pistol i thought and then yeah i can put that away uh and that's my suspended move action i suppose right yeah

**[00:21:57 - 00:21:59]** and then pull out this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:03]** You can also drop it, because I think to do that and then to pull it out would be your turn.

**[00:22:04 - 00:22:04]** Right, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:07]** Yeah, you technically drop your gun.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:07 - 00:22:08]** I'll drop it then.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:10]** Okay.

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:10]** It goes off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:13]** Sheeting itself is a move action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:13]** Yeah.

**[00:22:13 - 00:22:15]** Yeah.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:15]** Yeah.

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:16]** Okay.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:17]** So you pull out the spear.

**[00:22:18 - 00:22:19]** This is your moment.

**[00:22:19 - 00:22:20]** You could do this.

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:21]** Yeah.

**[00:22:21 - 00:22:22]** This gray bounder is now flanked.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** You get a plus two to your roll.

**[00:22:24 - 00:22:27]** And the AC is already lowered because you encumbered it.

**[00:22:28 - 00:22:29]** Oh, we're getting the die cam here.

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:31]** What'd you roll?

**[00:22:31 - 00:22:33]** 19 on the die.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:35]** Dang, that's a hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** There we go.

**[00:22:36 - 00:22:37]** Wow.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** You got to roll the mischance, though.

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:39]** No.


## Speaker_0

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:39]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:39 - 00:22:40]** 22.

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:43]** Oh, you just got a mischance.

**[00:22:44 - 00:22:45]** No, no, no.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:46]** I didn't roll the 22.

**[00:22:46 - 00:22:48]** That's not what I rolled.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:50]** I'm just saying the 22 hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:50 - 00:22:51]** Roll the mischance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:54]** D20, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:55]** No, it's a D100.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:57]** So we're taking two dice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:22:57 - 00:23:00]** 90.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:02]** Oh, you're good.

**[00:23:02 - 00:23:02]** You're weak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:06]** The spear, it just sinks in.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:16]** There's almost no pushback in the body as the spear cuts through into the body of the creature.

**[00:23:16 - 00:23:17]** How much damage you do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:20]** Big damage, hopefully.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:22]** Okay, okay, okay.

**[00:23:22 - 00:23:24]** Eight piercing damage.

**[00:23:25 - 00:23:26]** That's got to be it, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:28]** Yep, that's got to be it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:32]** You stab the Grey Bounder.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:36]** You hear one last...

**[00:23:37 - 00:23:42]** That fades in your head as the creature falls and dies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:43 - 00:23:43]** Yes.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:44]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** Wow.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:46]** Wow.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:49]** That was a three episode long combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:50]** That was.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:50 - 00:23:52]** That was a tough combat.

**[00:23:52 - 00:23:53]** That might have been your toughest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:56]** And that's not including the other time we fought this thing already.

**[00:23:57 - 00:23:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:58 - 00:23:58]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:58 - 00:24:00]** Good riddance.

**[00:24:00 - 00:24:01]** Good riddance.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:02]** Creepy gray dog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:02 - 00:24:05]** Your dog is eating an avocado.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:05 - 00:24:06]** Not anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:07 - 00:24:08]** Not anymore.

**[00:24:08 - 00:24:09]** Not anymore.

**[00:24:09 - 00:24:10]** Not anymore.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:12]** So this creature falls.

**[00:24:13 - 00:24:16]** The tail limp falls to the ground.

**[00:24:16 - 00:24:20]** You can see that this tail is incredibly sharp.

**[00:24:20 - 00:24:23]** Just running your finger on it would cut you instantly.

**[00:24:23 - 00:24:30]** This incredibly feral creature designed to move, attack, and take you out quickly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:38]** Niko wants to know, asking the GM here, can I cut off the end of this thing's tail and use it as a tactical knife?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:40]** I literally knew you were going to ask that.

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:46]** So much so that I was thinking of doing it because you inspired us in the past to do weird shit like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:52]** Anyway, go for it.

**[00:24:53 - 00:24:56]** Can I cut off the end of this thing's tail and use it as a tactical knife?

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:06]** That you could, but if you did not use any sort of preservation method on it, I think there's a finite time lag that you can use it.

**[00:25:06 - 00:25:08]** Ross is going to start today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:08]** Okay, never mind.

**[00:25:08 - 00:25:09]** Not worth it.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:10]** Not worth it, though.

**[00:25:10 - 00:25:11]** It would be pretty badass.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:13]** Oh, Nick will just do it as a trophy.

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:15]** He'll just cut off the end of this thing as a trophy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:18]** Excuse me a moment.

**[00:25:18 - 00:25:29]** I'm going to pick up the transmutation matrix and use the survival knife to slice him open.

**[00:25:30 - 00:25:31]** I want to examine him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:32]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:33]** Ah, there you go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:38]** Yeah, and then, Nico, also think about how that plays out role-playing if you cut it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:38 - 00:25:39]** Absolutely, absolutely.

**[00:25:40 - 00:25:42]** Hold on.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:44]** What's the name of the...

**[00:25:44 - 00:25:46]** Oh, never mind.

**[00:25:46 - 00:25:46]** I got it.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:51]** So Nico kind of says last time, getting ready to cut off the end of this thing's tail, he's calling out to everybody.

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:59]** Last time at a game this, this challenging, was when I was hunting with my dad on Castorville.

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:08]** And he takes his dueling sword after... He takes his... He puts his... He sheathes his...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:29]** his blaster pistol for a second and cuts off the end of the sink's tail it's like i'm keeping this and whenever i get home i'm mounting this in my wall actually i don't think i can do that never mind this is you all i mean look there have been a handful of tough combats this is definitely one that was frustrating and tough and you guys might have died could have happened


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:32]** Yeah, both of our toughest combats was with this creature.

**[00:26:33 - 00:26:35]** We should taxidermy it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:44]** We should use it for whatever checks, intimidation checks.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:45]** Not really.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:47]** You should heal up.

**[00:26:47 - 00:26:49]** What are you guys thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:51]** Walk around with the head on a chair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:53]** Accidentally stab yourself and then you're dead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** I'm going to go ahead.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:56]** Can we do like a five-minute rest here?

**[00:26:57 - 00:26:59]** I'll just burn a result point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:59 - 00:27:00]** It's a 10-minute rest.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:01]** It's a 10-minute rest.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:01 - 00:27:02]** It's a 10-minute rest.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:03]** Yeah, I'll do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** I think we need to get out of this room.

**[00:27:05 - 00:27:07]** So let's just think about this.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:10]** What are you thinking and what are you going to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** What was Dr. O.K.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** going to do and he said he can't now?

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:13]** Why?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:44]** i was saying that uh take the survival knife from the vapor cavitation pistol like turn it back into it but i don't think it doesn't it take 10 minutes to do that and also i don't actually think i would gain anything from hold on i got a crazy idea john i don't will this work i don't want to take any time dr k is talking there call i'm sorry um we should get out of here this room is collapsing isn't it still can i do a perception check


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:44 - 00:28:04]** sure 18 on a dime plus 12 30 yeah you're confident that no more the ceiling is not going to cave in any further nice but if you want to look in you can see what has happened so far um here's my question for the gm


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:05]** Could Dr. O.K.

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:11]** take his transmorphic pistol and scan the knife?

**[00:28:12 - 00:28:19]** And if he did, would that knife that he scanned have those same, like, horror effects?

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** Debuffs, potentially.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:21]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** That would have been cool.

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:25]** That would have been real cool.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:29]** I think you would need to do more than... I'm thinking the thing's poison, right?

**[00:28:29 - 00:28:31]** That there is poison at the end of the tail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:33]** It sounds like a fear poison.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** No, there's no poison.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:36]** It's a psychic effect from the creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:37]** Okay.

**[00:28:37 - 00:28:38]** It was any hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:39 - 00:28:40]** Any hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:40 - 00:28:42]** That would have been cool if we could have done that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:45]** I super agree that would have been really cool.

**[00:28:45 - 00:28:46]** Not saying you can't do that again in the future.

**[00:28:47 - 00:28:54]** Also, if you want to make a case for trying to take the brain and the... It's like... I'm not going to say no to cool stuff.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:59]** I just think just taking it by itself because it's a poison and using the transmutation matrix.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** If Dr. O.K.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:03]** as the biological expert wants to try it, that's his call.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:03 - 00:29:05]** I don't think it works like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** I don't think it works like that either.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:08 - 00:29:10]** Unless it's a genetic thing.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** Maybe it's like being knowledge.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:16]** Could I do, like, a theme knowledge check on the alien's corpse?

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** On the gray?

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:18]** Sure.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** Give me a life science.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:26]** Well, no, it's... I don't even think it's, like, a... Under a profession?

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** Yeah.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** Is it a profession?

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:40]** If you're an expert in one particular field of study and your passion for the subject shows, choose... It's a life science check, but, like, recall knowledge about your... What is your profession?

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:41]** Five...

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:57]** yeah i think i just get like an insight bonus so i'll just roll my regular life science okay what is your profession though genetics genetics okay 32 19 and that's to see if you can do it well yeah


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:01]** I mean, that's a really great role.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:03]** I think you plan it out in your head.

**[00:30:04 - 00:30:17]** You see the steps that it would take to create a psychic ability from a creature's brain and then apply it to a weapon, like a weapon fusion or something.

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:21]** And I think if you wanted to try and take the creature's brain to do this at a future date, you could.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:24]** But I think you would need more than just your kit that you have now.

**[00:30:25 - 00:30:27]** You would probably need a dedicated space.

**[00:30:27 - 00:30:30]** But you could take it and ask somebody to do it.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:31]** You could take it and see.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:37]** Or maybe there are other places here where you could try and do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:38]** If you want to take that time.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:40]** I have nothing to preserve this alien though.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:41]** Uh, gray.

**[00:30:41 - 00:30:53]** And I feel it's more beast than anything else, but perhaps if, uh, I guess I could take a piece of his brain or something, his head.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:54]** Sure.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** You, you want to do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:57]** Sure.

**[00:30:58 - 00:31:06]** As you cut into the head again, it, this is probably one of the few times that, uh,

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:26]** there is any you know i don't know that there's any medical study done on grace so few and far between maybe somewhere in the infosphere in some dark corner there's literature about it you can find out completely mutilated this dead corpse by the way

**[00:31:26 - 00:31:31]** But now that you cut in, you realize that the flesh feels like rubber.

**[00:31:31 - 00:31:33]** Again, as you push in, it feels like neoprene.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:38]** It depresses, and then it slices through very easily.

**[00:31:38 - 00:31:44]** And part of the skin fills in with black fluid, but then not that much.

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:47]** It's almost as if the veins are not quite connected to the body.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** It's very weird.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** But as you cut in...

**[00:31:50 - 00:32:10]** this is so gross pull open the skull you are able to see the brain and you're just able to move past a bone right where you cut in and you can carve out a core of the brain

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:12]** And put it in your kit.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:15]** The brain is also gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:15]** Curious question.

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:17]** That's some gray matter.

**[00:32:17 - 00:32:21]** This thing didn't... It's gray.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:22]** Gray matter to the brain.

**[00:32:23 - 00:32:27]** Anyways, this thing's neck didn't explode like the others, right?

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:27]** It did not.

**[00:32:27 - 00:32:29]** Does it have explosions in it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:32:30 - 00:32:36]** I'm going to say with your life science check, Dr. K, that you... And as you're looking at the brain, you're thinking about creatures of this size.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:42]** The muscular buildup of creatures like this.

**[00:32:42 - 00:32:44]** And knowing all the creatures in the packed worlds and beyond.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:45]** All the creatures.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:46]** All of them.

**[00:32:46 - 00:32:47]** Just like a Pokedex.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:50]** You know all of them.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:56]** You are fairly confident that this creature is smart enough...

**[00:32:56 - 00:33:09]** To be a watchdog, not smart enough to put a bomb in its head, carry a conversation, retain enough information, can carry out some pretty complex orders and do its task.

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:10]** Yeah.

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:11]** But that is what it's meant to do.


## Speaker_0

**[00:33:11 - 00:33:12]** Soldier.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** It's a soldier.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** It's a watchdog.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** It carries out simple commands.

**[00:33:16 - 00:33:23]** Can think critically enough to make somewhat complex decisions, but is not going to retain information.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:23 - 00:33:27]** You mentioned it was a mind... What was he producing?

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:28]** A psychic effect?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:29]** It was a terror.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:35]** Psychic terror, which is a mind-affecting emotion and fear effect.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:39]** It infects you with psychic fear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:39]** Dr.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:45]** O.K., can you check to see if there is an explosive device planted in this thing's head?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:48]** Uh, wasn't it near the neck?

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:49]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** I'll take a look.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:55]** Give me a... I'd probably, you know, I guess a medicine check.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** I'll assist on that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:03]** Oh, yeah, 19 plus... Four, or five, so 24.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:05]** Yeah, I got a 20.

**[00:34:05 - 00:34:05]** So 22.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:09]** Plus whatever Kev gives me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:09 - 00:34:10]** Yeah, so 22 total.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Doesn't look like there is one.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:29]** In the area that you remember, you're carefully carving through the base of the spine to see and right at the back of the head to see if something's there, hoping you don't stab it and you don't find anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:51]** peeling it's very curious that this thing is not armed with an explosive device but the sentient one next door was it's uh it's a little uh it's a little uh i think uh less intelligent gray dog like thing yes more beast than probably doesn't have anything to protect


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:53]** Nico's just going to rack his brains.

**[00:34:53 - 00:34:59]** He wants to do a culture check and see what he remembers from stories of advanced weaponry.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:01]** Because that would fall under his profession.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:05]** Wait, what about advanced weaponry?

**[00:35:05 - 00:35:06]** Advanced weaponry in relation to what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:08]** That this creature is a weapon?

**[00:35:09 - 00:35:10]** Yeah, that this creature might be a weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:11 - 00:35:13]** It's more like a dog than it is a weapon.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:19]** But what if it used to be a grey that was mutated into something more of a dog?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:20]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:21 - 00:35:24]** Maybe that's something Dr. O'Keefe or anybody with life science or physical science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:25]** I think it's just a feral gray.

**[00:35:25 - 00:35:28]** If the grays are left alone too long, they turn into this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:30 - 00:35:39]** If that was the case, why wasn't the... Now that's an avocado-eating dog.

**[00:35:41 - 00:35:46]** If that was the case, why wasn't the one doing experiments was clearly left on his own for a long time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** I was joking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:49]** Oh, okay.

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:54]** So if you want to do that, I'm going to say somebody should give Nico an aid.

**[00:35:54 - 00:35:55]** I will.

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** It's life science, right?

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:58]** I would think it would be life science.

**[00:35:59 - 00:35:59]** Okay.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:00]** Unless you just wanted to see.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:03]** So if you just want to see what information.

**[00:36:03 - 00:36:04]** You said culture check, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:06]** Well, it's a profession.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:09]** It's a profession check in this case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:11]** So how would I aid with that?

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:15]** If you just want to see what knowledge, you know, it's culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:17]** Oh, it wouldn't be profession.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:21]** If you want to see if this creature was made to be a weapon, it could be profession.

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:22]** Okay.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:28]** If you want to know anything more about what the creature, you know, how it came about, it would not be profession.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:29]** Oh, then I'll just do culture.

**[00:36:30 - 00:36:31]** I'll just do culture then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:34]** So culture would be trying to think, did you see it?

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:34]** Did you read it?

**[00:36:34 - 00:36:35]** Have you heard anything about this?

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:40]** Life science would be looking at the body to see what, what science in the body.

**[00:36:40 - 00:36:41]** Tell me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:41 - 00:36:41]** Yep.

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:45]** That's going to be a 20, 11 plus 9.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:48]** Here's a 6.

**[00:36:48 - 00:36:50]** Sorry, that's going to be a 21, 11 plus 10.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** I have a 10 culture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:54]** Here's a 6 for a total of 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:55 - 00:36:57]** Okay.

**[00:36:57 - 00:36:58]** Don't let me forget, guys.

**[00:36:58 - 00:37:03]** My survival is pretty high, so next time we run into a wild animal, I can try to talk to it.

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Not talk to it, but work with it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:06 - 00:37:07]** See if we can tame it.

**[00:37:07 - 00:37:09]** We should have kept it.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** We should have kept the wave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:14]** Roll for animal handling every single turn.

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:14]** Every time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** It's survival, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:38]** wolves i'm picturing that here's did you ate on this culture check or no was it just yeah i did so it's total 23 yeah oh yeah 23 i did okay good enough that i'm gonna say this nico maybe one time you think you might have recalled this

**[00:37:38 - 00:38:08]** some random port you're in somebody that you're talking to late at a bar person you talk to and they seem cool and then after a while they start saying things you're just like i don't i don't know what you're talking about that's weird i should not have bought you a drink and nico maybe you were at your company one day and there's just you were walking by and somebody this is what you think maybe you overheard just random chit chat among employees water cooler talk

**[00:38:10 - 00:38:23]** You think that if this creature were a weapon, it's probably the case that it's a different species than a gray.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:35]** Maybe there are some things that might have been augmented in the course of domestication or any sort of controlling or breeding.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:39]** But for the most part, they're probably domesticated.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:42]** That's your guess.

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:43]** And again, this is just hearsay.

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:53]** This is you from some dude who's really into conspiracy theorists or some person who's really into conspiracies saying, you know, I bet there's something else out there besides grace.

**[00:38:53 - 00:39:03]** I bet there's some sort of, you know, I read, I saw in this video that they have these creatures that they can send out to do their guarding and their bidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:06]** So Nico's going to relay this to the rest of the team.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:10]** He's going to be like, you know, one time I was at a port call and

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:19]** You know, I heard some drunken moron over there talking about greys and extra greys.

**[00:39:19 - 00:39:23]** He referred to them as the four-legged extras.

**[00:39:25 - 00:39:40]** And he seemed pretty confident that these things were just... They bred these things for the specific purpose of using them as dogs or weapons like dogs.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:47]** But they are a separate species all on their own, just as Dr. Okay was mentioning earlier.

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:51]** So, I mean, it's interesting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:51 - 00:39:57]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** That's okay, Dr. Okay.

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** That's very interesting.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:01]** I like it.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:06]** So, Nico's then going to look over at Dr. Okay and like, it's been a long day.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:07]** Trust me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:09 - 00:40:11]** Nico in here is, give me a

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:14]** Give me, give me a wisdom check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:16]** Give me a wisdom check.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:19]** That's an 11.

**[00:40:19 - 00:40:20]** Oh my God.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** It's a seven.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:23]** 11 and seven.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:23]** All right.

**[00:40:24 - 00:40:30]** You're not really quite, you think about that memory and you're like, and then that's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:36]** Well, here's knowing that he doesn't know, maybe might do a life science check if that further expands our knowledge.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:36]** No.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:37]** Would that?

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:37]** No.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:38]** Good.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:38]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:40 - 00:40:41]** So what do you guys want to do?

**[00:40:42 - 00:40:44]** Here's Tell's Niko.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:46]** You should probably patch yourself up.

**[00:40:47 - 00:40:48]** Doc, you got anything for him?

**[00:40:49 - 00:40:49]** You got anything?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:51]** Yes.

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:53]** Do you want me to roll?

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:56]** I'll just hit him.

**[00:40:56 - 00:41:00]** I have one of the Mark I healing serums.

**[00:41:01 - 00:41:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** Does anybody else need healing?

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:07]** Niko's going to cough up a little bit more blood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** Onto the body of the gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:09 - 00:41:39]** whatever's left of it and he will spit a piece of and then he's gonna be like yeah doc i think i could use this thing stabbed me a couple times here i'm i'm kind of losing a little bit bloodier i shouldn't be worried about lightheadedness should i uh you get four hit do you are you down on hit points yeah i have four from death i was four hit points away from death okay so you get four hit points back

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:42]** Thank you, Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:44]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:44 - 00:41:45]** Rick moves into the other room.

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:45]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:46 - 00:41:48]** And Nico's going to say, hold up, guys.

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:52]** Why don't you guys go on ahead and take a look at a couple things around here.

**[00:41:52 - 00:41:57]** I'm going to take ten minutes here just to kind of collect myself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:00]** All right.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** So Nico takes a ten-minute rest.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:06]** Does everyone else take a ten-minute rest to regain your stamina?

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:06]** What is that?

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** Or do you look around?

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:08]** I'm going to look up again.

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:14]** I'm going to say that if somebody wants to rest and other people don't, I'll allow that and other people can do checks instead of resting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:17]** Ten minute rest gives you all your stamina back, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:17]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:19]** I'm going to wait.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:21]** Yeah, I'll do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:21 - 00:42:22]** Okay, so you all take a ten minute rest.

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** During that time... I said I'll wait.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:27]** Oh, sorry.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** I will save my ten minute rest.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:31]** So here's Dr. Okay and Nico.

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:37]** You're still sitting in this entryway between the data foundry and this room.

**[00:42:38 - 00:43:00]** rick you go in uh let me i'll just rest around the carcass of this grave so i regain all my biohacks yeah as nico's kind of sitting down and resting he's just kind of like absently stabbing this dead beast with his dueling sword let me read you a little bit more again rick you're walking around you're doing a perception check what are you doing


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:43:01 - 00:43:05]** Yeah, so Rick steps, he opens up the door and he steps, you know, fully.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:05]** Okay.

**[00:43:05 - 00:43:10]** And then he steps through it about where he was the last time he stepped into this room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:10 - 00:43:13]** Okay, let me read you again just so you get a sense of it.

**[00:43:14 - 00:43:27]** There's still the sense of fracture and complete, you know, disrepair as if this room is very damaged.

**[00:43:28 - 00:43:29]** It's roughly octagonal.

**[00:43:29 - 00:43:33]** There are still these cracks running through the stone ceiling, the floor.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:53]** Up in the northern part of this octagonal room, where there was this machine with smoky crystal anchors, gold, silver wires, very tightly organized together, there is now a large boulder that has broken most of the machine.

**[00:43:53 - 00:43:57]** Clearly, it was working when you were here last time, and as a result of the grenade, it is not.

**[00:43:58 - 00:44:03]** There's another boulder off to the right that you... It didn't hit anything.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:04]** It just fell on the floor.

**[00:44:04 - 00:44:09]** There is a workstation that is right in front of you.

**[00:44:10 - 00:44:12]** Dr. K now is standing there.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:21]** And Rick, you see that at the workstation, the chair and the desk are smashed.

**[00:44:23 - 00:44:28]** And you can see a small humanoid form is crumpled among the wreckage.

**[00:44:31 - 00:44:34]** Just so you guys know, I know some of you on Roll20 have moved in.

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:40]** I'm going to give Rick the first kind of, you know, go of the room because he walked in before you guys came in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:43]** You guys are resting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:45]** Actually, I decided not to do that.

**[00:44:45 - 00:44:47]** It's not worth it for me.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:47]** Okay.

**[00:44:47 - 00:44:50]** Don't want to spend a resolve point on, like, a couple stamina.

**[00:44:50 - 00:44:50]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:51 - 00:44:55]** So do I need to do a general perception on the room or that kind of was...

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:57]** I think we already did before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:57 - 00:44:58]** Yeah, that's just a general thing.

**[00:44:58 - 00:45:02]** But if you want to investigate anything, if you want to go move stuff, if you want to look into it, we can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:04]** I'll step over kind of towards the desk.

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:07]** Is it only Nico that needs to rest?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:09]** Are we actually just pushing forward?

**[00:45:09 - 00:45:12]** I thought that you were resting.

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:12]** I don't need to.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:14]** Okay.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:14]** Same.

**[00:45:14 - 00:45:15]** I'm waiting for Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:15 - 00:45:16]** That's it.

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:19]** Okay, so who is in the room looking around?

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** The three of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:21]** It's fine.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:22]** Nico, take your 10.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** You're fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:23]** That's fine.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:25]** I'm just trying to see who's doing what.

**[00:45:25 - 00:45:26]** Okay, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:34]** So I rolled a 15 plus 6 for 21 on perception of, I guess, the body and the computer.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:35]** Can I do that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:39]** Or do I need to do two?

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** Well, which one do you want to do?

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:44]** Tell me what you want to look at, and I'll tell you what to roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:46]** Well, I guess Dr. Oki is over by the body anyways.

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** He's going to inspect it.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:50]** I'm sure there's going to be the heads exploded or something silly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:50 - 00:45:51]** Do you want to do a life science check, Dr. Oki?

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:52]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** I'm going to do a perception on the computer then.

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:59]** Give me... I rolled a 21 for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:59 - 00:46:01]** I was going to say do an engineering instead of perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:06]** Perception or engineering or what?

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** For Rick19.

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:10]** For Dr. K, if you're going to look at the body, do a life science or a medicine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:10 - 00:46:12]** Wasted my roll.

**[00:46:12 - 00:46:13]** I rolled a one plus three.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:13 - 00:46:17]** Well, I'll say that whatever you were rolled for the perception, just add your engineering bonus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:17]** 30.

**[00:46:17 - 00:46:18]** Oh, okay.

**[00:46:18 - 00:46:19]** So it was 18 for engineering then.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:19 - 00:46:20]** 18 for engineering.

**[00:46:20 - 00:46:21]** Dr. K.

**[00:46:21 - 00:46:22]** 17 on the die.

**[00:46:22 - 00:46:24]** 13 on life science.

**[00:46:24 - 00:46:25]** Okay.

**[00:46:25 - 00:46:26]** You got a 30 on life science.

**[00:46:26 - 00:46:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:46:29 - 00:46:29]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:31 - 00:46:44]** Now, Dr. O'Kay, you can tell that this gray, as you walk over, and Rick, you don't see it maybe because you walk around the north side of the Spast workstation.

**[00:46:45 - 00:46:48]** Dr. O'Kay sees it as he walks around the south side.

**[00:46:48 - 00:46:56]** The creature, the lower half that you could see on the southern part of the room, Dr. O'Kay, is the head creature.

**[00:46:57 - 00:46:58]** And you do notice the head.

**[00:46:58 - 00:47:00]** Yeah, there's a hole in the back.

**[00:47:01 - 00:47:09]** As you now know from looking at the gray bounder, the gray skin is different than maybe other species.

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** And it seems like it's thinner.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** There's less protection.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:15]** And that's why some of these bombs, there's a huge hole.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:24]** But the concerning thing is that the creature didn't just get hit with this bomb.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:30]** The upper torso is disconnected from the lower torso.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:34]** And as you maybe move it a little bit, you realize one of his arms is ripped off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:36 - 00:47:37]** What the f***?

**[00:47:37 - 00:47:37]** I'll say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:39]** Of his graybounder.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:54]** So, as you're trying to see what's going on, Rick19, you look and you realize this workstation, you look at the ceiling, you look at where the rocks fell.

**[00:47:56 - 00:48:00]** And you think this workstation was not smashed by the environment.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** Something might have smashed the workstation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:32]** um can i mean is it apparent that because is there like slashes or anything is it something equivalent to what this boundary could do or is it something separate survival check yeah so between the two of you give me a survival and a life science check i know that you guys have different specialties so whichever way you want to do it wait so one at a time rick you're gonna do nine for survival


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** And Dr. O'Keefe, you're going to do?

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:36]** 18 life science.

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** 9 for survival, 18 for life science.

**[00:48:39 - 00:48:41]** Yeah, you don't know.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:47]** Can you do a take 20 on a survival or a life science?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:48]** I'd have to look.

**[00:48:49 - 00:48:50]** I think for survival you can.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:51]** I probably could.

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:55]** I mean, you could roll it into the 10 minutes if you guys want to do that.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** I won't say no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:59]** Survival is untrained.

**[00:48:59 - 00:49:02]** I can automatically succeed at any attempt to aid it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:03 - 00:49:04]** I'm going to say that you can.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:05]** Pretty sure that you can.

**[00:49:06 - 00:49:07]** I don't see why you can't.

**[00:49:08 - 00:49:09]** Do you want to take 20?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:09 - 00:49:11]** Sorry, I'm still reading the rules on take 20.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:12]** I've never used it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:12 - 00:49:16]** There is something that I can automatically succeed to.

**[00:49:16 - 00:49:20]** There's some uncertain knowledge checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:21]** A lot of page turning here.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:25]** Is it enough page turning that I should see what Hears wants to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:29]** I'm at survival now.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:31]** Wait, were you segwaying into Hears?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:55]** uh so where where does it say i don't know it it might just say for some reason you can't do take 20 on survival i don't think i'm happy to rule that you can't i just didn't want to breach some sort of super canon rule that's like you know like i don't think you can take 20 on medicine check for instance i think you can though around certain parts of the medicine check certain uses i think it's a whole like trained only thing so like survival is not trained only


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:49:56 - 00:49:56]** Take 20.

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:05]** You have the penalty or you have plenty of time to devote the skills and that task has no adverse effect upon failure.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:08]** The GM might rule that you can take 20 on that skill check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:08]** Great.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:13]** I'm going to rule that you guys can take 20 on a life science or a survival if you would like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:13 - 00:50:14]** I'll do take 20 on survival.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:16 - 00:50:17]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:50:17 - 00:50:18]** Take 20.

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:18]** Yeah.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:21]** Cool.

**[00:50:21 - 00:50:22]** Great.

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:25]** Rick, you're confident that

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:34]** Not only as you look and see that the workstation could not have been smashed by the Greybounder.

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:37]** It was probably a large creature at least.

**[00:50:39 - 00:50:45]** And the thing is that as you look, maybe there's a bit of a claw mark, but nothing like the tail, right?

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:49]** Seems like just massive pounds into the ground.

**[00:50:50 - 00:51:01]** and you look back to where the door is, and you do realize that something about the dust, it was just covered up maybe by the dust and the shaking and everything that's been happening.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:14]** But there are tracks of a large humanoid creature with clawed bare feet, but the tracks are inconsistent.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:19]** It's almost like this creature could move without touching the ground.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:39]** levitation and dr. okay maybe the two of you are talking and dr. okay you look and you see and you you know what Rick is saying and you think the same creature that ripped and rendered or rendered this gray it's probably the same creature

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:48]** And you surmise, the only type of creature I can think, based on everything that we know, is that this is some sort of a troll.

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:51]** But it's unlike any sort of troll that you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:53 - 00:52:04]** This creature is, I've never seen anything like this, but if what it is, is true, great power in this troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:09]** Is there any similarity to that other creature we fought in that experimental room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:13]** You would think that it's different enough.

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:17]** That creature seemed like a half-baked experimental creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:21]** No, this is something different.

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:24]** This is new, but more improved.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:29]** Bigger, stronger, everything, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:29]** Yeah.

**[00:52:30 - 00:52:31]** I mean, it's a large creature.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:35]** And Rick points out this thing can move without touching the ground.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:39]** Maybe it's at this time that Hears, you start to come in.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** Maybe about 10 minutes have passed.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** Nico, you come in.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:44]** What are the two of you thinking as you come in?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:49]** Hears was here, so he overheard what happened.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:51]** Yeah, it's probably in your comms too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:53]** Nico is silent.

**[00:52:55 - 00:52:56]** Definitely creeped out.

**[00:52:58 - 00:53:00]** But he's not he doesn't have any jokes for this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:03]** Here's like a troll.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:07]** And then Chad is actually still here, by the way, because he can be around for like hours.

**[00:53:08 - 00:53:11]** So and he's just going to commit.

**[00:53:12 - 00:53:13]** Chad comes into the room.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:13]** I got ahead of myself.

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:15]** I was going to have him do something, but I don't need to.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:20]** Here's is going to check out the door on the other side and see if there's a lock on it.

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:23]** See if there's a porthole, that kind of thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** Okay.

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:27]** There's no porthole on the door into the room.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:31]** And give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** Okay.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:35]** Here's.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:36]** All right.

**[00:53:36 - 00:53:37]** It's a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:38 - 00:53:40]** 22 doesn't appear to be locked.

**[00:53:41 - 00:53:45]** Appears that it was maybe damaged a little bit, but is overall pretty sturdy and intact.

**[00:53:46 - 00:53:56]** If anything, the rock smashing the once working machine next to it, maybe that caused it depressed the ground a little bit.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:59]** So if you look at the bottom, the floor is not flush.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:01]** It's just a little... Oh, there's a gap?

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:04]** Rick drops the floor and tries to get a peek underneath it.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:04]** It's a minuscule gap.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** You can't see anything.

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** Oh, okay, fine.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:06]** Oh, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:10]** So the computer thing, it's damaged.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** It was damaged by the creature and by this rock.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** It's unrepairable, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:17]** So the workstation was damaged by this large creature.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:21]** The machine that was damaged by the rock is a different machine.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:23]** That doesn't look like a computer.

**[00:54:23 - 00:54:25]** You don't know what that is.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:31]** You can give me a... If someone wants to give me an engineering or mysticism check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:31 - 00:54:33]** I think I did an engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** I'll do mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:36]** Okay.

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:39]** Nico, do you want to do engineering or mysticism?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:40 - 00:54:43]** Can I do a computer check or does that have to be engineering?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:43 - 00:54:45]** Engineering or mysticism.

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** 28 for mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:48 - 00:54:49]** I aid for engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:49]** So 30?

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:52]** 34.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** Okay, you all aid on engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:57]** We all ate on engineering, but nobody actually does the engineering.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:58]** I'll do the engineering.

**[00:54:58 - 00:55:00]** I'll be the foreman on the engineering.

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:01]** So that's plus nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:04]** Okay, so what was your roll then?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:04 - 00:55:06]** So my roll was 14 plus 9, so that's 23.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:07 - 00:55:08]** Okay.

**[00:55:08 - 00:55:10]** Because here's got a 28 on his roll.

**[00:55:10 - 00:55:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:12 - 00:55:13]** But it's mysticism.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:14]** Oh, for mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:14]** That's right.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:15]** For 28.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:16]** So 29.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:19]** 30, right?

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:22]** 23 plus 25.

**[00:55:22 - 00:55:26]** So 25 engineering, 30 mysticism.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:27 - 00:55:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:30]** Yeah, Kev, sorry.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:32]** I thought you were doing engineering on the workstation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:33]** No, we talked about that.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:36]** I was like, the computer at the top?

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** I didn't realize there was a computer at the workstation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** Yeah, it's a workstation with a computer.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:42]** Sorry, that's what I thought you meant.

**[00:55:42 - 00:55:43]** No, sorry.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:44]** Okay, clear it up.

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:52]** If you look on Roll20, you can see in the north here, there's this mass of gold and silver wires and blue, and then there's the smashed workstation where Dr. O'Kay is.

**[00:55:53 - 00:55:54]** All of you.

**[00:55:55 - 00:56:01]** are putting this together about what could this machine have been that was working when you came in the first time.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:07]** The workstation where the gray was at, the computer smashed.

**[00:56:08 - 00:56:10]** This machine off to the corner was working.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:12]** Odd.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:25]** You realize this is some sort of a gray communication unit that's built for wherever you are

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:30]** And you realize a couple things.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:35]** It only responds based on the way that it works.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:36]** You're like, there's no microphone.

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:46]** These crystals seem to have some sort of resonance of some frequency that doesn't make any sense to me based on my knowledge of material science or my knowledge of magic.

**[00:56:46 - 00:56:53]** Except here's something as you're looking and trying to figure this out, something pings.

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:57]** And you realize that whatever this could do when it worked...

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:03]** You would need to have some sort of mind link spell or be able to use telepathy.

**[00:57:05 - 00:57:07]** And that would allow you to connect this comm unit.

**[00:57:09 - 00:57:14]** Now, based on your engineering check, you think this is kind of a small comm unit.

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:17]** Maybe it's the size of like a water heater, right?

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** On the wall.

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:21]** Bulky, but not, you know...

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:30]** not too crazy, except then as you look in the wall, you see that some of the wall too has wires that were running through it.

**[00:57:30 - 00:57:37]** And so you realize that much of this wall, there's a network of crystals and wires that are within it.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:38]** So this is much larger.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:45]** And maybe this would be something that you would see for like a large base or a large building.

**[00:57:45 - 00:57:47]** This would be the kind of the comms room.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:55]** But knowing what you know about grades, you think this probably had a much larger range than normal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:56 - 00:58:00]** Like, yeah, like to our previous ship, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:01 - 00:58:05]** A huge range.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:09]** But you're not quite sure because, again, it's broken and you can't really connect to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:10 - 00:58:15]** Knowing this, Nico wants to scavenge this machine and what's left of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:19]** So, one, there's no way for you to remove all of this.

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** You can't just pick this up or move it out.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:22]** It's prohibitively bulky.

**[00:58:22 - 00:58:26]** You would need, like, construction whole event to come in.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:29]** Because it was smashed by the rocks...

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:33]** You're not going to get as much as you would have last time because it was working.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:34]** That's fair.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:34 - 00:58:45]** So what you can pull from the wires, you think there's enough here that would have been worth 1,250 credits and would have weighed five bulk?

**[00:58:45 - 00:58:47]** That's what would have been there if it was still working.

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:50]** Now you can only pull out about a fifth of that.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:53]** So it's maybe about 200 credits and it's one bulk.

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:57]** And again, make sure you're keeping track of this because your bulk will determine if you're encumbered.

**[00:58:58 - 00:58:59]** So make sure you add it to your Hero Lab sheet.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:04]** So again, crazy sort of comm unit that only works with telepathy.

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:08]** Makes sense, though, because you realize that none of the greys that you've seen speak.

**[00:59:09 - 00:59:10]** They don't vocalize.

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:13]** They use telepathy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:14 - 00:59:15]** Well, that makes sense then.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:19]** If they use telepathy, if they'd be able to communicate through a telepathic computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** It must connect to something else.

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:24]** But what it does, again, it's not working.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:26]** So you can't, you don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:27 - 00:59:30]** There's no way to get this working even with our advanced computering skills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:33]** Especially not now that it's fell.

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:34]** One last thing.

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:39]** Who was, Dr. K, you were working on the gray bounder, right?

**[00:59:39 - 00:59:40]** You were going through.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:43]** You did notice that the gray bounder had a collar attached.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:47]** This blue ornate collar of metal.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:52]** And there was a dark loop attached to it, almost like a tag.

**[00:59:54 - 01:00:01]** And as you pick it up, the way it looks, you're like, wait a minute.

**[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]** This reminds me.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:32]** of what dr benjamin had the cube that's a null space chamber and you realize this is an empty mark one null space chamber there's this tiny loop oh fascinating and that's all that you find on the gray boundary well i'm taking that so lots of lots of new information here and here's at the door so what are y'all thinking what do you what do you want to do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:33 - 01:01:02]** Niko wants to know with whatever the engineering place he has here whether or not he has enough equipment to upgrade his data pad with he wants to upgrade his data pad and have a comm unit in there I mean well your comm unit is already in your phones right you can already communicate this is a boosted comm unit that would allow him to remotely hack into things and remotely communicate with things outside of the ship


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:09]** I don't know that you have enough, and I think that it would take you probably a significant amount of time.

**[01:01:10 - 01:01:11]** And I mean significant, not like days.

**[01:01:11 - 01:01:15]** I'm just saying, like, you would need to sit down for a couple hours and work through this.

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** You would need to have that time.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:22]** If you want to take that time, again, we've talked about if you guys want to take more long hours of rest.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:24]** But you're certainly well on your way.

**[01:01:25 - 01:01:26]** Okay.

**[01:01:26 - 01:01:26]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:27 - 01:01:30]** Shall we enter this other space?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]** Here's his leg.

**[01:01:32 - 01:01:34]** Let's get Chad to open it.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:35]** Stand back.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:35]** Hey, man.

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:36]** Hold on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:36 - 01:01:37]** I think it's a smart thing to do.

**[01:01:38 - 01:01:39]** Let me finish my fish tacos.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:40]** Hold on.

**[01:01:40 - 01:01:40]** Hold on.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:42]** I got some fish tacos.

**[01:01:42 - 01:01:43]** He has fish tacos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:43 - 01:01:43]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:01:44 - 01:01:44]** Chad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:45 - 01:01:45]** Chad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:46 - 01:01:47]** Sup, Chad.

**[01:01:47 - 01:01:47]** Hey, sup.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:48]** All right, everyone.

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:49]** Stand back.

**[01:01:49 - 01:01:50]** I got this right.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:50]** All right.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** Stand back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:54]** Do I have to do this right now?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]** Yeah, you gotta do it, Chad.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:55]** Come on.

**[01:01:56 - 01:01:57]** You got like a couple more hours.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:59]** You're gonna be here for a while.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:59 - 01:02:00]** Chad opens the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:01]** Do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:02]** Do it.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:03]** Do it, Chad.

**[01:02:04 - 01:02:10]** Nico takes out his blaster again, so now he's dual wielding his dueling sword and his blaster pistol again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:02:10 - 01:02:12]** Gonna do a polygonal reveal here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:13 - 01:02:15]** Also, does anybody want the shock hammer here?

**[01:02:15 - 01:02:21]** Niko's gonna be encumbered if he continues to get hit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]** What is it called?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:24]** It's a shock hammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:24 - 01:02:25]** I've been encumbered this entire game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:27]** Oh, I already have a bunch of weapons.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:30]** The diamagnetic storm hammer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:32 - 01:02:33]** Let me see.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:35]** I don't even know if I can use that.

**[01:02:35 - 01:02:38]** Two-handed advanced melee weapon.

**[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]** I can't use advanced.

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:45]** I mean, does anyone have a lot of inventory space?

**[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:48 - 01:02:48]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:02:49 - 01:02:51]** You have that backpack, Dr. Okay, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:51 - 01:02:53]** Yeah, but it's, like, full.

**[01:02:54 - 01:02:55]** It's got our medkits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:55 - 01:02:58]** It's got, like... How much does it weigh, Nico?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:00 - 01:03:03]** I've been encumbered almost this entire game because I have my armor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:04 - 01:03:06]** It's one bulk on its own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:14]** My armor, my weapon, and then my two weapons, my tactical axe and my astral laser.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:03:14 - 01:03:14]** I can't use it.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** I mean, I could carry it, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:25]** And Cumber gives you, let's see, reduces your max AC bonus to plus two, so that's probably why my AC is so low.

**[01:03:25 - 01:03:29]** And it also gives you a minus five to strength and dex base checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:03:30 - 01:03:36]** I mean, here's... Hey, man, I'll carry it for now until you free up space, all right?

**[01:03:36 - 01:03:37]** Sounds good to me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:38 - 01:03:41]** I'm going to move this to... Are you planning to use it?

**[01:03:41 - 01:03:43]** No, but he doesn't want to lose it.

**[01:03:43 - 01:03:45]** It's kind of like in Skyrim, you give your shit to Lydia.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:47]** Like, I'll be your Lydia.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:47]** Yeah.

**[01:03:47 - 01:03:51]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** But I'm going to not reluctantly do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:52]** It's really good.

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:53]** Okay.

**[01:03:54 - 01:03:55]** We'll split the profits of this thing.

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:58]** This thing's worth at least 1,200 credits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:58 - 01:03:58]** All right, for sure.

**[01:03:59 - 01:04:01]** I have a lot of space, so it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:04]** How do I move this, John, on Hero Lab?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:04 - 01:04:05]** Just take it off.

**[01:04:06 - 01:04:07]** Kelly will put it on his.

**[01:04:08 - 01:04:08]** All right.

**[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]** I'll put it on at the end of the round here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:12]** I still don't understand.

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:14]** So encumbered is if you're half your bulk.

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:15]** Is that right?

**[01:04:15 - 01:04:16]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:17]** Yeah, I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:18 - 01:04:21]** What's the point of having a bulk of 12 if you're encumbered through half of that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:21 - 01:04:23]** You literally can't carry anything else, maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:26]** It doesn't define what encumbered means, though.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:26 - 01:04:28]** Well, yeah, it does.

**[01:04:28 - 01:04:29]** All in the conditions.

**[01:04:29 - 01:04:31]** All of your speeds are reduced by 10 feet.

**[01:04:31 - 01:04:32]** Your maximum dexterity bonus is plus 2.

**[01:04:33 - 01:04:35]** Minus 5 to strengthen deck space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:38]** No, like, what is the... The threshold.

**[01:04:39 - 01:04:41]** Yes, where does it define that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:42]** I can't find it either right now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:43 - 01:04:45]** I'm going to the index for carrying capacity.

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:48]** Carrying capacity, item bulk, bulk limits.

**[01:04:48 - 01:04:51]** You can carry a mount of up to half your strength score without difficulty.

**[01:04:52 - 01:04:54]** If you carry more than that, you gain the incoming condition.

**[01:04:54 - 01:04:55]** So what's your strength score, Kev?

**[01:04:55 - 01:04:56]** 12?

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:56]** I don't know.

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:58]** Got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:02]** My strength score is as much as my bulk.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:04]** So I guess that makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:04]** So you're fine.

**[01:05:05 - 01:05:07]** So up to or equal to that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:05:08 - 01:05:19]** and i'm at seven so i'm over that i've been encumbered literally like since i picked up this axe because the axe is one the gun is three and my armor is three so like i've been encumbered so your strength is only seven

**[01:05:19 - 01:05:20]** I need a smaller gun.

**[01:05:21 - 01:05:22]** What's your strength?

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:24]** Twelve.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** Then you're fine, right?

**[01:05:26 - 01:05:29]** Because you are not encumbered until you get to... Half of your strength.

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:30]** That's not what I heard from John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:34]** It's up to half your strength.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:34 - 01:05:35]** Oh, I thought it was the full strength.

**[01:05:35 - 01:05:36]** Okay, my bad.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:38]** Okay, I see.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:41]** Well, I'm fine with the storm hammer for now.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:43]** Okay.

**[01:05:43 - 01:05:44]** What does Chad see?

**[01:05:45 - 01:05:46]** Good question.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:49]** I'm going to read it and then I'll reveal it.

**[01:05:51 - 01:05:57]** Chad sees, and therefore you, you can see that this room too has been heavily damaged.

**[01:05:59 - 01:06:07]** You can see that there are small chairs, maybe some delicate desks that were overturned.

**[01:06:09 - 01:06:14]** You can see what appears to be maybe three doors, three sets of doors.

**[01:06:15 - 01:06:22]** There's one on the far west wall, and then there's another one to the north, and there's one right next to it.

**[01:06:22 - 01:06:25]** It appears the room curves a little bit to the north.

**[01:06:26 - 01:06:40]** On the sides against the ceiling, on the top part of the ceiling, sorry, the top part of the wall and the ceiling, there's this glistening green substance that's stained and spattered across the ceiling.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:46]** Also, weirdly, maybe what appeared to have been maybe models?

**[01:06:47 - 01:07:17]** little toys some of the little craft projects little tangles of wires and bibs and bobs and crystal pebbles with all these hues green purple blue all scattered across the floor and it's mixed with like detritus from the broken furniture so there's probably two sets of stations one right in front of the door and then one closer to the end and then this big pile of something on in the back wall

**[01:07:17 - 01:07:18]** And two things stand out.

**[01:07:20 - 01:07:32]** The first is that over on the other side of the room appear to be a few ripped and crushed cartons of some sort of like little action figure.

**[01:07:33 - 01:07:35]** Can't tell what it is.

**[01:07:35 - 01:07:37]** It's just over a pile of them in the corner.

**[01:07:37 - 01:07:42]** And also that in the center of the room is a pristine vending machine.

**[01:07:42 - 01:07:47]** And it casts light over that entire side of the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:49 - 01:07:50]** And I'll reveal it here on the map.

**[01:07:50 - 01:07:51]** Oh, wow.

**[01:07:51 - 01:07:53]** There's a lot of crystal things laying around.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:53 - 01:08:10]** I'm going to enter, seeing all this arrayed, I'm going to go basically and see what these items are and head towards the vending machine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:08:11 - 01:08:12]** Just remember that wasn't a perception check.

**[01:08:12 - 01:08:14]** That was just description of the room.

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:16]** So be careful of traps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:19]** So Dr. Okay walks in about halfway across the room, and Nico walks into the room.

**[01:08:20 - 01:08:20]** Yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:21]** Yep.

**[01:08:21 - 01:08:23]** Along the wall, the north wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:24]** Along the wall.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:28]** Okay, so as you get closer to the vending machine...

**[01:08:30 - 01:08:33]** you realize that it's probably battery operated.

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:35]** You don't see any wires coming to it, which is a little weird.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:40]** You're like, I feel like, I feel like vending machines have wires, but it's fine.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:42]** But as you step and get closer, Dr.

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:43]** O.K.,

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:45]** And Nico too.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:48]** Maybe Dr. K is sliding, gliding, right?

**[01:08:48 - 01:09:05]** And Dr. K with each footstep, or sorry, Nico with each footstep or rumble of the room, the machine kind of, the light, you know, the light jumps, blacks out for a second, comes back.

**[01:09:06 - 01:09:08]** It's very sensitive to vibration.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:11]** Okay.

**[01:09:11 - 01:09:12]** Roll perception.

**[01:09:12 - 01:09:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:14]** Roll perception.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:17 - 01:09:18]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:18 - 01:09:19]** What'd you get?

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:20]** 22.

**[01:09:20 - 01:09:20]** 24 for me.

**[01:09:21 - 01:09:24]** 24 from Nico, 22 from Dr. Okay.

**[01:09:25 - 01:09:28]** You're still behind it, so you can't quite tell, but it does look familiar.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:33]** You would need to go see what's on the face of it to see what's going on.

**[01:09:33 - 01:09:37]** So I'll slide over.

**[01:09:37 - 01:09:37]** Take a look.

**[01:09:38 - 01:09:40]** So you walk up to the front of it.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:42]** You realize that

**[01:09:43 - 01:09:44]** Sorry, Nico, what?

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:46]** Nico will help.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:54]** Okay, so Nico and Dr. Okay walk up to the front of this weird vending machine that's sitting in the middle of the room.

**[01:09:55 - 01:10:01]** You see it's written in common that it's a fusion fizz dispenser machine.

**[01:10:03 - 01:10:11]** And you look at the buttons where the screen displays all the possible drinks that you can get.

**[01:10:11 - 01:10:21]** And you remember some of these are not geared towards kids, but they're very carbonated, sweet energy beverages.

**[01:10:23 - 01:10:24]** You recognize it immediately.

**[01:10:25 - 01:10:28]** You see Starstone Apple.

**[01:10:29 - 01:10:30]** You've had that.

**[01:10:31 - 01:10:32]** Leovara Lush.

**[01:10:32 - 01:10:32]** You've had that.

**[01:10:33 - 01:10:34]** Skitter Rocket Blast.

**[01:10:35 - 01:10:36]** You've had these drinks before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:10:38 - 01:10:39]** Cashball Fruit Punch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:10:40 - 01:10:44]** Is this where the kids were in that one flashback that you gave us?

**[01:10:44 - 01:10:45]** I wonder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:10:45 - 01:10:47]** What about these crystals on the floor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:10:48 - 01:11:11]** the it just as gm to you kelly like no it doesn't seem like like this is there but this is like seeing a pepsi vending machine okay you know didn't if i was like destroyed cafeteria or something yeah okay um i see dr k you look down at these little these little uh gems

## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:02 - 01:12:04]** Yeah.

**[01:12:04 - 01:12:05]** Has anybody looked at the crystals yet?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:06 - 01:12:07]** Yeah, Dr. K did.

**[01:12:09 - 01:12:10]** They're just plastic toys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:12:10 - 01:12:14]** These appear to be some sort of toy.

**[01:12:14 - 01:12:20]** Some childlike manufactured product.

**[01:12:20 - 01:12:22]** This vending machine.

**[01:12:22 - 01:12:24]** Another remnant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:25 - 01:12:29]** Can I do a survival check on...

## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:12:51 - 01:12:54]** If you guys want to... I'm going to say that you rolled it.

**[01:12:56 - 01:12:57]** That you didn't take 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:12:57 - 01:12:59]** I don't ever want to roll a dice again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:00 - 01:13:01]** Well, but you can't always do that.

**[01:13:01 - 01:13:03]** I'm going to say in this moment you can't take 20.

**[01:13:03 - 01:13:04]** So you rolled it.

**[01:13:04 - 01:13:05]** You're not quite sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:13:05 - 01:13:07]** I'm just bad at my rolls being so low.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:13:07 - 01:13:10]** There's two doors here, gents.

**[01:13:10 - 01:13:17]** So, Rick, you are walking around, and Hears is still at the door.

**[01:13:17 - 01:13:18]** Chad is chilling with Hears.

**[01:13:19 - 01:13:21]** Nico's standing next to the machine.

**[01:13:21 - 01:13:22]** Rick walks up in front of the machine.

**[01:13:23 - 01:13:25]** Rick, as you're walking, you're focused totally on the ground.

**[01:13:26 - 01:13:30]** And you walk up, walk up.

**[01:13:30 - 01:13:31]** You look.

**[01:13:31 - 01:13:32]** Again, the tracks...

**[01:13:34 - 01:13:38]** There hasn't been as much dust here, but there's still a lot of toys that you have to brush them aside.

**[01:13:38 - 01:13:40]** But as you do, you brush the tracks again.

**[01:13:40 - 01:13:46]** The tracks seem to jump like it's not moving and just step, step, step, step, step.

**[01:13:46 - 01:13:49]** There are gaps of 10, 20 feet randomly.

**[01:13:50 - 01:13:56]** Seems like probably this troll damaged these computer stations.

**[01:13:56 - 01:13:58]** Maybe the...

**[01:13:58 - 01:13:59]** The boxes of toys in the corner.

**[01:14:00 - 01:14:01]** But not the vending machine.

**[01:14:02 - 01:14:03]** Not everything, which is weird.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:14:04 - 01:14:06]** After his rampage, he just pulls out a couple sodas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:06 - 01:14:07]** Just rampage.

**[01:14:08 - 01:14:11]** But there are some projects, some little toys, crafts that are still intact.

**[01:14:11 - 01:14:13]** You're able to kind of put together.

**[01:14:13 - 01:14:18]** It's just weird physical...

**[01:14:18 - 01:14:20]** ephemera pop culture stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:14:20 - 01:14:24]** Could we say that there's some emotional attachment to these items?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:14:25 - 01:14:28]** Maybe, but it's a random smattering of items.

**[01:14:28 - 01:14:36]** It's just like somebody took the most popular Tonka and Lego and drinks and maybe some things even that are

**[01:14:36 - 01:15:06]** you know from like the container store things i'm trying to pull real world references so that way we know that you know what it is they're just bits and bobs like it's a it's it's just a strange collection of pop culture paraphernalia rick a couple things dr okay you walk over you're looking down and you realize that give me culture check dr okay

**[01:15:07 - 01:15:08]** 19.

**[01:15:09 - 01:15:18]** As you walk over, as you move over, you realize these are little Sheeran-shaped plush toys in these boxes.

**[01:15:18 - 01:15:19]** There's maybe 15, 20 of them.

**[01:15:21 - 01:15:28]** And you remember, these were sold by this company called Key Toys.

**[01:15:29 - 01:15:32]** And then underneath it, it says a division of Avidar Corp.

**[01:15:34 - 01:15:41]** And it's written across the top next to just, you know, like sheer and plush.

**[01:15:41 - 01:15:45]** But these are probably some, it's Avatar Corp, but they're maybe a little third party.

**[01:15:45 - 01:15:47]** Because, do you remember these were recalled?

**[01:15:48 - 01:15:52]** Because some children were allergic to the authentic Skittermander fur.

**[01:15:53 - 01:15:58]** Which Avatar Corp said, this was harvested from paid volunteers.

**[01:15:58 - 01:16:02]** marketed as a premium feature of the toy.

**[01:16:03 - 01:16:11]** But you think about it now, these have been discontinued for so long that they're probably very valuable, these boxes of toys.

**[01:16:13 - 01:16:14]** Which is weird.

**[01:16:15 - 01:16:19]** And Dr. K, give me a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:16:19 - 01:16:23]** Sorry, these were the Skittermander toys or these were replacements for the Skittermander toys?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:23 - 01:16:28]** These are Sheeran plush toys that are made from authentic Skittermander fur.

**[01:16:30 - 01:16:31]** Sorry, what was the check?

**[01:16:31 - 01:16:32]** A perception check.

**[01:16:32 - 01:16:35]** 19.

**[01:16:35 - 01:16:37]** 19.

**[01:16:37 - 01:16:37]** Okay.

**[01:16:38 - 01:16:40]** Nico and Rick, here's...

**[01:16:41 - 01:16:43]** I'm not sure what you're thinking standing at the door.

**[01:16:43 - 01:16:45]** Maybe you're just chilling with Chad.

**[01:16:45 - 01:16:46]** But, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:16:47 - 01:16:49]** No, I mean, does he see that?

**[01:16:49 - 01:16:50]** Like, see these little plush toys?

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:51]** Not from this far away.

**[01:16:51 - 01:16:52]** All right.

**[01:16:54 - 01:16:56]** Well, the curiosity gets it better the many ways he moves in.

**[01:16:56 - 01:16:56]** But go ahead, Zach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:16:57 - 01:16:57]** Starts walking in.

**[01:16:57 - 01:16:58]** Okay.

**[01:16:58 - 01:16:59]** So you're walking up.

**[01:16:59 - 01:17:01]** Nico, you're standing next to the machine.

**[01:17:01 - 01:17:02]** Maybe you're just leaning on the machine.

**[01:17:02 - 01:17:03]** You're just taking a breath.

**[01:17:03 - 01:17:05]** You're still catching up from that 10-minute rest.

**[01:17:05 - 01:17:05]** You just need a second.

**[01:17:06 - 01:17:09]** Just... He just walks up beside you.

**[01:17:10 - 01:17:21]** both of you look at each other and then you look at Rick and Rick just has that Android.

**[01:17:23 - 01:17:46]** motionless sense and rick is staring at this machine this vending machine the light you're casting a huge shadow behind you because it's one of the only sources of light in this pretty dim room because rick as you approach the machine something tingled i'm not quite sure what it was and with each step

**[01:17:47 - 01:17:51]** you felt your skin growing warmer.

**[01:17:51 - 01:17:54]** And you don't recall being suddenly right in front of the machine.

**[01:17:55 - 01:18:02]** And your skin just feels warmer and warmer as if there's a hot breeze that's blowing.

**[01:18:02 - 01:18:13]** And the sound of many, many voices talking, shouting seems to fill your auditory senses for a brief moment.

**[01:18:13 - 01:18:16]** and the machine in front of you seems brighter as if there was sunlight on it.

**[01:18:17 - 01:18:24]** You just sense the presence of so many people all around you, this bustle and this commotion.

**[01:18:25 - 01:18:32]** And then just out of nowhere, all of it, the heat, the voices, the light, it all stops as quickly as it came.

**[01:18:32 - 01:18:36]** Nico, in here, you're wondering why Rick is this motionless.

**[01:18:36 - 01:18:37]** But Dr.

**[01:18:37 - 01:18:40]** O.K., Dr. O.K.

**[01:18:40 - 01:18:46]** doesn't see that one of the boxes goes...

**[01:18:48 - 01:19:18]** glitches and the top pops off and one of the sheer and plush toys the pincers run these these long green pincers with blades shoot up out of the box ambush and it leaps at dr. okay and that's our game oh my god it's like small soldiers we can't catch a break there's always some something yeah

**[01:19:24 - 01:19:41]** Hey y'all, this is John Swan, and I was just so touched by Kelly's outro last week, it being so heartfelt, that I wanted to make sure that this week, on the week of Thanksgiving, that we here at Will Save wanted to let you know that we are thankful for you.

**[01:19:56 - 01:19:58]** So with that, you know what you deserve?

**[01:19:58 - 01:20:01]** You deserve maybe an extra slice of pecan pie.

**[01:20:01 - 01:20:02]** That's what I want.

**[01:20:02 - 01:20:06]** Or maybe some sweet potato casserole or whatever it is.

**[01:20:06 - 01:20:09]** I think right after this, go treat yourself because you know what?

**[01:20:09 - 01:20:10]** You deserve it.

**[01:20:10 - 01:20:11]** Maybe you're working.

**[01:20:11 - 01:20:13]** Maybe being with family is tough.

**[01:20:13 - 01:20:16]** Maybe you're on the road or sometimes you don't need a reason.

**[01:20:16 - 01:20:20]** Just go take a slice for yourself.

**[01:20:20 - 01:20:21]** So enjoy it.
