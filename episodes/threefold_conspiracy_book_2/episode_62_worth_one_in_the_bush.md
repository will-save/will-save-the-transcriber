**[00:00:00 - 00:00:03]** Previously on Will Save.

**[00:00:03 - 00:00:16]** The team tangled with a swarm Korvok shock trooper who appeared to have a particular predilection for Krog as the trooper's gaze towards the Akeshti was unfazed by our ally's assaults.

**[00:00:16 - 00:00:28]** Clawed at the Corvox, crashing his way through the room, crushing computers and equipment in his wake, and bravely bore a white-hot brand courtesy of the uppercutting insectoid.

**[00:00:28 - 00:00:44]** But it was another swarm spawn that brought the trooper to the term, as here supercharged Rick's artillery laser and gave his weapon the loving, inspirational encouragement it needed to allow the murder-loving machine Rick-19 to deliver a giant bundle of holy crap that's a big laser.

**[00:00:44 - 00:00:53]** as the android was able to vaporize the shock trooper's bust and burst the battler's brains, blowing up the brute like a bottle of Diet Coke and Mentos.

**[00:00:54 - 00:00:57]** With the dust settling around our allies, Dr. O.K.

**[00:00:57 - 00:01:13]** notices a strange Aklo article with the word Nekral scrawled on its face, appearing to be related to the relic Hears recovered from the Chimera, as the mystical object in Hears' possession begins to glow as it's brought nearer to the Aklo artifact.

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:16]** Will our alliance find answers to this mystical nightlight?

**[00:01:17 - 00:01:20]** Or are these adventurers headed for a long good night?

**[00:01:21 - 00:01:24]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:19 - 00:02:23]** Does anyone here like practical jokes?

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** You a practical jokester?

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:26]** No?

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:29]** I'm getting some nod by default.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:29 - 00:02:30]** I'm guilty of a few press releases.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** You're guilty?

**[00:02:31 - 00:02:35]** I was hoping somebody would bite and they did.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:38]** The question is, are you an April Fool's Day?

**[00:02:38 - 00:02:41]** Or is that just an old holdover?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:43]** I'm not an April Fool's Day guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:47]** I feel like you gotta be a specific type of person to be an April Fool's Day guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:52]** I was an April Fool's Day guy until I was like 11, and then I decided it's probably not good anymore.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:52 - 00:02:53]** What were your jokes?

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:57]** I've met April Fool's guys in their 30s.

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** You know, they're okay.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:00]** Are they?

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:05]** Yeah, they're fine, but I don't want to hang out with them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:05 - 00:03:09]** I feel like you can definitely tell an April Fool's person, you know, they just got that personality.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:09 - 00:03:14]** You know, I got that face where they're just like, yeah, they know, you know, they're like holding a joke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:14 - 00:03:21]** And yeah, I mean, I used to just so like, I don't let practical jokes be my like, that's too far.

**[00:03:22 - 00:03:23]** You're just too stupid jokes constantly.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:25]** So I never let go above that.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:47]** you know kevin is dad jokes and rants and other things that are funny that's true that's your whole personality but my mom growing up my mom was hardcore into april fools um a couple times one time because you know it's around easter um she woke my dad up at 2 a.m and was like somebody ate the car somebody ate the car and i'm like

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:51]** My dad goes out there and there are plastic eggs all over the car.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:52]** And that was it.

**[00:03:53 - 00:03:56]** She moved the car down the street, told me it was stolen at midnight.

**[00:03:56 - 00:03:57]** What?

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** Oh, my God.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:00]** That's so intense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:00]** I know.

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** Oh, I'm telling you.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:02]** I don't know what she's done this year.

**[00:04:02 - 00:04:03]** I have to ask her.

**[00:04:03 - 00:04:12]** But the worst one that she ever told me, and my dad confirmed it, is one time my dad used to... I think he's still... I don't know.

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:13]** He slept nude growing up.

**[00:04:13 - 00:04:15]** That's a whole other psychological thing.

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:17]** But


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:17 - 00:04:18]** It's really comfortable.

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:21]** It's pretty great, Kev.

**[00:04:21 - 00:04:21]** Hold on, hold on.

**[00:04:22 - 00:04:23]** I don't want to talk about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:29]** Anyways, she took all of his underwear and put it in the freezer.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:32]** So my father, who doesn't wear underwear to bed...

**[00:04:33 - 00:04:36]** didn't have any underwear to put on when he got up at, you know, four in the morning to go to work.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:37]** Yeah.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:38]** Wow.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:39]** Wow.

**[00:04:39 - 00:04:40]** I was like, that's cool.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:41]** And it was cold.

**[00:04:41 - 00:04:42]** It was really cold.

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:43 - 00:04:47]** If you live in like, like, I don't know, Wisconsin, that probably wouldn't be a big deal.

**[00:04:47 - 00:04:49]** They would just like crack it and keep going.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:52]** But what are you trying to say about people in Wisconsin?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:53]** They're used to living in the cold.

**[00:04:54 - 00:04:55]** My dad's from California.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:57]** He's actually, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:57 - 00:04:59]** Kelly, what were the jokes that you did when you were young?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:00 - 00:05:01]** I'm completely outclassed.

**[00:05:01 - 00:05:05]** These are like actually borderline psychopathic and I can't hold a candle to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:07]** It's the family I grew up in.

**[00:05:07 - 00:05:08]** Just, hi mom and dad, I love you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:19]** Maybe I would just do stupid stuff like, I don't know, like cover like a lollipop in like salt or something and give it to my like dad or something.

**[00:05:19 - 00:05:20]** Nothing like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:20 - 00:05:24]** Nothing like, oh my God, so-and-so got murdered.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:24]** Wake up.

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:26]** Like putting sugar in the salt shaker or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:26 - 00:05:28]** Yeah, that kind of thing.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:28]** Exactly.

**[00:05:28 - 00:05:31]** Putting Tabasco in the ketchup bottle.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** Ooh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** Actually, that's a really good one.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]** I should do that to Kevin.

**[00:05:34 - 00:05:35]** Oh, we should do that with Kevin.

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:37]** Kevin does not like spicy food.

**[00:05:37 - 00:05:38]** I didn't even hear what you said.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:40]** That's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:47]** Next time you're here, nothing nefarious will happen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:48]** Definitely not.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** You're in good hands, Kev.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:51]** All your condiments are fine.

**[00:05:52 - 00:05:53]** Don't question them at all.

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:55]** I brought my own ketchup.

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:57]** I walk around with my own ketchup.

**[00:05:57 - 00:06:01]** There was one time when it was the holiday season.

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** Maybe it's a better holiday story.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:07]** And my buddy was like, hey, do you want to go deer humping?

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:07]** And I was like, what?

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:12]** And he was like, just come over at like 9 p.m.

**[00:06:12 - 00:06:13]** I was like, all right.

**[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]** So we go to his neighborhood.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** And then I show up to his house.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:17]** It's 9 p.m.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:18]** We like chill for a bit.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** You know, it's like early 2000s.

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:24]** We like hang out, like play Halo and do or like, you know, Oblivion, like all that kind of stuff.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:24]** Right.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:27]** And then it's 11 and he's like, all right, let's roll.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** So we get in the car.

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:30]** It's foggy in northern Florida.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** I just want to stop you.

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:35]** Like if if somebody invited me to go deer humping, I think my answer would just be no.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:36]** That'd be the end of the story.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:39]** I'm not going to lie.

**[00:06:39 - 00:06:40]** I would at least go for the ride along.

**[00:06:40 - 00:06:41]** Yeah, come on.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** I would want to see what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:45]** You got to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** It's too weird a thing.

**[00:06:47 - 00:06:55]** So picture a foggy midnight in northern Florida, and we're driving around this neighborhood where you can only see the streetlights through the fog.

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:59]** But as we're driving, you can also see people's Christmas decorations.

**[00:07:00 - 00:07:04]** And so as we pull up to one, he's like, all right, let's go.

**[00:07:04 - 00:07:05]** We jump out of the car.

**[00:07:05 - 00:07:06]** I'm confused what's going on.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:14]** And they rearrange the deer to be in a lot of different sexual positions.

**[00:07:14 - 00:07:18]** And then we run back in the car and we terrorize the neighborhood for two hours.

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:19]** Fun times.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** Fun times.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** That's pretty good, actually.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** Yeah, that's awesome.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:24]** I'm going to do that next Christmas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:24 - 00:07:29]** In Maryland, you're going to be the scourge of... That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:29 - 00:07:31]** He's just like Kevin as a grown-up man.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:32]** Laughing.

**[00:07:32 - 00:07:35]** Yeah, it's just you by yourself.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:37]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:07:37 - 00:07:38]** Like looking out the window.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:40]** Intense.

**[00:07:40 - 00:07:41]** All right.

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:44]** I'm going to call it because I want to see what's going on with you all.

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:46]** So I think we should play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:49]** I just want to mention mine, though, real quick.

**[00:07:49 - 00:07:51]** I pulled it off my wife like years ago.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:52]** Okay.

**[00:07:52 - 00:07:55]** And it still persists to this day.

**[00:07:56 - 00:08:04]** Basically, you guys do the prank where you change people's shortcut macros in their phone to different words.

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:05]** This is what you did.

**[00:08:05 - 00:08:07]** This is what I did to my wife.

**[00:08:07 - 00:08:10]** And so, yeah, they're all...

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:17]** basically just like the Tom Haverford's food slangs from Parks and Rec.

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:20]** So like food rakes is like forks.

**[00:08:21 - 00:08:22]** Amazing.

**[00:08:23 - 00:08:26]** Like pre-birds are eggs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:29 - 00:08:31]** So whenever she types eggs, it says pre-birds?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:33]** Yeah, so if she's like, hey, can you pick up some eggs?

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:36]** It'll say like, pick up some pre-birds.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:38]** Does it still say that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:38]** Yeah.

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:38]** That's awesome.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** She just never changed it.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:43]** Yeah.

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:43]** That's so good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:43 - 00:08:44]** Yeah.

**[00:08:45 - 00:08:47]** That's a long con because she hasn't changed it yet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:47 - 00:08:48]** She hasn't changed it.

**[00:08:49 - 00:08:50]** Oh, long con.

**[00:08:50 - 00:08:51]** One day.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:08:51 - 00:08:53]** I have hacking stories for another time.

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:55]** I mean, there's plenty of hacking stories.

**[00:08:55 - 00:08:55]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:58]** That's what we'll talk about next week.

**[00:08:58 - 00:08:59]** Your first hack.

**[00:08:59 - 00:09:00]** I don't have a story.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:05]** I'm just going to listen to you computer people just go crazy.

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:06]** That'll be fun.

**[00:09:06 - 00:09:07]** Get your popcorn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:07]** Stay tuned.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:08]** Stay tuned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:12]** All right, let's play some Starfinder.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:17]** Let me find my dramatic music that I always use at the beginning when I do a recap.

**[00:09:19 - 00:09:24]** Ah, found it.

**[00:09:24 - 00:09:31]** We're going to start right in when the door busts down as Frog...

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:41]** shouts at this creature standing motionless in this dim, almost abandoned, mostly destroyed laboratory.

**[00:09:43 - 00:09:45]** It turns out to be the Swarm Corvox.

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:48]** Where is this music?

**[00:09:48 - 00:09:49]** Ah, there it is.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:55]** It turns out to be the Swarm Corvox, but heavily modified with cybernetics.

**[00:09:57 - 00:10:00]** And you all handily take this creature out.

**[00:10:00 - 00:10:04]** I think it only got one turn in which it branded Frog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** Oh, it branded him?

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** We didn't know that.

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** Yeah, we did.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:11]** Is it like a mark, a symbol?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:12 - 00:10:13]** Yeah, it's a branding iron, man.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** Yeah, dude.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:16]** It was called the Red Solar Brand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:18]** I don't remember talking about this.

**[00:10:18 - 00:10:20]** Did we analyze the symbol?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:23]** It was a triangle.

**[00:10:23 - 00:10:25]** You haven't done that yet, though.

**[00:10:27 - 00:10:31]** So, again, you take out the creature very quickly.

**[00:10:31 - 00:10:44]** In fact, after some wonderful, beautiful prose from Hears, who encourages Rick's gun to be better than it ever could have been before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:45]** It's very best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:45 - 00:10:46]** It's very best.

**[00:10:47 - 00:10:48]** Like no one ever was.

**[00:10:48 - 00:10:52]** Then you literally blow the creature away.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:59]** And as the head pops off, it explodes in electricity, damaging Bernice and Hrog.

**[00:10:59 - 00:11:01]** And you all make your way in.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:03]** Hrog was the only one to go in besides Bernice.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:07]** And you all say, all right, coast is clear.

**[00:11:07 - 00:11:13]** Lights go out for a second as electricity arcs among all the whatever fixtures remain.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** And you all step in.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** You begin looking around.

**[00:11:17 - 00:11:30]** And first you see that there are four test tubes, and three of them are other dead Corvoxes, also modified, but their body's not quite fully there.

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:30]** It's weird.

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:35]** And no head, because it's probably been exploded from a cortex bomb.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:47]** So, realizing now that there might be something else in here, Dr. O'Keefe notices a small piece of metal

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:50]** Looks like it might have belonged to something larger.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:51]** You don't know.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:56]** It's like torn or sheared off like it was part of an explosion or broken, whatever originally held it.

**[00:11:58 - 00:12:05]** And in Aklo, on the piece of metal, it says, spells out the words or the word Nakrawl.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:13]** He brings it up with Rick and Hears, and you all do a culture check.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:15]** You try and think back, what does that mean?

**[00:12:16 - 00:12:27]** And Nakral, you recall, Dr. O'Kay, that it is somehow affiliated with some sort of Baratheon megamind or supermind, right?

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:29]** You don't quite know what.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:30]** It's not really talked about.

**[00:12:30 - 00:12:36]** It's not like Confluence, which is such a big player in Baratheon politics.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:37 - 00:12:38]** Yeah.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:39]** And I hate Jira, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:45]** I'm going to move you guys back over to the map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:52]** I got Kelly on that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** Yeah.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:52]** Sorry.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** Don't apologize.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:56]** I'm sure there are other people out there who were like, ha, we got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** I didn't get it.

**[00:12:57 - 00:13:01]** I know what Jira is, but I don't understand the joke.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:01]** Yeah, I don't.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** Never mind.

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** Yeah, I don't know what it is.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:03]** It's fine.

**[00:13:03 - 00:13:04]** No, explain it to me.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:04]** No, don't.

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:05]** I want to know.

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** Actually, yes, it's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:06 - 00:13:07]** Really?

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:08]** No, it's okay.

**[00:13:08 - 00:13:10]** Confluence is a... No, anyway.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:10]** Okay.

**[00:13:10 - 00:13:12]** It's a piece of software that goes along with Jira.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:12]** Oh.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:14]** By Atlassian.

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** Trademark.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:17]** Good thing Atlassian is our sponsor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:17 - 00:13:18]** Yeah.

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:19]** Not our sponsor.

**[00:13:19 - 00:13:20]** We'll never be our sponsor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:22]** Please.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** Never say never.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:23 - 00:13:25]** Don't sponsor us.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** Please don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:26 - 00:13:28]** I don't want to be associated.

**[00:13:28 - 00:13:31]** We publish a list of people we don't want to be our sponsors.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:32]** That's all that we do.

**[00:13:33 - 00:13:34]** These are our sponsors.

**[00:13:34 - 00:13:36]** We hope these are never our sponsors.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:39]** So what do you all want to do?

**[00:13:39 - 00:13:43]** Not sponsored by Nazis.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:47 - 00:13:48]** That's what we did.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:50]** Not sponsored by polar bears.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:55]** Most overrated animal on the planet, by the way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:55 - 00:13:57]** They're so cute.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:13:57 - 00:14:00]** They eviscerate seals on a regular basis.

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:00]** They're not that cute.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** They're just covered in blood.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:03]** And terrorize Eskimos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:03 - 00:14:05]** Speaking of eviscerated...

**[00:15:08 - 00:15:10]** You said it was a triangle.

**[00:15:10 - 00:15:11]** It is a triangle.

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:13]** That's the will save tattoo.

**[00:15:14 - 00:15:18]** That's the will save tattoo.

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** Man, we killed the wrong guy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** No, we didn't.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:25]** Please say no, we didn't.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:29]** No, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:29]** I didn't say anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:33]** No, that hurt pretty badly.

**[00:15:33 - 00:15:34]** Sorry.

**[00:15:35 - 00:15:38]** Yeah, I'm just going to sit for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:42]** I don't know what you want to do, but I'm going to sit.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:45]** Looks like he just needs a minute.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:49]** Maybe something about being in this room really brought him back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:54]** Do you want to step out in the hallway, Frog, while we search the rest of this room?

**[00:15:55 - 00:15:56]** Sure.

**[00:15:57 - 00:15:58]** Are you comfortable right now?

**[00:15:59 - 00:15:59]** Are you okay?

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:02]** I'm fine right here, but...

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:16]** Well, Bernice is going to hang out with you, and in case something, you know, while we're searching around here, she'll be with you, and in case something goes wrong, she'll signal.

**[00:16:16 - 00:16:17]** All right.

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:20]** He ducks under the door.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:22]** Ducks under the door.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** Dude, what's up with this other door?

**[00:16:25 - 00:16:26]** That's what I want to know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:26 - 00:16:27]** Oh, there's another door in the room.

**[00:16:27 - 00:16:28]** I didn't notice that.

**[00:16:28 - 00:16:29]** So the door on the eastern wall, Dr.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:36]** O.K., you walk across the ground littered with laboratory and technical debris.

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:40]** There is a window on this door.

**[00:16:41 - 00:16:47]** And I recall when you guys first came down here or first looked in this room, you can see that outside...

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:56]** you do see some sort of greenery and I'll just reveal a little bit, Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:16:56 - 00:16:57]** Oh, that's okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** I remember you do see some greenery.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:07]** It seems like there's a lot, a lot, a lot of plant life of all different varieties that is, that is outside the store.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:08]** Yeah.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:17]** Um, I've played or seen fallout played and, uh, I would definitely be very perceptive before walking in something like that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:19]** I'll admit, I was a little confused.

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:24]** I thought the greenery was in this room, and then you talked about the swarm, so I thought the swarm was the greenery that we saw.

**[00:17:26 - 00:17:29]** My comprehension skills are limited.

**[00:17:30 - 00:17:31]** So what do you all do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:36]** Can I see what's going on out there?

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:37]** Can I hear anything?

**[00:17:37 - 00:17:40]** Can I perceive anything outside the door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:44]** Rick will walk up and also take a gander.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:46]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:46]** Yeah.

**[00:17:46 - 00:17:50]** Give me a perception check, Rick and Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:54]** I rolled a 12.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:55 - 00:18:01]** I rolled a 1 for a grand total of 13, which is still higher than Kevin's.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:01 - 00:18:05]** He's peeking over the shoulder of the two of them to try to get a look, and he rolls a 15.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:11]** You do notice that there appear to be bushes.

**[00:18:12 - 00:18:13]** Yeah, a lot of plant life.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** You can feel the heat on the window.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:19]** Maybe the room that you're in now is a little cold.

**[00:18:19 - 00:18:49]** definitely a lot warmer in there you can just barely make out sunlight yeah there are there are lights that seem to to stay on they must be maybe on a separate power or something they they are they are on they are intense grow lights built into the ceiling you see trees brush moss fungi and all over the floor you see vines and creepers you can just barely make out that those are on the walls and there's probably a stone wall on the other side of it

**[00:18:49 - 00:18:52]** And you also see these bushes.

**[00:18:54 - 00:19:02]** And in the bushes, you do see a strange red conical plant.

**[00:19:02 - 00:19:03]** And it seems to be directly in front of you.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:05]** There seems to be a lot of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:10]** Could I do a life science check?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:10 - 00:19:10]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:11 - 00:19:13]** If I know what it is.


## Speaker_0

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:15]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:16 - 00:19:18]** I'm really not great.

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:20]** I rolled a 2 for a 15 life size.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:20 - 00:19:22]** You don't know what this is.

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:24]** Hughes rolls a 17.

**[00:19:24 - 00:19:26]** You're not sure either.

**[00:19:27 - 00:19:32]** I will say, Dr. K, you recognize that all the plants and fungi here, they seem to be from everything.

**[00:19:32 - 00:19:35]** You're like, I think that's a plant native to Castroville.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:36]** It's from different places.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:39]** Yeah, I think there's one from Triaxis.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:49]** Perhaps this is someone's collection of samples for further modification.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:54]** This is like the seed bank or like maybe, I don't know.

**[00:19:55 - 00:19:56]** I don't know if we should go in or not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:57 - 00:20:00]** I have a feeling if we go in, we're going to be fighting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:01 - 00:20:07]** I suggest we open the door and get a better look, but be ready to close this door and walk away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:07 - 00:20:09]** That's a safe idea.

**[00:20:09 - 00:20:13]** Hey, should we grab our friend over there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:13 - 00:20:18]** I believe we would have time to contact him if it was dire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:27]** Okay, I'm just going to come over towards the door just in case you guys can have fun opening it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:29]** And I hear he actually goes behind this desk and peeks over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:32]** Yeah, Rick will be the one to punch it open.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:37]** As soon as they step behind, he's going to hit the door to open it up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:39 - 00:20:43]** Rick and Dr. O.K.

**[00:20:44 - 00:20:45]** step back in the room.

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:47]** Rick punches the door.

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:50]** I don't punch it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** I just push the button.

**[00:20:52 - 00:20:53]** Angrily open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:20:54 - 00:20:56]** Rick angrily opens the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:20:56 - 00:20:58]** He tries to kill the door.

**[00:20:59 - 00:20:59]** Like it owes him money.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:03]** Backhands it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:05]** Where's my money?

**[00:21:05 - 00:21:08]** I'm not going to murder you, but my gun might accidentally go off.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:12]** My gun might go off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** Hey, Hears touched it, then it shot.

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:15]** I'm just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:16 - 00:21:17]** Rick, Dr. Okay, and Hears.

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:20]** I'm going to need...

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:26]** All of you to give me a... Don't do it.

**[00:21:26 - 00:21:26]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** Oh, no.

**[00:21:29 - 00:21:30]** We'll save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:30 - 00:21:32]** Sad voice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:33 - 00:21:35]** We'll save.

**[00:21:35 - 00:21:36]** Rick passes.

**[00:21:37 - 00:21:38]** I think I passed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** I rolled an 11.

**[00:21:41 - 00:21:42]** Here's rolled an 11.

**[00:21:42 - 00:21:43]** Rick, what'd you get?

**[00:21:43 - 00:21:44]** And Dr. K, what'd you get?

**[00:21:44 - 00:21:45]** You didn't get pass.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:45]** You got a number.

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:46]** 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:47 - 00:21:48]** I also got a 22.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:50]** Oh, look at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:21:50 - 00:21:51]** Did you pass?

**[00:21:51 - 00:21:52]** I hope that passes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:53]** Twinsies.

**[00:21:53 - 00:21:55]** So you all see...

**[00:21:56 - 00:22:25]** these plants in the bushes maybe about 10 feet ahead and here's i think you see it and you're just like what is that no no and you're like i want to know what it is oh no it's oh my god towards it and here someone do something smart no we need to roll for initiative just just here's just here's no we all do you all just move move back


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** I did.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:26]** I did know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:22:27 - 00:22:28]** That's not what I wanted, cheater.

**[00:22:29 - 00:22:30]** Where are you?

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:34]** This is the most disgusting looking place that we've seen.

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:35]** This is like vines.

**[00:22:35 - 00:22:36]** Holy crap.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:37]** Roots everywhere.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:38]** There's freaking seven.

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:39]** Seven plants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:40 - 00:22:47]** It makes me think of the giant dead plant that they make travel around the world that only blooms every four years.

**[00:22:48 - 00:22:51]** And people still flock to see it, even though it smells like...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:53]** It's like death.

**[00:22:54 - 00:22:56]** The death plant or whatever it's called.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:22:57 - 00:22:58]** Alright, zombie plant.

**[00:22:58 - 00:22:58]** Zombie plant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:59 - 00:23:00]** Rick, what did you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:04]** Initiative is a plus four.

**[00:23:04 - 00:23:05]** I got ten total.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:07]** Nope, sorry, that's a nine.

**[00:23:08 - 00:23:08]** Thirteen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:09]** Thirteen.

**[00:23:09 - 00:23:11]** Dr. O'Kane, what'd you get?

**[00:23:11 - 00:23:12]** I got a fifteen.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:13]** Fifteen.

**[00:23:13 - 00:23:14]** Okay.

**[00:23:15 - 00:23:18]** And here's what did you get?

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:19]** Okay.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:20]** 15!

**[00:23:21 - 00:23:23]** Who has the higher initiative between Dr. K and yours?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:24 - 00:23:26]** I think I do, because I have a plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:28]** Yeah, Will takes it.

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:29]** I only have a plus zero.

**[00:23:29 - 00:23:31]** I have no modification.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:32]** Oh, wow.

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** Okay.

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:34]** He's got no dex bonus.

**[00:23:34 - 00:23:34]** No.

**[00:23:35 - 00:23:35]** Okay.

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:38]** You have 14.9 initiative here.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:44]** Well, I'd say he has 18.1, but, you know, this is how I do it.

**[00:23:44 - 00:23:46]** Okay, so it is going to be Dr. K's turn.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:48]** You see that

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:53]** But here's just Rick maybe looks around and looks back at you, Dr.

**[00:23:53 - 00:23:55]** O.K., like, yeah, this is just what we saw.

**[00:23:55 - 00:23:56]** But maybe you see, Dr.

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:03]** O.K., that here's just looks just totally enamored, not fascinated, totally enamored.

**[00:24:03 - 00:24:29]** with these plants uh i can i like is this is this like an effect that that like some sort of poison effect mind affecting poison uh you would definitely i want to know you would probably know by giving me another life science check and i'll let you do one kind of like yeah like each turn right or like just to see what it could be i don't know if this is gonna do it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:35]** I got a 14 plus... Four.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:36]** Why don't I know?

**[00:24:36 - 00:24:38]** Plus 13 for 27.

**[00:24:38 - 00:24:40]** 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:40 - 00:24:44]** Okay, this time, maybe before you were like... I don't know.

**[00:24:44 - 00:24:45]** I couldn't quite see, maybe.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:24:46 - 00:24:47]** Exactly.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:47]** You couldn't quite see it.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:50]** And then now, once the doors open, you're like, oh, I definitely see it.

**[00:24:51 - 00:24:58]** It does seem like these are part of the vracinea, the sentient carnivorous plant from Castroville.

**[00:24:58 - 00:25:00]** But these are not the plant.

**[00:25:01 - 00:25:02]** You're like, these bushes are not big enough.

**[00:25:03 - 00:25:04]** This doesn't look like it's the plant.

**[00:25:04 - 00:25:06]** They look like they're blooms.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:11]** Like maybe they've been modified to put here, to be grown here.

**[00:25:12 - 00:25:20]** You do recall that, one, they have this ability to fascinate.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:27]** And as soon as that door opened and that air hit you, it was less about like it's seeing them, yes.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:31]** But as soon as that door opened and you really took them in,

**[00:25:32 - 00:25:48]** then you had to roll that will save you do know that if you get close to them there is a paralytic toxin that they emit when you're near them so if you are wearing armor and you activate your environmental suit

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:58]** You'll be fine because as I was realizing the other day, you have to actually activate your environmental protections technically in order to use it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:25:58 - 00:26:02]** Hey, here's activate your environmental protection.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:02 - 00:26:07]** Here's – I'm just going to say that I think you probably hear what he's saying.

**[00:26:07 - 00:26:10]** Roll a check to see if you're – I don't have perception.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:11]** This is a –

**[00:26:11 - 00:26:17]** It's a mind-affecting effect, so I don't know whether you would maybe understand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:21]** Can I hit him with a pharmacological booster?

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:24]** I'm sorry, a minor booster?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** You attuned to your buttons.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** Yeah, so you can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:35]** Okay, so I administer a biohack to here's...

**[00:26:35 - 00:26:42]** And he should be able to get a plus four in his next saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:43 - 00:26:44]** Ooh, thank you.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:44]** That is awesome.

**[00:26:44 - 00:26:45]** Okay.

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:45]** All right.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:49]** Do you want to do anything else with your turn, Dr. O'Keefe?

**[00:26:49 - 00:26:51]** Because right now it just looks like he's...

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:52]** He's not moving.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:54]** He's like very focused on these things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:55]** Oh, wait.

**[00:26:55 - 00:26:55]** Okay.

**[00:26:56 - 00:27:00]** So I have to actually do a medicine check to treat drugs or poison.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:03]** Uh, and then you gain a plus four bonus on your next saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:05]** This is okay.

**[00:27:06 - 00:27:07]** Uh, yeah, that's fine.

**[00:27:07 - 00:27:09]** It's not a drug or a poison.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:13]** Do you have anything that, that helps affect mind affecting effects?

**[00:27:14 - 00:27:17]** Like, so how does this thing work mechanically?

**[00:27:17 - 00:27:20]** It seems like just by really seeing it, yeah.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:20]** Okay.

**[00:27:24 - 00:27:25]** I feel like you would, but I want to make sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:28]** Not that it matters, but I should have gotten a plus two to my save.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** You pass.

**[00:27:29 - 00:27:30]** Well, good.

**[00:27:30 - 00:27:31]** You were fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:32]** Surprised you're not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:32 - 00:27:32]** Just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:33 - 00:27:39]** It doesn't really say anything, but I feel like I'd still be able to help him on his next savings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:45]** I feel like you would, but if it explicitly calls out a drug or a poison, then eh.

**[00:27:46 - 00:27:51]** That's the condition that's making me worry because this is a mind-affecting effect.

**[00:27:51 - 00:27:53]** Now, if you were in range of the poison.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:27:53 - 00:27:54]** How does a mind affect?

**[00:27:55 - 00:27:57]** If it's not a drug or a poison, what is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:27:57 - 00:28:03]** It's a sonic or some kind of visual effect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:03 - 00:28:06]** Yeah, it's just seeing it with the door open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:06 - 00:28:07]** Rick waves his arms in front of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:09]** That's an interesting idea, just closing the door.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** Not to metagame, but you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:15]** I mean, that was my idea, but I'm low in initiative order, so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:18]** Hey, Rick, close that door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:19 - 00:28:20]** Thank you, Dr. O.K.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:22]** That was my intentions, but I have to wait six seconds.

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:23]** He just can't say anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:23 - 00:28:25]** He's just going to summarize.

**[00:28:25 - 00:28:27]** Here's, stay right there.

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:27]** Don't go anywhere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:27 - 00:28:28]** He's just drooling.

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:31]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:31]** Oh, my God.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:32]** Can I do really crap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:33]** Okay, Dr.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** O.K., that was your turn.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** Here's.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:41]** You must use two move actions to move your full speed towards the blue.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:41 - 00:28:41]** Wait, wait.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:42]** Come again?

**[00:28:43 - 00:28:43]** One more time?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:44 - 00:28:50]** I think you just start running towards... What the f***?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:51]** Wait, wait, wait.

**[00:28:51 - 00:28:52]** I get attack of opportunity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** Yeah, he does.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:55]** He's in front of the door.

**[00:28:55 - 00:28:57]** He can bull rush him.

**[00:28:57 - 00:28:58]** But you have to attack here.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:28:59 - 00:29:00]** Do you have a melee weapon?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:09]** Well, I have improved unarmed strike, so I can use my attack of opportunity even if I'm holding a weapon.

**[00:29:09 - 00:29:10]** You're going to grapple me?

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** Feel free to grapple.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:14]** I would like to do grapple, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:16]** Okay, so you need to hit his case.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** He's a slight guy.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** You could do it.

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:22]** What's your KAC here?

**[00:29:22 - 00:29:25]** My KAC plus eight is 21.

**[00:29:25 - 00:29:26]** Oh, my gosh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:26 - 00:29:27]** It's not going to work.

**[00:29:27 - 00:29:28]** It's not going to work.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:31]** So I use my combat maneuver, which is a plus five.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:33]** Yep.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:33]** Come on.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:34]** Come on.

**[00:29:34 - 00:29:35]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:35]** Natural 20.

**[00:29:35 - 00:29:36]** Come on, Kev.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:38]** Natural one.

**[00:29:38 - 00:29:41]** I rolled a four, so I have a nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:29:41 - 00:29:45]** Oh, he just gets by you as you realize what's going on.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:46]** You're like, oh, no.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** And he runs out.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:53]** I think you guys had your environmental conditions on.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** You have to activate them in increments of an hour.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:59]** I feel like within the past hour of time, you probably would have turned it on.

**[00:30:00 - 00:30:00]** That's my thought.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:01]** I don't know.

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:03]** I agree with this.

**[00:30:03 - 00:30:05]** At what point did it turn them on?

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:06]** There was no reason to turn them on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:07 - 00:30:10]** Yeah, that's what I'm thinking is that I don't know that you were able to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:13]** I don't think we're going to retcon that he wasn't wearing it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:14]** Yeah, I don't think so.

**[00:30:14 - 00:30:23]** So that means that it will take you, I think it's one standard action to turn on your environmental conditions if you are so inclined.

**[00:30:24 - 00:30:28]** And here's you need to give me a fortitude saving throw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:28 - 00:30:30]** But he gets a plus four.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:30]** Here we go.

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:32]** You do get a plus four.

**[00:30:32 - 00:30:34]** Fortitude saving throw.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** What is your fortitude save, Kelly?

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:36]** 22.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:36]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:38]** 22.

**[00:30:38 - 00:30:41]** You are able to stave it off.

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** But in your mind, you're just so fascinated.

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:50]** As you walk up to this creature that looks like a cone, but then as you get closer, you see that there's kind of these petals coming off of it.

**[00:30:50 - 00:30:51]** It's like triple layered.

**[00:30:51 - 00:30:54]** It looks really beautiful to you.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:54]** You're like, wow.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:55]** This is freaking awesome.

**[00:30:56 - 00:30:57]** And I will say that, Dr.

**[00:30:57 - 00:31:01]** O.K., you, again, remember that there is this poison effect.

**[00:31:01 - 00:31:02]** So just keep that in mind.

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:03]** It is a poison, then.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:07]** The effect when you're close in is a poison.

**[00:31:07 - 00:31:11]** The visual effect is a, we'll say, mind-affecting effect.

**[00:31:12 - 00:31:12]** Okay.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:19]** So, when that happens, Dr. K, you hear... Sorry, is everything all right out there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** Uh, no.

**[00:31:21 - 00:31:27]** Here's just went, uh, searching for trouble, unfortunately.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:30]** He went into the other room.

**[00:31:30 - 00:31:38]** Yeah, don't... You don't want to go in there, but it's got mind-affecting, uh...

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:44]** I don't know if you're in a condition to really handle that.

**[00:31:45 - 00:31:47]** Yeah, quite right about that.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** So, no, no.

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:50]** Just hang tight for a minute.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:51]** We're going to try and get him out.

**[00:31:52 - 00:31:53]** Just let me know, you fucking hell.

**[00:31:54 - 00:31:55]** Will do.

**[00:31:55 - 00:31:56]** Rick, what are you doing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:59]** Well, first, Will, did I give you back the incendiary grenade?

**[00:31:59 - 00:32:00]** I don't remember what happened with that.

**[00:32:01 - 00:32:03]** I feel like that would be really helpful.

**[00:32:03 - 00:32:03]** I don't know.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:08]** Um, but Rick remembers that Dr. O.K.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:09]** told him to shut the door and he follows directions.

**[00:32:09 - 00:32:10]** So he shuts the door.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:10]** I'm kidding.

**[00:32:10 - 00:32:13]** Um, man, I don't know what to do.

**[00:32:13 - 00:32:15]** Was here's inside.

**[00:32:15 - 00:32:19]** So here's walked past me into the room.

**[00:32:20 - 00:32:28]** Um, even if I do like a grapple move, which I'm not gonna be able to hit, uh, I wouldn't be able to like move him back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:28 - 00:32:34]** You do think that if you were to activate your things, you could go in there and not be affected.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:37]** So it's a move action to activate mine?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:43]** I think it's a standard action to activate any environmental protection on your ship.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:43 - 00:32:45]** Because, I mean, I only have two actions.

**[00:32:45 - 00:32:46]** So, like, I would do.

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:47]** Yeah.

**[00:32:48 - 00:32:48]** Well, no.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:49]** Nope.

**[00:32:49 - 00:32:49]** F*** it.

**[00:32:52 - 00:32:53]** Rick's got that plus two.

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:55]** He's going to risk it if he has to do another save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:56]** You're going to risk your biscuit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:32:56 - 00:32:56]** Okay.

**[00:32:57 - 00:32:59]** Rick is going to follow here into the room.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:03]** And from behind, push.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:04]** Close your eyes.

**[00:33:04 - 00:33:05]** I don't know.

**[00:33:05 - 00:33:06]** Is he wearing similar suits?

**[00:33:07 - 00:33:10]** Like, I guess he would just know like where to hit the button or do you want to roll?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:10 - 00:33:14]** Oh, if you want to push somebody else's, uh, you know, I did look this up.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:17]** You have to make a, uh, slide a hand check.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** No, it's not.

**[00:33:19 - 00:33:20]** No, it's not.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:20]** Uh, shoot.

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:21]** I was just looking this up.

**[00:33:22 - 00:33:24]** Environmental protections, star finder.

**[00:33:25 - 00:33:29]** Cause it's like to enable them on a creature that is, uh,

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:30]** That is not you.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:35]** You do have to, like, to deactivate it, I think, is a computer's check.

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:38]** To enable it, I think, is a full action.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:38]** Hold on.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:39]** Scroll and scroll and scroll.

**[00:33:39 - 00:33:39]** Armor.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** Armor size.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:42]** Activation duration.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:50]** If you have access to a suit that is unattended or worn by a helpless creature, I'm going to think you are.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:50]** Here's.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:55]** Then you can turn on its environmental protection as a full action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:56]** No!

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** That's bulls**t.

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:19]** alright now I gotta dig into the book and see what options I have okay so I have to wait till next turn to move him I'm gonna stay where I'm at cause I moved but or is it a full action to do all my things like are all combat feats full actions or no no they're standard actions but once you step in you do need to take a fortitude save

**[00:34:20 - 00:34:21]** Oh, they've got a 10-foot range?

**[00:34:21 - 00:34:22]** Yeah.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:24]** You need to take a 42 to say, fuck.

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** Bro.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:27]** I just got to the right page, too.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:30]** I wouldn't have gone in there like that.

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:32]** Because you didn't turn on your predictions, I think.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:32 - 00:34:33]** You're right.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:33]** You're right.

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** I did not.

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** I thought it would be another will save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:35 - 00:34:38]** Now I've got to rescue both your asses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:38]** Mm-hmm.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:41]** This is the problem with first responders.

**[00:34:41 - 00:34:43]** It's very, very common.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:44 - 00:34:46]** It's actually... You bring up a valid point, yeah.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:46]** You do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:34:47 - 00:34:56]** Yeah, there's a lot of cases of, like, especially, like, fallen power lines where, you know, somebody... People just keep... Yeah, four people dead in the field.

**[00:34:56 - 00:34:57]** Getting incapacitated.

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:59]** It's because nobody knows what's the problem.

**[00:34:59 - 00:35:00]** So you should always be cautious and call professionals.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:03]** Call professionals.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:06]** Don't touch a downed power line by yourself.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:07]** Fuck.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:31]** flat fx not going to help me um what was i looking up just now say fort save stuff yeah give me a 42 it's gonna protect me from fort save and i take it whatever it is i rolled a seven that's it flat seven yeah yeah i rolled two with a plus five as you step in and you're like thinking through your head what can i do what can i do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:31 - 00:35:36]** I don't know what you were deciding on, but maybe you think, all right, well, maybe if I move here, I do something.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:39]** And in your mind, you're like, all right, let me just move here.

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:41]** And you realize that you're paralyzed.

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:44]** Are you fucking kidding me?

**[00:35:44 - 00:35:47]** You're paralyzed for one round.

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:51]** We're back to the top of round two.

**[00:35:51 - 00:35:52]** It is Dr.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:52]** O.K.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:52]** 's turn.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:58]** Maybe you see Rick start to move and just freeze in the doorway.


## Speaker_0

**[00:35:59 - 00:35:59]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:00 - 00:36:04]** Well, I'm going to turn on my environmental protections.

**[00:36:05 - 00:36:07]** But I also have poison rejection as a feat.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** That's awesome.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:09]** That's good.

**[00:36:09 - 00:36:18]** I'm more confident than, oh, goodness, all these silly androids and Sheeran.

**[00:36:20 - 00:36:21]** Oh, goodness.

**[00:36:21 - 00:36:21]** I'm going in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:22 - 00:36:23]** You go in.

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:27]** I mean, there's not a mask on, but that's what I picture.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:28]** That's what I feel like I hear in my head.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:28 - 00:36:32]** If only combat feats were easier to accomplish.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:33 - 00:36:36]** I do love the idea that Hears just bolted and you were like, oh, wait, what?

**[00:36:36 - 00:36:38]** You tried to go after Hears.

**[00:36:38 - 00:36:39]** Yeah, and just pushed you.

**[00:36:39 - 00:36:40]** That's so cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:42 - 00:36:47]** And so, what's Hears' state exactly?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:50]** Hears is fascinated with this bloom.

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:51]** Okay.

**[00:36:51 - 00:36:53]** And not paralyzed.

**[00:36:54 - 00:36:57]** Like, you can see Hears kind of swaying, whereas Rick is just...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:57 - 00:37:19]** yeah stone uh so i'm going to try to administer i guess like first aid what do i do uh what are you trying to do i'm trying to rouse here's so that he's no longer under the effects of this thing oh uh tree disease i don't know


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:19 - 00:37:28]** Fun fact, if you're flying while paralyzed, if your flight is because of something such as wings, then you fall.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:32]** But if you're using like a jet pack, I guess you could stay technically aflight.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:33]** Yeah.

**[00:37:33 - 00:37:34]** Anyways, moving on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:36 - 00:37:38]** Uh, let me look up the fascinated condition.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:40]** Cause I want to see.

**[00:37:40 - 00:37:40]** I just did.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:42]** I mean, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:37:42 - 00:37:42]** Yeah.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** What does it say?

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:48]** Uh, so you got to either, you got to shake me.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:54]** It's like, you can take a, an action to do that, or you can aim a gun at me or a spell at me or something like that.

**[00:37:54 - 00:37:57]** Those are the ways you can add the condition automatically.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:57 - 00:37:58]** Okay.

**[00:37:59 - 00:38:00]** Uh, then I'll shake.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:02]** Here's a vigorous.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** It'd be like, Hey,

**[00:38:04 - 00:38:27]** here's put on your freaking environmental protections already okay doctors that you oh you shake him right yeah yeah okay but now you're shaking and now you're shaking now i draw the attention of all these plants that are about to pounce on us and here's you do snap out of it oh

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** Where am I?

**[00:38:30 - 00:38:32]** Put on your environmental protections.

**[00:38:33 - 00:38:34]** That's a whole turn, is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:34 - 00:38:36]** The android is like, I need oil.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:38 - 00:38:39]** You can't talk.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:40]** You can't move at all, right?

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:42]** You can only take mental actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:38:42 - 00:38:45]** I was making a Wizard of Oz joke.

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** Shut up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:46]** Yeah, I know.

**[00:38:46 - 00:38:48]** It wasn't funny, so I cut it off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:38:48 - 00:38:50]** Here's turns on the suit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:51 - 00:38:52]** Okay.

**[00:38:53 - 00:38:56]** It is your turn, unless Dr. K wanted to do anything else with your turn.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:56 - 00:38:57]** You're shaking it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:57 - 00:39:21]** nope just want to get us out of here and into the next room dr okay you uh yeah here's you it's your turn you turn on the environmental protection yeah can he also do anything else or is that all you can do when he's doing that you can give me a perception check as you're shaking tree okay um okay doing that now

**[00:39:21 - 00:39:41]** i don't know if you yeah okay wait what happened second uh 14 percent check 14 because you're right where you are there does seem to be something a figure or something the brush is pretty thick but next to your feet

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:54]** you notice a little bit, maybe as you step by, like you shake your head and you take a few steps in the same place and your foot hits something and you look down and you're like, what?

**[00:39:54 - 00:39:55]** There's something in the brush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:57 - 00:39:58]** Uh-huh.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:58]** Hears completely ignores it.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Hears, you got something there?

**[00:39:59 - 00:40:00]** Just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:01]** Right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:02]** Uh, okay.

**[00:40:02 - 00:40:06]** Well, Hears will... Hears is taking account of everything.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:09]** He doesn't yet notice that Rick is messed up, I guess.

**[00:40:10 - 00:40:11]** Is his environmental suit on?

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:12]** At this point.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:13]** Hears?

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:14]** Yeah, he turned it on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:14 - 00:40:15]** Yeah, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:15 - 00:40:16]** Because that's the standard action.

**[00:40:16 - 00:40:17]** Okay.

**[00:40:17 - 00:40:19]** Hears will investigate the... whatever the hell it is.

**[00:40:20 - 00:40:21]** In the bush.

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:21 - 00:40:24]** Maybe you turn and you look down.

**[00:40:26 - 00:40:27]** And...

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:32]** As you're about to kind of look down, I think we need to, that would be the end of your turn.

**[00:40:32 - 00:40:33]** He's being shaken free.

**[00:40:34 - 00:40:36]** And the environmental suit and everything.

**[00:40:37 - 00:40:41]** And you notice something that you don't know.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:42]** Yeah, you're like about to reach down.

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:43]** But Rick, what do you do?

**[00:40:43 - 00:40:44]** It's your turn.

**[00:40:44 - 00:40:45]** Am I no longer paralyzed?

**[00:40:45 - 00:40:49]** You need to make another fortitude save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:53]** Is he on the poison track or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:40:54 - 00:41:01]** No, it's just every round that I'm in the room, I have to do a 4-2 save until I can put on my damn suit.

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:02]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:02 - 00:41:03]** Ooh, 21.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:03]** 21.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:03]** Okay.

**[00:41:04 - 00:41:06]** Yeah, you are no longer paralyzed for a second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:06 - 00:41:07]** Yes!

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:13]** And I will take my standard action to turn on your suit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:22]** I kind of imagine it not like a force field in Halo, because there are force fields in Starfinder, but I do imagine it as if it's just like a thin... Like a second skin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:22 - 00:41:26]** I figured it was already on, but the HEPA filter's not engaged.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:26 - 00:41:27]** It's just like a bypass.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:31]** Well, because it protects against a lot of things, like radiation and temperature.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:34]** Okay, so you're able to do that, and the three of you wait for a second.

**[00:41:35 - 00:41:37]** There's no other round passes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:37 - 00:41:38]** Wait, I didn't finish my turn.

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:39]** What do you want to do?

**[00:41:39 - 00:41:40]** That was my standard action.

**[00:41:40 - 00:41:41]** I'm still going to move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:42 - 00:41:43]** What's your move action?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:43 - 00:41:45]** Did I also see what was in the bush?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:48]** You probably saw Hears look over at something in the bush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:41:49 - 00:41:50]** Step away.

**[00:41:51 - 00:41:55]** And Rick is actually going to step in between Hears and the bush.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:58]** And I'll do that as a guarded step.

**[00:41:58 - 00:42:00]** Not that that matters, but... Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:04]** You step over there, and I'm going to pull you guys out of combat.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:04]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:07]** So just for our listeners, there are seven of these conical things.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:09]** There's four of them off in the distance.

**[00:42:09 - 00:42:10]** There's three right in front of us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:14]** They look like demonic yucca plants.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:14 - 00:42:16]** Yeah, it's just like an orange cone sticking out.

**[00:42:17 - 00:42:19]** Yeah, and we're all, like, we're right next to these things.

**[00:42:19 - 00:42:24]** Here's literally one square over from the first conical plant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:27]** You can see that there are more of them up there.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:43]** around the room seems to start to loop around and there are more bushes and you can tell that there are likely now that you know what to look for you do see that there are more in the bushes to the north of the room but that's not your immediate concern

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** Great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:45 - 00:42:48]** They're like no longer a threat because we are wearing our environmental suits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** And you passed your checks.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:51]** Yeah.

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:57]** So every once in a while, you might feel the suits protect against the... The pheromone.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:58]** Yeah.

**[00:42:58 - 00:42:59]** Poison or whatever.

**[00:42:59 - 00:43:01]** Yeah, the poison.

**[00:43:02 - 00:43:03]** And you can try and figure that out later.

**[00:43:04 - 00:43:09]** But each time you look at them, for a brief second, maybe you do think like, wow, gosh, they're...

**[00:43:09 - 00:43:10]** why do they look so cool?

**[00:43:11 - 00:43:12]** And then, and then you're like, ah, they're nothing.

**[00:43:13 - 00:43:15]** It's like you, you feel it ping in the back of your head.

**[00:43:15 - 00:43:17]** Like you are almost like an itch.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:17]** Yeah.

**[00:43:17 - 00:43:19]** It's like an itch, but you've already scratched it.

**[00:43:19 - 00:43:19]** You've already been there.

**[00:43:22 - 00:43:26]** So Rick, as you're about to step forward, you do step.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:34]** And as you're about to step into that space and move the brush, your, your foot hits another part of this thing.

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:42]** And maybe you and Hears at the same time, you reach down and you start to pull the brush away.

**[00:43:43 - 00:43:46]** And Venny, what do we see?

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:46]** Wait, Venny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:43:47 - 00:43:47]** What?

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:48]** Venny?


## Speaker_0

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:49]** Venny?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:50]** What the heck?

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:50]** What?

**[00:43:50 - 00:43:59]** You see a humanoid creature in a skin suit, stiff with paralysis.

**[00:44:01 - 00:44:03]** Okay, they would notice it.

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:06]** There's a rather large angel emblem on the chest.

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:12]** You see eyes darting back and forth, but otherwise a completely motionless body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:14 - 00:44:35]** cares what they think of the bush i'm shocked by vinny being in the game hey hey how's it going vinny welcome to we'll say vinny what's up guys welcome all right let's take a pause for the game for half a second vinny um so you're a friend of john's give us a just a brief one minute elevator pitch of like who you are and how you relate to us and

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:46]** And he had mentioned some interest in adding a cast member.

**[00:44:46 - 00:44:57]** And, you know, I've got a pretty long background in audio production and in most things tech and in tabletop gameplay.

**[00:44:57 - 00:45:03]** And so obviously I was going to jump at the opportunity, play some games with you fine fellows.

**[00:45:03 - 00:45:05]** And here we find ourselves.

**[00:45:30 - 00:45:32]** What is an angel emblem?

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:35]** You're talking about like California, Los Angeles Angels?

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** No.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:38]** It's a Starfinder deity.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:39]** Oh.

**[00:45:39 - 00:45:41]** We'll have to do a story time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:42 - 00:45:43]** Story time.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:49]** It does appear that this human, humanoid, is paralyzed.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:50]** Their eyes are open.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** Is it a human?

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:54]** Did you find something over there, Rick?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:55 - 00:46:00]** There is a body here, and Rick, is it wearing an environmental suit?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:46:00 - 00:46:01]** A body or a person?

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:05]** Are they alive or dead?

**[00:46:05 - 00:46:06]** Should I look?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:13]** I can roll a medicine check for that, but first, let me just turn on its environmental suit if possible.

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:15]** Oh, I'm so excited to learn more.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:17]** The figure stands up.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:18]** Where am I?

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** Who are you people?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:54]** I think you got it.

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:56]** What is that emblem?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:58]** That emblem is the symbol of Sarenrae.

**[00:47:58 - 00:48:00]** I don't know what that means.

**[00:48:00 - 00:48:01]** Oh, I remember.

**[00:48:01 - 00:48:03]** We once prayed to Sarenrae.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:03 - 00:48:04]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:07]** As we do in our weekly prayer.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:10]** The Starfinder deity of healing and a couple of other things.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:12]** Oh.

**[00:48:12 - 00:48:19]** I shouldn't really help you out this time, but we'll call it a test, a trial.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:19 - 00:48:20]** I'm going to write that in the notes.

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:22]** Healing and other things.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:36]** there you go she sent us that's what happened Rick just notices that like as you walk past him and he's gonna kind of stay in the room as like the last guard type thing okay then you can control your token you should be able to yeah

**[00:48:36 - 00:48:38]** This is so cool.

**[00:48:38 - 00:48:41]** It's probably the opposite way that you should go.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:48:41 - 00:48:42]** You should go back this way.

**[00:48:43 - 00:48:44]** You stumble over the plants.

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** You stumble through the bush.

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:48]** He just goes up and guides him gently towards the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:48:48 - 00:48:50]** No, we walk out the room and shut the door.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:53]** This guy's not a part of our team.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:53]** Good luck.

**[00:48:54 - 00:48:55]** See ya.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** That's it.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:57]** That's Benny, everybody.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:05]** I'm really good at tech, but my computer works backwards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:11]** All right, so you walked back in with your newfound person.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:13]** Hey.

**[00:49:13 - 00:49:15]** You're back in this room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** Yeah, go ahead.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:15]** All right.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:16]** Hey, friend.

**[00:49:18 - 00:49:19]** What should we call you?

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:21]** What's the last thing you remember?

**[00:49:21 - 00:49:22]** I'm Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:22]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:24]** Lots of questions, Doctor.

**[00:49:26 - 00:49:30]** My name is Colin from Colin Edenbrand.

**[00:49:31 - 00:49:40]** My last memory before waking up in that bush was on Agaton on a humanitarian mission.

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:45]** We were there to heal some locals who'd been terrorized by a monster.

**[00:49:45 - 00:49:46]** They couldn't heal themselves.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:51]** We were getting ready to leave for a mission and the next thing I know I woke up in a bush.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:54]** Where on Akiton did this occur?

**[00:49:58 - 00:49:58]** Oh, dang it.

**[00:49:58 - 00:50:00]** Sorry if you weren't prepared for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:01 - 00:50:02]** No, I wasn't.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:09]** I was somewhere on Akiton in the northern regions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:10]** Maybe you don't remember.

**[00:50:10 - 00:50:12]** Yeah, you're probably pretty worn out from that whole experience.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:14]** It was in an undisclosed location.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:15]** I'm bad at geography, too.

**[00:50:15 - 00:50:18]** Rick has a serious interest in that statement, but...

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:23]** He's going to say, my name is Rick 19.

**[00:50:26 - 00:50:31]** This group, we have been captured by greys.

**[00:50:31 - 00:50:34]** They have been using us as experiments and we are trying to escape.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:35 - 00:50:36]** The little buggers exist?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:38]** They are very real.

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:41]** We killed at least one of them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:43]** You see the panic cross his eyes.

**[00:50:45 - 00:50:46]** I guess we've got the total order.

**[00:50:48 - 00:50:49]** What do we do next?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:51]** Do you have a friend over here?

**[00:50:51 - 00:50:54]** Let us introduce you to him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:57]** Yeah, this massive Akesti walks in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:50:57 - 00:50:59]** If you've been to Akiton, you should know exactly what this thing is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:59 - 00:51:00]** My goodness.

**[00:51:00 - 00:51:04]** Yeah, you definitely would recognize this as an Akesti.

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:08]** And just from the size and everything, it's clear that it's an Akesti Rivener.

**[00:51:09 - 00:51:13]** And maybe for a second, you're like, your heart stops in your throat.

**[00:51:13 - 00:51:15]** And then this big hand.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:17]** Oi, I'm broke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** Hello, Grog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** I'm calling.

**[00:51:20 - 00:51:21]** Grog.

**[00:51:21 - 00:51:22]** Grog.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:22]** Grog.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** I'm Grog.

**[00:51:24 - 00:51:24]** Grog.

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:25]** Grog.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:51:26 - 00:51:26]** Grog.

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:30 - 00:51:31]** Grog.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:32]** Cool.

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** Well, that was great.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** Now that we've got that settled.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** Are you okay?

**[00:51:40 - 00:51:41]** Do you need any medical attention?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:51:42 - 00:51:44]** Yeah, can I help you in anything?

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:45]** Do you need something to relax?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:48]** I love that line.

**[00:51:50 - 00:51:51]** Oh, goodness.

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:54]** No, I could ask you the same question.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** Are you a bit worse for wear?

**[00:51:56 - 00:52:00]** Anything I can do for you guys before we move on with the escape plan?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:05]** Sorry, you said your name was Colin?

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:06]** Aye.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:07 - 00:52:08]** No, it's Colin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:09 - 00:52:10]** Colon?

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:12]** No, colon.

**[00:52:12 - 00:52:13]** Colon?

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** Colon?

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:16]** No, colon.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** Close enough.

**[00:52:19 - 00:52:20]** How did you get here?

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** I wish I knew.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:29]** Oh, wait did I hear you say that you're from Akiton?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:32]** I came here from Akiton.

**[00:52:32 - 00:52:34]** I hail from Absalom Station.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:34 - 00:52:35]** Give me a culture check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:37]** Vinny.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Culture check.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:39]** Oh, my God.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** I just love hearing Vinny.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:42]** Sorry.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** No offense, Vinny.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:43]** Nothing weird.

**[00:52:44 - 00:52:45]** It's just nice to have, like, a new member.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:46]** Hey.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:47]** That's a 19.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:50 - 00:53:01]** You can tell, and maybe one of the other new party members can tell you, you definitely recognize this, Akeshi's face.

**[00:53:01 - 00:53:30]** from this particular it has to be like tv yeah yeah you definitely recognize this particular custody like when you see somebody that that is an actor but you can't or an actress but you can't remember who they are you're like why do i know you you're like did i meet you somewhere or like are you on tv like i think tv i think something like that you might recognize he's a sports figure yeah yeah i'm scrolling back in my sorry he uh he was a gladiator for a bit yeah right


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:31 - 00:53:37]** Yeah, so I was gladiator for a bit.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** And now he's going to help us kill a troll.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:41]** You're that wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:43]** It's a pleasure to meet you.

**[00:53:44 - 00:53:47]** He grabs his hand and shakes it really, really fast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:54]** Yeah, I think, like, you shaking the hand is just slightly moving his big hand a little bit.

**[00:53:54 - 00:53:58]** Yeah, it's good to meet you, too.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:00]** Know that troll.

**[00:54:01 - 00:54:02]** As soon as you say troll, Dr.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:04]** O.K., he's like, oh, the troll.


## Speaker_0

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:06]** Oh, the troll.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:06]** Horror girl.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:54:07 - 00:54:08]** Yeah, we gotta get rid of them, Rog.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:09]** Don't worry.

**[00:54:09 - 00:54:11]** We got more people now, too.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:11]** Look at that.

**[00:54:11 - 00:54:16]** Oh, I'm worried about that troll, but Cologne, it's good to meet you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:17 - 00:54:19]** I guess we need to update you on our plan.

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:22]** Right now, the stewards have contacted us.

**[00:54:22 - 00:54:29]** There are two reactors, and each of them are going to quote-unquote sanitize this area.

**[00:54:30 - 00:54:32]** We need to shut it down before that happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** From the flaring pan into the fire, eh?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:37]** Oh, it gets better.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:48]** Frog here has described a giant magical troll, and that seems to correlate with some of the information we have found.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:54:49 - 00:54:50]** Two heads.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:51]** Two.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:52]** Two heads?

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** Two heads.

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:53]** Yeah.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** Terrifying beast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** It sounds like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:58 - 00:54:59]** Are you willing to join us?

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** Otherwise, we can come back for you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:04]** I would never leave you alone.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:09]** If I can be of any service, I'm happy to be here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:13]** He's just going to roll a sense motive on Cullen.

**[00:55:13 - 00:55:15]** It just makes sense too.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:17]** We've been, here's his thinking to himself.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:20]** We've encountered all kinds of, you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:20 - 00:55:21]** That's true.

**[00:55:21 - 00:55:28]** I guess Rick's a little just offsetting because this thing was like, it could be a trap, but yeah, this guy was on the ground and paralyzed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:31]** But like seeing a similar serenade, maybe for Rick, you're like,

**[00:55:32 - 00:55:34]** Uh, I feel like I would know that.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:34]** Yeah.

**[00:55:34 - 00:55:35]** Like, right.

**[00:55:36 - 00:55:37]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:38]** Yeah.

**[00:55:38 - 00:55:39]** I don't know.

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:42]** Here's only rolled an 11 though.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** Okay.

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:43]** Dr. Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:45 - 00:55:50]** Uh, I rolled a 18 plus nine for 27.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:50 - 00:55:57]** I mean, I think Colin seems like he is what he said he is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:57 - 00:55:59]** Do you want to add anything to that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:59 - 00:55:59]** No, it's genuine.

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:00]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:24]** sounds fine to me here's his eyes not that they can do this but if they could they would narrow and he would be like okie dokie lokie and then we're gonna get off of this station and if you're game and you help us then that'd be a good deal we can help you out too what do you say


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:25 - 00:56:27]** Let's all try not to die together.

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:29]** I'm particularly good at helping people not die.

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:32]** I'm very good at not dying.

**[00:56:32 - 00:56:33]** I'm very good at it.

**[00:56:35 - 00:56:37]** That's right, big guy.

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:42]** I think that's why Yarisa and her wisdom brought us here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:49]** As we're having this conversation, Rick realizes Harag hasn't done any kind of checks, so he reaches back and shuts the door.

**[00:56:50 - 00:57:16]** luckily frog is facing the other way on world war one so yeah harag's not wearing any kind of environmental suit either is he he is not he is not well i told him not to go in there let's just say he didn't look in to see what was going on it's fine it's fine he's very very short-sighted he has bad vision

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:18]** Yeah, he's like 20-50 vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:22]** So, we should find this reactor, right?

**[00:57:22 - 00:57:23]** Should we?

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** Frog, can you lead the way?

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:26]** Let's get moving, yeah?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:28]** Yeah, do you know where it is, Frog?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:31]** Oh, I think it's over there.

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:38]** And points back through the window, obviously, to the northwest side of the map.

**[00:57:38 - 00:57:39]** Nope, over here.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:41]** Oh, boom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** Alrighty.

**[00:57:42 - 00:57:46]** In the room above us, are there any doors besides the ones that are on the floor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:49]** Uh, there is a door here to the east.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:52]** I said, okay, I guess it's a part of the room above you.

**[00:57:52 - 00:57:54]** No, no, there's no other door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:57:54 - 00:57:54]** All right.

**[00:57:55 - 00:57:55]** Okay.

**[00:57:55 - 00:58:07]** Uh, Rick will walk up and enter that room and head to, I'll let you clear it first, but, um, yeah, where that door is, that means there's two doors that lead into the green house area that we were just in.

**[00:58:08 - 00:58:11]** Um, so entering into that room, cause I assume that's the way around, um,

**[00:58:11 - 00:58:13]** Yeah.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:14]** Okay.

**[00:58:14 - 00:58:16]** So Hrag rocks ahead.

**[00:58:16 - 00:58:17]** Oh, Hrag's going to lead the way?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:19 - 00:58:21]** Well, he starts to walk into that room.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:24]** What do... But then, Rick, you step in front of him?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:28]** I mean, Hrag wasn't moving, so I'm just taking initiative.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:31]** I'll move out of the way if Hrag wants to walk forward.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:32 - 00:58:35]** If you want to lead the way, Hrag...

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:36]** I'm game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:40]** Yeah, well, Frog walks up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:58:41 - 00:58:49]** All right, so I'm a little worried because I don't know what's out there.

**[00:58:50 - 00:58:52]** Wait, out in this greenery?

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:57]** Yeah, I've seen strange things out there.

**[00:58:57 - 00:59:17]** yeah we should you probably shouldn't go out there uh because you don't have any environmental protections i don't know if i can make it then i don't know i don't think is there a door here no there's no door there so how do we get over here if there's no doors along the north side is uh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:43]** way to go through the plans you presume it seems like it wraps around is is there a way for colin to see which sense these plants are using to paralyze i would say give me a life science check or dr okay can also fill you in if you want to ask maybe because this is what affected you and yeah it's just a plot on our trick so we don't get wrong to help us that's a 21

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:53]** Yeah, I mean, you definitely recognize that these would, by visual sight, like when the door is open, then they do seem alluring and they want to pull you in and you're fascinated.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:58]** And then as soon as you're within 10 feet of them, then you do breathe in this poison.

**[00:59:59 - 01:00:02]** Recall, though, that once you make these checks, you don't...

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:06]** you are immune to them for 24 hours.

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:09]** You would know this, Dr. Roke.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:13]** Dr. Roke, do you have that incendiary device, or am I remembering that wrong?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:17]** I mean, I don't have it on my character sheet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:17 - 01:00:18]** I remember the conversation.

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:19]** I had it.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:22]** You might have used it as a trap at some point.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:22]** I don't remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:28]** I only have... Here's what we're going to say.

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:28]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:28 - 01:00:31]** Here's how the olfactory knows on him.

**[01:00:31 - 01:00:36]** If we attach this to Frog, will Frog be able to breathe exclusively through that and avoid this poison?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:36 - 01:00:37]** Possibly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:37 - 01:00:40]** But he'll have terrible memories and it'll kill us all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:00:40 - 01:00:42]** Could he check, though?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:43 - 01:00:44]** You would have to put it on him now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:00:44 - 01:00:47]** Don't do that, because it's got the better memory thing.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:50]** He's going to remember being a Rivner and kill us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:50 - 01:00:51]** Call him.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:51 - 01:00:56]** Krog, this is going to sound like a weird request.

**[01:00:57 - 01:01:02]** How would you feel about wearing a blindfold and maybe holding your breath for the minute or two?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:03]** Yeah.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:03]** Yeah.

**[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]** Smart man.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:21]** So, can Bernice be with me?

**[01:01:48 - 01:01:50]** You can just close his eyes.

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:52]** Yeah, I don't have anything.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:55]** Although, it's probably better to... Yeah.

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:55]** For what?

**[01:01:55 - 01:01:56]** To what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02
