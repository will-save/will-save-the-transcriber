## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:00:02 - 00:00:05]** Last time on We'll Save.

**[00:00:07 - 00:00:20]** Everything, every challenge, and every person our group has encountered thus far was revealed to be part of an elaborate hoax.

**[00:00:22 - 00:00:25]** Whose hoax it is remains to be determined.

**[00:00:26 - 00:00:45]** All we know is that Lozu suddenly dropped dead, our crew made a desperate dash to the escape pods, and then jettisoned out into an elaborate test chamber simulating a ship in space.

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:50]** Now our crew is stuck.

**[00:00:50 - 00:00:58]** with the very real consequence, uncertainty, and impending danger still to come.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:02]** Where are our adventurers?

**[00:01:04 - 00:01:05]** What is even real?

**[00:01:06 - 00:01:10]** Find out this time, on We'll Save.


## Speaker_0

**[00:01:13 - 00:01:13]** We'll Save


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:05]** Well, thank you, everybody, for listening, and welcome back.

**[00:02:05 - 00:02:05]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:12]** Welcome back to, I think there was a week in which you heard us talking about the end of Book 1.

**[00:02:12 - 00:02:22]** For folks who are just, this is your first foray into Starfinder, maybe you've never played or GMed, the adventure paths from Paizo are split up into three or six books.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:23 - 00:02:24]** Is it always three or six?

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:26]** There's not like a four or five in there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:26 - 00:02:27]** Yeah, no, it's always three or six.

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:27]** I did not know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:27 - 00:02:28]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:28]** Fun facts.

**[00:02:28 - 00:02:30]** Yeah, fun facts from Paizo.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:31]** It's always a three-act play.

**[00:02:32 - 00:02:34]** Yeah, or a three-act with two chapters per act.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** Yes.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:37]** So we finished the first chapter.

**[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]** End of book one right now.

**[00:02:39 - 00:02:46]** They are looking at a glitching GIF of space that says end of book one on the TV screen.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:46]** Sorry, GIF.

**[00:02:46 - 00:02:47]** I always forget.

**[00:02:47 - 00:02:48]** So it's not peanut butter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:49]** No, it's not GIF-y.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:54]** Hard G. Except Jeff, the creator, I think he says Jeff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:02:54 - 00:02:55]** Does he?

**[00:02:55 - 00:02:56]** I think he does.

**[00:02:56 - 00:02:56]** He does.

**[00:02:57 - 00:02:58]** Is it Jeff with a J or Jeff with a G?

**[00:02:58 - 00:02:59]** G. G.

**[00:02:59 - 00:02:59]** Oh, that's why.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:00]** That's why.

**[00:03:00 - 00:03:01]** Gift, gift.

**[00:03:01 - 00:03:03]** If you don't want me to be miffed, let's go.

**[00:03:03 - 00:03:03]** Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:04 - 00:03:11]** Okay, this is something I think we kind of phased out on it, but I think we all reset to zeros on punishments.

**[00:03:11 - 00:03:12]** Bring it back.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:12]** That's fair.

**[00:03:12 - 00:03:16]** I'm just going to argue that we should probably switch it to advantage, though.

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:17]** Because, like, a plus one is kind of weak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:03:17 - 00:03:21]** Well, we can't use that word because I think the door, I heard a knock.

**[00:03:21 - 00:03:23]** That was Dungeons and Dragons.

**[00:03:23 - 00:03:24]** They were like, hey, you can't use advantage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:28]** Okay, well, find a synonym for advantage.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:28]** Side.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:29]** Wait, Nico.

**[00:03:29 - 00:03:30]** Nicolette.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:30]** Damn it.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** Whatever.

**[00:03:31 - 00:03:35]** Anyway, you got lots of punishments, but did you use them at all?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** I used them.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** I used the punishment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:37 - 00:03:38]** No, Nick never got them.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:41]** He always had such great puns, and we never once said, like,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:45]** Well, I still have never gotten one, ever.

**[00:03:45 - 00:03:46]** And it's time.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:03:47 - 00:03:51]** I've tried to set you up with those so many times, too.

**[00:03:51 - 00:03:53]** No, Nick's got some really good puns in there.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:57]** I don't think all of us ignore him all the time because he's always saying something.

**[00:03:57 - 00:03:58]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:03:58 - 00:04:01]** Or some sort of pre-gap reference.

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:05]** If you feel it warrants a pun, tell us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:04:05 - 00:04:07]** I've been telling you.

**[00:04:07 - 00:04:09]** Oh, and then we're just like, ha-ha, classic Nick.

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:10]** You know how I do it?

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:10]** Ha-ha, move on.

**[00:04:10 - 00:04:12]** You want to know how this happens?

**[00:04:12 - 00:04:15]** It's just kind of like, oh, I'm getting nothing for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:04:15 - 00:04:16]** Ah, yeah, that's maybe.

**[00:04:16 - 00:04:18]** I'll have to listen again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:04:18 - 00:04:23]** I think we've talked about this before, but Will is a beer connoisseur, and he has literally a fridge full of beers.

**[00:04:23 - 00:04:25]** We should probably get that picture up on Instagram at some point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:26]** Yeah, I agree.

**[00:04:26 - 00:04:28]** I want to see everybody else's beers.

**[00:04:29 - 00:04:30]** I usually have like six beers.

**[00:04:30 - 00:04:33]** When this episode airs, I will...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:04:33 - 00:05:03]** tweet a picture of my fridge and i want to see what everybody else has got rolling oh that'd be fair we want everybody that's listening to put their their beer fridges up yeah or just your wine cabinet whatever you want so there's something important that happened uh last time and that was that you all hit level three we did level three so who wants to go first


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:30]** i'll take it um so i just did another level in soldier straightforward simple you know straightforward uh nothing too exciting but i did take what i think will be very helpful is improved unarmed strike which what it does for me specifically is i can then get uh attack of opportunities while holding a weapon i can use my feet or head in order to attack so i get that advantage that

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:44]** pretty great yeah i think that's great indeed um and i just for i forget if i had any other advantages um for my level three because i think i did it right after the last episode it's been a little while yeah and i have a crap memory so let's just move on okay who


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:05:45 - 00:05:46]** It's next.

**[00:05:46 - 00:05:47]** I'll go next.

**[00:05:47 - 00:05:50]** So I upgraded my Technomancer's Boar.

**[00:05:50 - 00:05:56]** I got a spell called Overheat, where you just suck in energy from bodies and devices.

**[00:05:56 - 00:05:58]** It's like a thermal wave of attack.

**[00:05:58 - 00:06:00]** I also learned Kasatha.

**[00:06:00 - 00:06:02]** The language of the Kasafin race.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:02 - 00:06:03]** Oh, sorry, wait.

**[00:06:03 - 00:06:05]** I have to go back on that one because I took a language too.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:07]** Oh, did you?

**[00:06:07 - 00:06:10]** The language that was on the relic.

**[00:06:11 - 00:06:13]** I believe I took that as language.

**[00:06:15 - 00:06:16]** Not Akitani.

**[00:06:17 - 00:06:17]** Aklo.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** Was that correct?

**[00:06:19 - 00:06:22]** So I learned Aklo by studying the relic as a robot.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:23]** I can do that.

**[00:06:23 - 00:06:24]** That's pretty dope.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** Correction, as an android.

**[00:06:25 - 00:06:26]** As an android, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:27]** That's smart.

**[00:06:27 - 00:06:28]** That's actually really smart to do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:06:29 - 00:06:31]** Remind me to go review that relic before I forget.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:06:31 - 00:06:32]** All right, for sure.

**[00:06:33 - 00:06:41]** The other thing I'll mention is that I got Fleet, which means I can just move an extra 10 feet during battles.

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:42]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:42 - 00:06:44]** Fleet, F-L-E-E-T?

**[00:06:44 - 00:06:45]** Yes.

**[00:06:45 - 00:06:46]** That's cool.

**[00:06:46 - 00:06:47]** That's cool.

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:49]** Who wants to go next?

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** Dr.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:50]** O.K.?

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:52]** Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:52 - 00:06:53]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:57]** just took a level in biohacker again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:06:58 - 00:06:59]** Again?

**[00:06:59 - 00:06:59]** Just another level.

**[00:06:59 - 00:07:02]** Is there anything cool that happens at third level?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:03]** Hack more bios?

**[00:07:03 - 00:07:17]** I get a spark of ingenuity once a day, weapon specialization, and I took a feat that improved my roles in life science and medicine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:18 - 00:07:18]** Nice.

**[00:07:19 - 00:07:21]** So basically, all things that just make you more dangerous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:25]** Yeah, I'm trying to OP my skills in one sector.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:28]** Oh, I actually went the opposite approach.

**[00:07:28 - 00:07:31]** I started putting them into other things so that I could at least help.

**[00:07:31 - 00:07:36]** When there's a medicine check, I can now at least provide... What's it called?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:36 - 00:07:41]** But medicine's checkers are really hard, and so I wanted to power it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:44]** Well, I know, but with that extra plus two from my support...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:44]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:45]** Just saying.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:07:45 - 00:07:47]** And now you're more likely to support.

**[00:07:47 - 00:07:48]** The word's assistive.

**[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]** Yes, I believe that's the technical.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:51]** Yeah.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:55]** I mostly double down on my stuff, but I did take a few extra things to help assist as well.

**[00:07:55 - 00:07:55]** Yeah.

**[00:07:56 - 00:07:57]** That's smart.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:57]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:07:58 - 00:08:00]** What about you, Mr. Orion?

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:11]** I took another level in operative, but the feats I did are the... So for my operative...

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:11]** feat.

**[00:08:12 - 00:08:13]** It's not really an operative feat.

**[00:08:13 - 00:08:16]** It's called a... What's that thing called?

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:16]** I'm so sorry.

**[00:08:16 - 00:08:17]** I should have had this together.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:19]** It's all good.

**[00:08:19 - 00:08:23]** Level 3 operative gets an... Come on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** Take your time, Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]** It gets something that's really cool.

**[00:08:28 - 00:08:30]** Something that's really, really cool.

**[00:08:31 - 00:08:34]** It's a... Should we... Special abilities.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** Exploits.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** Why didn't I think of that?

**[00:08:36 - 00:08:37]** Exploits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:38 - 00:08:39]** Operative exploits.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:08:39 - 00:08:39]** Yeah.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:40]** Yeah.

**[00:08:40 - 00:08:41]** It's good.

**[00:08:41 - 00:08:54]** So I took an operative exploit called... I think it was combat expert... No, it's not combat expertise, but... It's called...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:08:56 - 00:09:00]** Guys, since our podcast has kind of pulled over off to a stop here, we're just hanging out.

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:02]** If you guys want to get out, I'm going to stretch your legs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:07]** Just kind of stretch while we wait.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:10]** I'm just going to take in the view.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:10]** Oh, wait.

**[00:09:10 - 00:09:10]** Hold on.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:11]** Hold on.

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** The car's starting.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:21]** Sorry, I need to review my stuff too, but I got a gear boost, and my gear boost is that I get a plus one to my KAC whenever I'm wearing armor.

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:22]** Nice.

**[00:09:22 - 00:09:25]** I'm always wearing armor, because that's silly if you don't.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:09:25 - 00:09:27]** Well, sometimes some people... Like when you sleep?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:09:28 - 00:09:29]** I guess you don't sleep.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Yeah, no, I don't sleep.

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:31]** I'm an android.

**[00:09:31 - 00:09:34]** The operative exploit that I took was called Combat Trick.

**[00:09:34 - 00:09:36]** You gain a bonus feat.

**[00:09:36 - 00:09:36]** Nice.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:41]** Yeah, you gain a bonus feat, and the feat that I took...

**[00:09:42 - 00:09:55]** for that one was um oh it was weapon specialization and small arms and then I also got a feat this last level too and I took it with double tap

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:58]** Ooh, double tap sounds nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** Ooh, double tap.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:01]** Is that your new nickname, double tap?

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** Double tap.

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** Quick fire, double tap.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:04]** Slingshot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:04 - 00:10:05]** Engaged.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** Engaged.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:07 - 00:10:08]** Spaghetti Western.

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:10]** Rick, I have a follow-up question.

**[00:10:11 - 00:10:13]** So if you don't sleep, what do you do?

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:13]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:14]** I have to read.

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:14]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:14 - 00:10:15]** I'd have to read the book again.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** Do you, like, charge?

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:20]** Do you dream of electric sheep?

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:20]** Is it USB-C?

**[00:10:20 - 00:10:22]** Do you murder someone?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:22 - 00:10:26]** No, I'm not a murder bot!

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:28]** Do you murder the organs of small children?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:31]** He keeps a bag of squirrels that he just punches to death.

**[00:10:32 - 00:10:33]** I've been reading a lot of horror lately.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:33 - 00:10:35]** Says the Delta Green Handler.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:37]** Big 19, there are too many of them.

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:39]** What are we going to do?


## Speaker_0

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:39]** Help!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:40]** Wow.

**[00:10:40 - 00:10:41]** All right.

**[00:10:41 - 00:10:43]** Rick 19 kills younglings.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:44]** It's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:49]** Just to rewind a little bit, though.

**[00:10:49 - 00:10:55]** Nico's the one that just randomly killed a goblin that was tied up on the ground.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:10:55 - 00:10:56]** He was going to get a liability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:10:56 - 00:11:00]** We had a room with three unconscious people, and he's like, don't worry, I'll take care of it.

**[00:11:00 - 00:11:01]** Liabilities.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:02]** That's still murder!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:02 - 00:11:03]** That is murder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:03 - 00:11:04]** It's still murder!

**[00:11:04 - 00:11:05]** I think it's libel.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:09]** And I do agree it's murder, but democracy spoke, and Rick is the murder dog.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:10]** Democracy spoke.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:11]** We put a poll on Twitter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:11 - 00:11:13]** Yeah, this was a while back.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:14]** We had a poll up a while back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** Did you want to drag them through the fire and the gas?

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** I don't.

**[00:11:19 - 00:11:21]** Well, we'll have another poll up probably this week.

**[00:11:21 - 00:11:23]** Yeah, about who is the real murderer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:25]** Now that you've heard all of book one.

**[00:11:25 - 00:11:29]** Now that you've heard Nico Orion's murderous photos.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:11:30 - 00:11:34]** Thank you, Will, for supporting me that Nico's the most murderous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:11:34 - 00:11:35]** Kevin seeks vindication.

**[00:11:36 - 00:11:37]** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:11:37 - 00:11:38]** Nico's a murderous human.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** You know, we can always just do the poll again.

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:41]** Yeah, let's do it again.

**[00:11:41 - 00:11:42]** Hey, so I got to ask.

**[00:11:43 - 00:11:45]** You guys want to start book two?

**[00:11:45 - 00:11:47]** Yeah, let's do it!

**[00:11:47 - 00:11:48]** Book two!

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** Nick's very hesitant.

**[00:11:50 - 00:11:50]** Nick is not sure.

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** Nick, there's still time if you just want to leave.

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:54]** I think we had a great run.

**[00:11:54 - 00:11:55]** Thanks, Nick.

**[00:11:56 - 00:11:58]** You'll find out what happens to Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** This is not you.

**[00:12:00 - 00:12:02]** I'm just saying in general, we've got a great run.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:03]** Why do we even have to go to about two?

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:03]** Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:03 - 00:12:05]** We can just end it there.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:05]** Yeah, sounds good.

**[00:12:05 - 00:12:06]** This is it.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:08]** We're getting canceled.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:08]** Yeah.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:09]** The network just called.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** I just got off the phone.

**[00:12:11 - 00:12:12]** We're canceling ourselves.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:12]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** This is the network.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:15]** Do we need to bring an outside investment?

**[00:12:15 - 00:12:17]** How much of a gap do we have?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** Yeah, we're a little short.

**[00:12:18 - 00:12:19]** We can talk about that.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:20]** Yeah, we'll figure it out.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:20]** We're a bit in the red.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:21]** It's okay.

**[00:12:21 - 00:12:22]** Just kidding.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** No, it's fine.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** All right, so here's the thing.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:25]** No, it's fine.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** We actually are.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:28]** This is the last episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:28 - 00:12:31]** We've got to sell Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:34]** We have to sell Nico's stake in order to stay afloat.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:36]** That's true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:36 - 00:12:38]** All of his stocks from his company.

**[00:12:38 - 00:12:41]** Do you still have your stock in your company, or are you just ousted from the board?

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:12:42 - 00:12:43]** Did you exercise your options?

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:44]** Like, what was the severance?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:12:45 - 00:12:50]** You know, when I created my character, I didn't think about whether or not he still had his stock options.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:54]** Sounds like you didn't get in the right CEO mindset.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** You know what?

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:56]** It makes sense that you were fired.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:59 - 00:12:59]** Kelly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:12:59 - 00:13:02]** This needs to stop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** It's not going to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:04]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:12]** I'm starting to think, actually, that, like, Nico just killed everybody on the board and then went on a run for himself.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Well, perhaps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:15]** Dude.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** Possible.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:24]** This is Rick19 again, just trying to build his campaign to make Rick19 not a murder bot again.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:25]** But you know what?

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:26]** He's a murder bot.

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:27]** You're right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:27 - 00:13:28]** Because he's the only bot.

**[00:13:29 - 00:13:30]** He's the only bot.

**[00:13:30 - 00:13:32]** And he acknowledges when he kills somebody.

**[00:13:32 - 00:13:35]** Where Nico's like, oh, it was just a liability.

**[00:13:36 - 00:13:37]** The whole board was a liability.

**[00:13:37 - 00:13:38]** My mom was a liability.

**[00:13:38 - 00:13:40]** My friend was a liability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:41]** Liability.

**[00:13:41 - 00:13:43]** That's how he sees the world.

**[00:13:43 - 00:13:44]** Assets and liability.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:44 - 00:13:45]** What's his name?

**[00:13:45 - 00:13:46]** What was his name, your friend?

**[00:13:46 - 00:13:49]** Tuco Nothings.

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:49]** Zen Tuco.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:49 - 00:13:50]** Zen Tuco.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:13:51 - 00:13:51]** Zen Tuco.

**[00:13:52 - 00:13:53]** Did you do it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:13:53 - 00:13:56]** He had it set up because he was shot from a distance.

**[00:13:56 - 00:13:57]** But, like, Nico had enough money.

**[00:13:57 - 00:13:58]** He could just hire somebody else to do it.

**[00:13:58 - 00:14:00]** Also, he's an engineer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:00 - 00:14:01]** He could have engineered some boxes and things.

**[00:14:01 - 00:14:02]** Like a Rick, maybe.

**[00:14:02 - 00:14:04]** He could have engineered Rick.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:04]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:05]** He could have hired Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:06 - 00:14:07]** Wait, wait.

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:07]** Do you remember?

**[00:14:07 - 00:14:10]** Rick just shot the distance.

**[00:14:10 - 00:14:11]** Oh, shit.

**[00:14:11 - 00:14:13]** Off a building.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:14]** Yeah.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:14]** Oh, my God.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:14]** Maybe.

**[00:14:14 - 00:14:17]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:19]** You did it, you son of a bitch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:14:19 - 00:14:21]** Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:14:21 - 00:14:23]** You thought you were collecting a bounty.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:23 - 00:14:25]** Oh, this is not good.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:29]** I'm having, like, PTSD on this one now.

**[00:14:29 - 00:14:33]** You just, like, hide in dark corners and I'm lawful good, I swear.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:34 - 00:14:35]** I'm lawful good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:40]** No, but the person that Rick shot in his flashback was a Vask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:41]** Oh, okay.

**[00:14:41 - 00:14:43]** And Zuko was a Vask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:43 - 00:14:44]** Oh, shit.

**[00:14:44 - 00:14:46]** And we're all in this weird simulation thing anyways.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:47 - 00:14:48]** That makes sense.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** I can see that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:50]** What ifs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:14:50 - 00:14:51]** What ifs.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:52]** All right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:14:52 - 00:14:54]** Murder, murder, murder, murder.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:14:54 - 00:14:56]** Well, there are a couple things we've got to do here.

**[00:14:56 - 00:14:59]** I definitely want to go over the whole thing.

**[00:14:59 - 00:15:04]** But before I do that, I want you guys to just pay attention to...

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:06]** The TV in the center of the room.

**[00:15:06 - 00:15:11]** Because since we're now moving on to, you know, book two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:15:11 - 00:15:12]** I like this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:15:12 - 00:15:17]** We need a new screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:17 - 00:15:18]** It looks amazing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:15:18 - 00:15:19]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:19 - 00:15:20]** That's you guys.

**[00:15:21 - 00:15:22]** Oh, man.

**[00:15:22 - 00:15:23]** John, you did this, right?

**[00:15:23 - 00:15:24]** I'm videoing this.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:26]** Dude, I am loving it, man.

**[00:15:26 - 00:15:26]** I am loving it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:15:27 - 00:15:27]** Gorgeous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:28 - 00:15:30]** For the listeners, it says three full conspiracy.

**[00:15:30 - 00:15:31]** I'm going to post it.

**[00:15:31 - 00:15:32]** Book two.

**[00:15:32 - 00:15:35]** And then it says player one, player two, player three, and player four.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** High score, though.

**[00:15:37 - 00:15:38]** Who's got the highest score?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:41]** Well, the high score, this is your landing screen.

**[00:15:41 - 00:15:44]** So your high score is going to be your combined high score of how many.

**[00:15:45 - 00:15:48]** I'm trying to decide whether it's kills or whether it's points of damage.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:50]** Because if it's kills, it's going to go to Nico.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:50]** That's true.

**[00:15:50 - 00:15:51]** Well, no, no, no.

**[00:15:51 - 00:15:52]** High score overall.

**[00:15:52 - 00:15:54]** So it could just be total damage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:15:54 - 00:15:58]** Do unnecessary kills count or are those liabilities and they don't count for scores?

**[00:15:59 - 00:15:59]** That's super true.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:15:59 - 00:16:00]** That's very true.

**[00:16:00 - 00:16:03]** Assets, liabilities.

**[00:16:05 - 00:16:07]** Nice.

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:07]** Nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:07 - 00:16:09]** Yeah, so you guys needed a new landing screen, so I thought this would be.

**[00:16:09 - 00:16:09]** I love it.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** That's beautiful.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:10]** Good job.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:11]** I mean, as much as I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:11 - 00:16:12]** It'll be good.

**[00:16:12 - 00:16:15]** You need a load screen, and you need options.

**[00:16:15 - 00:16:18]** Because, I mean, what if I need to adjust the graphics for my screen resolution?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:18 - 00:16:18]** Don't worry.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** There are options.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:20]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:20 - 00:16:22]** These are the droids you're looking for.

**[00:16:22 - 00:16:24]** These are the droids you're looking for.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:29]** So I thought it would be good if we do a little recap.

**[00:16:29 - 00:16:34]** And by a little recap, I mean... A big one?

**[00:16:34 - 00:16:35]** Yeah.

**[00:16:35 - 00:16:36]** A solid punch of a recap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:39]** Do you guys want me to do a live recap?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:39 - 00:16:41]** Are you going to read the text that I wrote?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:16:42 - 00:16:48]** I'll basically kind of come up with an on-the-spot recap of the notes taken from the last episode.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:50]** No, no, we're talking about all of book one.

**[00:16:51 - 00:16:52]** All of book one?

**[00:16:52 - 00:16:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:16:53 - 00:16:58]** Just like a good summary thing to get all of us back in, get the listeners back in.

**[00:16:59 - 00:17:00]** Sure, I can try that.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:02]** If you guys want me to, I'll just do it.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:03]** It's all good.

**[00:17:03 - 00:17:04]** Do you want me to give you the cue?

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:06]** I want you to give me the nod.

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:07]** You're the producer here.

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:10]** Oh, I was going to give you the last time on...

**[00:17:10 - 00:17:12]** Oh, that is the one.

**[00:17:12 - 00:17:13]** Oh, that is the one.

**[00:17:13 - 00:17:14]** I need that.

**[00:17:14 - 00:17:15]** I'm turning off the music for that.

**[00:17:15 - 00:17:16]** You don't have a drop of that already?

**[00:17:16 - 00:17:17]** Last time.

**[00:17:17 - 00:17:18]** I don't know what you're talking about.

**[00:17:18 - 00:17:19]** I'll throw in a drop.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:17:19 - 00:17:22]** Last time on We'll Save.

**[00:17:22 - 00:17:24]** The last time on We'll Save.

**[00:17:25 - 00:17:26]** Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:17:29 - 00:17:32]** Last time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:17:33 - 00:17:33]** So epic.

**[00:17:36 - 00:17:38]** We started this whole campaign...

**[00:17:39 - 00:17:44]** With all of you on the run from something or someone.

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:51]** And boarding the Starship Cruiser, the Chimera, headed to Absalom Station.

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:53]** Some of you were trying to escape.

**[00:17:54 - 00:17:57]** Some of you were trying to start looking for something new.

**[00:17:59 - 00:18:03]** So you begin in a docking bay on Legacy Station, apprehending a criminal.

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** A little odd.

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:10]** And this trail of strange events follows you aboard the Chimera.

**[00:18:10 - 00:18:11]** You can't shake it.

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:16]** Asteroid lice, power outages, the disappearance of the security chief, Algiada Iom.

**[00:18:17 - 00:18:27]** Perhaps the disappearance makes sense, though, when there's suspicion of a plot between Algiada and a Vesk passenger, Trostenec.

**[00:18:27 - 00:18:39]** So you get asked by a professor, who's a passenger, and the first mate and interim security chief, Lozu Pahir, to investigate Algiata's disappearance.

**[00:18:40 - 00:18:42]** Along the way, there are more weird events.

**[00:18:42 - 00:18:48]** A panel from the ship, the Star Dream 2, a booby-trapped room of Algiata's.

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:54]** You're confronted with the mercenary group, the New Bloods, who try to take over the ship.

**[00:18:54 - 00:19:08]** So you worked out possible theories of collusions and pirates, but every time you guys tried to pin down an answer to the situation, it feels like the answer just slipped out of your hands the next week, and you're left with more questions.

**[00:19:08 - 00:19:14]** A new motive, a new discovery, a new clue that makes you question, is Lozu good or bad?

**[00:19:15 - 00:19:17]** Is the professor behind this?

**[00:19:18 - 00:19:19]** Was Algiada set up?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:19:19 - 00:19:21]** How will our characters react?

**[00:19:22 - 00:19:25]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:19:25 - 00:19:27]** I wasn't finished, but I liked it.

**[00:19:28 - 00:19:30]** All right, we can just cut that part.

**[00:19:31 - 00:19:35]** Until you discover that Trostenec is not who he says he is.

**[00:19:35 - 00:19:38]** And he's a shape-shifting creature called an Astrozoan.

**[00:19:40 - 00:19:42]** Part of the gang of pirates known as the Starfishers.

**[00:19:42 - 00:19:44]** And they want the ship.

**[00:19:45 - 00:19:48]** And the plan began before you even left Legacy Station.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** And they've killed the captain.

**[00:19:52 - 00:19:57]** And events really begin to escalate as you battle more of the pirate Starfisher crew.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:00]** Who begin a hostile takeover.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:04]** That eventually leads to an Astrazoan Algiata.

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:16]** You finally find that some sort of treasure, that's this relic, is a sheet of metal that says, Relic removed.

**[00:20:16 - 00:20:18]** Reinstall soon.

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:27]** So there you are at the apex of mystery when you try to piece together the final clues and Lozu falls dead.

**[00:20:27 - 00:20:29]** No outward sign of injury from her body.

**[00:20:29 - 00:20:37]** Explosions rock the ship and you race against the clock and your exhausted body to get to the escape pods.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:45]** As you jettison away by the skin of your teeth, you see that the ship is suspended in a vast chamber.

**[00:20:46 - 00:20:52]** Clearly a part of some sort of controlled setting or simulation, something that replicates being in space.

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:56]** The chamber, though, is damaged and falling apart.

**[00:20:57 - 00:21:03]** Meanwhile, you are blasted off into darkness and the ship behind explodes.

**[00:21:04 - 00:21:08]** You have no way to control your destination and more questions than answers.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:11]** So that's where we are now.

**[00:21:12 - 00:21:13]** The afterwards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:16]** What are our characters going to do next?

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:18]** What's even going on?

**[00:21:18 - 00:21:23]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:23 - 00:21:25]** I wanted to feed you a line for that one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:28]** Feed it to me again, we'll redo it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:30]** Why does this room smell like farts?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:33]** Alright, ready for it?

**[00:21:34 - 00:21:36]** Why does this room smell like farts?

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:38]** What will our characters do this time?

**[00:21:38 - 00:21:39]** What is even going on?

**[00:21:40 - 00:21:46]** Find out this time on We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:46 - 00:21:49]** This is what happens when you record in person.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:49 - 00:21:51]** Things change.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:57]** So look, it wasn't long before the light from the explosion of the chimera fades in your pods.

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:02]** Each of you are in separate pods by yourselves, this tiny cramped space.

**[00:22:03 - 00:22:08]** And from there, you're not quite sure how long you're in flight in these escape pods.

**[00:22:09 - 00:22:13]** There's only an inky darkness outside the one porthole window.

**[00:22:14 - 00:22:16]** So it feels like you're moving.

**[00:22:16 - 00:22:21]** Could be several minutes, 10, 20, maybe an hour.

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:25]** Maybe along the way you lulled in a half-awake state.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:33]** You feel the pull of fatigue from the countless battles over the last two days and from escaping a doomed ship.

**[00:22:33 - 00:22:37]** With pretty much only your lives and a couple things in your possessions.

**[00:22:37 - 00:22:47]** Or maybe you are awake, unable to rest, recalling the strange, unsettling death of Lozu Pahir and Professor Benjamin.

**[00:22:47 - 00:22:52]** Recalling the haunting feeling that everything you knew was not as it seemed.

**[00:22:53 - 00:22:56]** So as you're in this pod, what are each of you thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:05]** Um, yeah, here's is obviously like his heart's racing still.

**[00:23:06 - 00:23:19]** Um, he's barely had time to register the fact that we, that we're in this new, like this chamber, which in this side of the structure, his mind goes back to professor Benjamin.

**[00:23:19 - 00:23:26]** And he just wonders what he had to do with all of this wonders what his association was with pirates, with that song that he sang.

**[00:23:26 - 00:23:28]** And yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:28 - 00:23:32]** Was the song that he sang the same song that you guys sang?

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:33]** Or was it separate?

**[00:23:33 - 00:23:35]** It was just a phrase that pirates use.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:23:36 - 00:23:37]** It's a phrase that pirates use.

**[00:23:38 - 00:23:39]** And it is in that song.

**[00:23:39 - 00:23:39]** Yeah.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:40]** Okay.

**[00:23:40 - 00:23:40]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:23:41 - 00:23:43]** Because as a non pirate, I have no idea what's going on with that.

**[00:23:45 - 00:23:46]** but I'll talk.

**[00:23:46 - 00:23:47]** So, so Rick, uh, yeah.

**[00:23:47 - 00:23:48]** What does Rick think?

**[00:23:48 - 00:23:48]** Oh man.

**[00:23:49 - 00:24:11]** Rick is like having flashbacks to what happened to him and how, like he's having all these issues of, of, you know, like what you guys witnessed some of it going on in the, in the, the pre stories and the first episode, but Rick's having these like just visions and images that are flashing through his head that he's like correlating to what he's seen now.

**[00:24:11 - 00:24:13]** And he started to wonder like, what is, what is real?


## Speaker_0

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:14]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:24:14 - 00:24:16]** You know, when did this start?

**[00:24:17 - 00:24:22]** And he's got an urge to find out, you know, an answer, a solution to all this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:24:24 - 00:24:25]** That's...

**[00:24:26 - 00:24:37]** If it helps you guys, it might help to like just close your eyes and just picture like the sense I'm even going to close them to just like being in this cramped space, unfamiliar, nothing.

**[00:24:37 - 00:24:42]** You don't recognize really anything around you except you're like this is commonplace, but also not.

**[00:24:42 - 00:24:45]** There's a symbol on the screen that I can't I can't change the screen.

**[00:24:45 - 00:24:46]** I can't touch it.

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:52]** I can feel the pot, the pod thrusting forward and there's nothing I can do.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:53]** What are you guys thinking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:55 - 00:24:58]** Dr. Roke is just paranoid and scared.

**[00:25:00 - 00:25:09]** And... He... I think... I think in time we'll become violent because of this.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:15]** Because he's just like... He's at his breaking point to a certain degree.

**[00:25:15 - 00:25:20]** And he like... Feels like the wolves are caving in on him.

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:23]** And...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:50]** escape like there's no rap there's no reasoning out of an escape it is going to be a fight or flight yeah situation i like to that you mentioned the walls came in because if you think about it first you're in this docking bay which was not a welcoming docking bay it was like kind of not used like and like when you go to the airport and it's like oh go to go to gate like z 23 and it's like down a couple levels like cattle

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:58]** Yeah, and then you go on the ship, which is a smaller space, and then the ship, you lose the ship, it explodes, and now you're even in a smaller, tiny, isolated space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:00 - 00:26:02]** Yeah, suspicious all the way around.

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:04]** Don't be suspicious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:04 - 00:26:06]** Nico's hyperventilating right now.

**[00:26:06 - 00:26:07]** Oh, really?

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:08]** Wait, what?

**[00:26:08 - 00:26:09]** Nico's hyperventilating right now.

**[00:26:10 - 00:26:12]** He's, as things, as he got on there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:12 - 00:26:14]** Let's see it on your face, Nick.

**[00:26:14 - 00:26:17]** Show us what Nico's doing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:17 - 00:26:18]** So, all right.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:20]** We're picking up right where we left off.

**[00:26:20 - 00:26:22]** The escape pod has launched.

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:25]** Nico is now trying to relax, but he can't get his heart rate down.

**[00:26:25 - 00:26:26]** Things are going faster.

**[00:26:26 - 00:26:28]** Things are going faster and faster.

**[00:26:28 - 00:26:29]** He's trying to catch his breath.

**[00:26:29 - 00:26:30]** He can't quite catch it.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:32]** It keeps going faster.

**[00:26:32 - 00:26:34]** He can't make sense of it.

**[00:26:34 - 00:26:37]** Thoughts are going faster than he can actually grab on and latch on to.

**[00:26:37 - 00:26:44]** And finally, after seeing the bright flash, it's too much sensory overload, and he passes out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:45 - 00:26:45]** Passes out.

**[00:26:46 - 00:26:49]** Slumps in the seat because he's weak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:26:50 - 00:26:50]** Wow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:26:51 - 00:26:52]** That is... I'm sorry.

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:53]** That was intense.

**[00:26:53 - 00:26:54]** That was mean.

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:54]** I take that back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:57]** But that is, like, I 100% picture it.

**[00:26:57 - 00:27:00]** Because as you're flying away... Because you're an android and you don't know.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:02]** Yeah, because you never sleep.

**[00:27:02 - 00:27:02]** Yeah.

**[00:27:03 - 00:27:08]** Unless you press... Unless you get a pin and you press a little tiny button right in your neck and then you just hard reset.

**[00:27:08 - 00:27:10]** Getting shoved into a tube.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** Yeah.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:11]** Getting work done.

**[00:27:11 - 00:27:12]** Who knows?

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:12]** But...

**[00:27:12 - 00:27:18]** Nico, I really can't picture it as like, there's only one porthole that you can really see out of.

**[00:27:18 - 00:27:20]** And that's what you turned and you saw the chimera explode.

**[00:27:20 - 00:27:23]** And then it fades away.

**[00:27:23 - 00:27:25]** And then there's just inky darkness.

**[00:27:25 - 00:27:27]** And you're like, and the thoughts are just in your brain.

**[00:27:28 - 00:27:29]** And you just slump in the seat.

**[00:27:31 - 00:27:38]** I can think that maybe some of you at some point, one of your pods as it was turning had some rotation.

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:49]** So maybe at some point you rotate, you might be able to see the other pods, but you know, you don't really know what's going on in everyone else's pod.

**[00:27:49 - 00:28:00]** All of you do distinctly remember at some point, maybe Nico, you started to slowly wake up a little bit as you all feel the pod flip and

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:05]** And you think, I'm probably facing the opposite direction.

**[00:28:05 - 00:28:07]** And the spread of deceleration.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:07 - 00:28:08]** It's like a retro thruster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** Yeah, well, it flips.

**[00:28:10 - 00:28:11]** It's like in The Expanse.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:13]** It flips so they can slow down on the approach.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:14 - 00:28:15]** Also, great.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:28:16 - 00:28:16]** Great show.

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:17]** Great show.

**[00:28:18 - 00:28:29]** Before you guys come to kind of a soft landing as the pod, you feel some sort of as it couples to something.

**[00:28:31 - 00:28:33]** And you guys turn around.

**[00:28:33 - 00:28:34]** You're trying to look up.

**[00:28:34 - 00:28:35]** Maybe some of you are awake.

**[00:28:35 - 00:28:36]** Some of you move quickly.

**[00:28:36 - 00:28:49]** And you can see that the hatch above you, through the porthole, there's like a soft, diffuse, purple light that is like slowly pulsing.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:53]** Maybe sometimes it flickers off, flickers on.

**[00:28:54 - 00:28:56]** Just helps light up the pod interior a little bit.

**[00:28:58 - 00:29:00]** And with that, if you want to turn your attention


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:01 - 00:29:02]** By the way, just a little bit of flavor.

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:06]** We have some colored lights in here right now, and John actually just did some purple.

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** No, that was Will.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:10]** I just pointed at the purple.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** Will with the flavor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:12 - 00:29:13]** I love it.

**[00:29:13 - 00:29:15]** I mean, I'm controlling the music.

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** Will's got the lights.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:17]** We're all doing this stuff together.

**[00:29:17 - 00:29:18]** We're good.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** Well done.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:19]** Well played.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:20 - 00:29:20]** Put me in the moment.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:29:21 - 00:29:28]** So if you are not on Roll20 on your individual computers, that's fine.

**[00:29:28 - 00:29:32]** But I am going to move us over, and I hope I got everything right as far as the controls.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:32 - 00:29:36]** By the way, I wanted to comment on that opening thing right there, that opening screen.

**[00:29:37 - 00:29:43]** It's got a really nice old-school, early 90s, late 80s Terminator feel to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:44]** Yeah, thanks.

**[00:29:44 - 00:29:45]** I can see that, yeah.

**[00:29:45 - 00:29:45]** Did you make that yourself?

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:46]** Yeah, I did.

**[00:29:46 - 00:29:46]** Nice.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:47]** It took a long time.

**[00:29:47 - 00:29:48]** It's really cool.

**[00:29:48 - 00:29:53]** I don't know if you noticed, it had four escape pods that are shooting across the screen.

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:53]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:29:53 - 00:29:55]** We'll share it.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** Come with me if you want to live.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:29:58 - 00:30:01]** All right, so now we are on a completely black screen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:01 - 00:30:02]** Yeah, describe it.

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:05]** For the night is dark and full of tears.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:05 - 00:30:10]** I'm in a small pill-shaped apparatus, I believe.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:12]** You're a pill-shaped apparatus.

**[00:30:13 - 00:30:15]** How would you describe it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:30:17 - 00:30:18]** Pill-shaped apparatus.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:19 - 00:30:21]** I'm pretty sure they're the escape pods.

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:29]** It's a pill-shaped escape pod with a small cylindrical... You can move them back and forth.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:30]** That's funny.

**[00:30:30 - 00:30:33]** I'm in Dr. O'Keefe's... No, Dr. O'Keefe's in the one next to me.

**[00:30:33 - 00:30:34]** So I can see you guys.

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:36]** I'm lit, but I can barely see you guys.

**[00:30:36 - 00:30:36]** So yeah, there's four.

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:41]** All the players see are four chambers, and each of our characters is in a separate chamber.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:43 - 00:30:46]** So now Nico, Hears, and Rick are all in the same tube.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:49]** They're all in the same one.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:51]** I really should have put up stuff.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:52]** They climbed over.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:53 - 00:30:54]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:30:54 - 00:30:56]** is just over here like, what's going on?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:30:57 - 00:30:58]** Do you mind if I join you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:01]** Hey, guys.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:02 - 00:31:03]** Are we landing?

**[00:31:03 - 00:31:04]** Don't leave me.

**[00:31:04 - 00:31:06]** How can we go through these rules?

**[00:31:06 - 00:31:07]** So I'm getting there.

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:08]** I'm getting there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:08 - 00:31:18]** Well, you know, I didn't even imagine that on the, like, in the very first scene, you guys were just totally jumping over.

**[00:31:18 - 00:31:20]** You painstakingly prepared this whole scenario.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:20 - 00:31:21]** Painstakingly prepared this whole thing.

**[00:31:22 - 00:31:25]** Undone by Roll20.

**[00:31:25 - 00:31:27]** Undone by Roll20's craziness.

**[00:31:27 - 00:31:28]** Let's get it on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:32]** So there's supposed to be a purple light that you guys can see.

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:33]** We'll figure it out later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:31:33 - 00:31:38]** This is adding to my confusion, though, because I pictured four escape pods kind of launching off into nothing.

**[00:31:39 - 00:31:42]** But if we land and there's four pods...

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:50]** exactly next to each other neatly, just adds to the whole simulation idea of it.

**[00:31:50 - 00:31:52]** Maybe we weren't actually escaping.

**[00:31:53 - 00:31:56]** That porthole is just a camera screw.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:31:56 - 00:31:58]** So individually, you are all at a crossroads.

**[00:31:58 - 00:32:04]** Although you were jumping walls here, you can remain in the pods.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:11]** for a long rest, if you would like, or you can remain awake and try and get out.

**[00:32:11 - 00:32:17]** Right now, you don't know that you can talk to each other, but maybe you can check your communications pad.

**[00:32:18 - 00:32:19]** Might work, might not.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:21]** Maybe it got damaged.

**[00:32:21 - 00:32:47]** mechanically uh taking a long rest sounds like a great idea yep i'll take a long rest okay so you guys all take a long rest all right and doctor okay you said you want to check to see if your communication pad works yeah yeah okay do a long rest night's rest is that the same as long rest so yes so nice the first thing rick is going to do then um is take a look around his um chamber so you said there is a communications pad

**[00:32:47 - 00:32:54]** No, so, like, your own communications pad, your own device that you have, which I imagine is, like, it's like a cell phone.

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:55]** You all have one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:32:55 - 00:32:59]** Well, I don't know, because I think I picked one up as a part of my character build.

**[00:32:59 - 00:33:00]** I actually selected a comm unit.

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:02]** I don't know if everybody else has one.

**[00:33:02 - 00:33:03]** I don't know if I have one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:03 - 00:33:08]** I think Kieran might be the only one who hasn't said I suppose you have one, but I kind of assume you would, because... I mean, I don't know if I have their numbers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:09 - 00:33:12]** Yeah, we didn't, like... We didn't exchange numbers.

**[00:33:12 - 00:33:13]** I'll do that when I wake up.

**[00:33:13 - 00:33:14]** We're not that kind of friends.

**[00:33:14 - 00:33:15]** We'll remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:33:15 - 00:33:16]** We'll remember.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:17 - 00:33:18]** We haven't had a moment's rest.

**[00:33:18 - 00:33:19]** I feel like now we can do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:20 - 00:33:26]** If you want to try and use them to talk to each other, you've got to roll for that.

**[00:33:27 - 00:33:29]** You've got to roll to see if it survived your thing.

**[00:33:30 - 00:33:31]** Not a D20, a D100.

**[00:33:31 - 00:33:34]** Ooh!

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:37]** Found a way to break out the D100.

**[00:33:37 - 00:33:40]** I'm just all about using the obscure die.

**[00:33:40 - 00:33:41]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:43]** I don't think anybody's really rolled a D12.

**[00:33:43 - 00:33:45]** That's a 63 for Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:45 - 00:33:45]** 63 to 26.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:46]** Ooh, 26.

**[00:33:46 - 00:33:47]** Getting low here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:49]** I mean, but low is better, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:33:49 - 00:33:50]** 38.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:51]** 38.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:54]** We're all scrounging for dice here.

**[00:33:54 - 00:33:55]** 80.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:55]** 80.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:56]** 80.

**[00:33:58 - 00:33:59]** All of it seems to work.

**[00:34:00 - 00:34:03]** Here's and Rick, maybe you've got to kind of hit it a little bit.

**[00:34:03 - 00:34:05]** Maybe just like got something.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:06]** Come on.

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:07]** But then it works.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:08]** You were close.

**[00:34:08 - 00:34:10]** You had to get 20 or above.

**[00:34:10 - 00:34:12]** In Delta Green, it's success below, right?

**[00:34:12 - 00:34:13]** Yes.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:13]** Yeah.

**[00:34:13 - 00:34:17]** So in everything else, I'm just assuming it's success above.

**[00:34:18 - 00:34:18]** Okay.

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:22]** But you all can communicate with each other kind of with text.

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** Here's.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:23]** Nico.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:24 - 00:34:25]** Dr. Okay.

**[00:34:26 - 00:34:26]** Can you hear me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:27 - 00:34:29]** Yes, what's going on here?

**[00:34:30 - 00:34:31]** Hey, Rick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:32]** Yeah, I got you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:33 - 00:34:34]** You all right?

**[00:34:34 - 00:34:35]** I am alive.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:37]** That is A+.

**[00:34:38 - 00:34:39]** Nico, Nico, are you there?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:34:39 - 00:34:39]** Nico?

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:42]** Nico's going to type back, hi.

**[00:34:46 - 00:34:47]** Nico, you all right?

**[00:34:48 - 00:34:49]** What's going on?

**[00:34:49 - 00:34:51]** Do you need something to relax?

**[00:34:51 - 00:34:53]** Nico, are you okay?

**[00:34:55 - 00:34:56]** I seem fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:57 - 00:34:58]** All right.

**[00:34:58 - 00:34:59]** I'm not fine.

**[00:35:00 - 00:35:02]** So I doubt you are either.

**[00:35:02 - 00:35:06]** But we've got to get out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:07 - 00:35:11]** Rick is going to do, I guess, a perception to see if there's a way to open the capsule.

**[00:35:12 - 00:35:14]** So there's no more motion.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:14 - 00:35:17]** We are steady and stable.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:17 - 00:35:19]** And we're landed on the side of a wall?

**[00:35:19 - 00:35:20]** We don't know that.

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:20]** You don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:35:20 - 00:35:24]** You can't really see too much about what's going on there.

**[00:35:24 - 00:35:26]** Nico's going to type out on his data page here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:27]** He's going to type out.

**[00:35:27 - 00:35:32]** He's going to be... Do we have any type of environmental sensors of where we're at?

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:33]** Sorry.

**[00:35:33 - 00:35:35]** If you want to... Like in the pod?

**[00:35:36 - 00:35:37]** No, outside the pod.

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:41]** Do we have any means of knowing whether or not the atmosphere is breathable?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:43 - 00:35:48]** I will take a first step since I have a little more... So we all have suits, right?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:48 - 00:35:49]** Like second...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:53]** I'm pretty sure you all have environmental protections on all of your suits.

**[00:35:53 - 00:35:56]** But does environmental protection give us pressurized spacesuits?

**[00:35:56 - 00:35:57]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:59]** You could go in space.

**[00:35:59 - 00:36:03]** But I'll roll perception on my pod to see if there's just an opening.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:11]** Ten plus... I rolled a... Plus six, so I got a 16 for that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:36:11 - 00:36:12]** 16 perception.

**[00:36:12 - 00:36:13]** 29.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:16]** Wow, that's impressive.

**[00:36:16 - 00:36:18]** Hold on, I'm rolling perception for Nico here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:18 - 00:36:23]** And that was to see if you can see if there's anything that you can see from outside?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:36:24 - 00:36:26]** No, if there's anything, like is there just a handle I can open?

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:28]** Is there a button I can push?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:36:29 - 00:36:36]** Nico's rolling perception to see if he can notice anything outside that would hint that they're on a stable, breathable atmosphere.

**[00:36:37 - 00:36:43]** And if not, he's going to do a computer's check to see if he can access any type of systems to discover atmosphere.

**[00:36:43 - 00:36:44]** Okay.

**[00:36:44 - 00:36:46]** So 21 on the perception.

**[00:36:46 - 00:36:47]** Let me know if I need to roll computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:47 - 00:36:50]** You would need to roll out computers, but I can, yeah, go ahead.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:36:50 - 00:36:52]** I can roll out computers also and assist.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:36:52 - 00:36:57]** So just so you know, you would just be essentially, are you using computers with a computer pad or computers within the pod?

**[00:36:58 - 00:36:59]** Computers within the pod.

**[00:36:59 - 00:37:00]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:00 - 00:37:02]** Do you ask for help on the data pad?

**[00:37:02 - 00:37:03]** We can assist you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:04 - 00:37:05]** Are you going to allow that, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:05 - 00:37:08]** Because we're all kind of on our own.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:08 - 00:37:09]** 28 on the computers for the pod.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:10]** I got 11, 20.

**[00:37:10 - 00:37:12]** No, I got a 24.

**[00:37:12 - 00:37:12]** Sorry.

**[00:37:13 - 00:37:13]** 13 plus 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:37:14 - 00:37:16]** I still don't have computers, but I do have engineering now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:37:16 - 00:37:18]** I got a 24 on my computer.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:37:18 - 00:37:20]** Plus 11 computers, but I have a 14 for this role.

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:21]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:23]** You cannot see.

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:26]** You can't tell whether there's any sort of atmosphere.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:26]** Not sure.

**[00:37:27 - 00:37:29]** You don't think why not, but also you're not sure.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:41]** Dr. O'Keefe, you are looking through and with such a high role, I kind of imagine that... Because when you touch a screen and try and manipulate it, it doesn't respond to you.

**[00:37:41 - 00:37:45]** You couldn't control the pod without going through.

**[00:37:45 - 00:37:50]** So I'm thinking that if you wanted to do an engineering to try and do that, that's fine.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:52]** But I can say that...

**[00:37:52 - 00:38:02]** As you're maybe starting to go through and saying, actually, I might be able to kind of get into the computers here and like take them off and like maybe try and hook it up to my data pad or something.

**[00:38:02 - 00:38:03]** Maybe try and see what's going on.

**[00:38:03 - 00:38:08]** As that happens, because here's and Rick, you were looking for a way out.

**[00:38:08 - 00:38:13]** And as you two individually, you like start to move your hand up towards the hatch.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:16]** You hear like a soft...

**[00:38:16 - 00:38:27]** from outside the door, you see through your porthole, you see like the hatch start to slide open and this like manhole door kind of swings open and you feel- From our individual pods or like outside?

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:29]** Yeah, the two of you from your individual pods.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:32]** And it feels a little bit like your pods like tilting up.

**[00:38:32 - 00:38:36]** And your seat kind of like slides down and back and you like brace yourself.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:49]** It's a little awkward, but you turn around and you can like sit on the edge of this like manhole door and you're sitting on the edge or like just a few feet off the ground and you can look into the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:38:50 - 00:38:53]** Rick is going to draw his rifle, his artillery laser.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:54]** Okay.

**[00:38:54 - 00:38:55]** Which is more than a rifle.

**[00:38:55 - 00:38:58]** It's like a shoulder-blasted laser cannon.

**[00:38:59 - 00:38:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:38:59 - 00:39:01]** Dr. Okay and Nick.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:10]** I'm going to feel around and try to open, I suppose, my... Yeah, you're also able to do the same.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:10 - 00:39:14]** As you start to move your hands up, it kind of senses that and automatically does it.

**[00:39:14 - 00:39:15]** So the hatch opens, right?

**[00:39:15 - 00:39:16]** It opens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:16 - 00:39:19]** So now can Rick breathe in and feel air?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:20 - 00:39:22]** It seems like a stable atmosphere.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:39:22 - 00:39:27]** So then he'll relay, like, everybody, I got my hatch open and I believe the air is fine.

**[00:39:29 - 00:39:30]** At least for an android's sake.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:39:31 - 00:39:34]** Nico isn't going to respond, but he's going to open his hatch.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:39:34 - 00:39:41]** Okay, so you all open your hatch, and if you guys want to move your characters up towards the front, I will reveal.

**[00:39:41 - 00:39:42]** You want me to move it over to the other chamber?

**[00:39:42 - 00:39:43]** No, to the other side.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:45]** This one?

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:45]** Yeah.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** This one?

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:46]** Yeah.

**[00:39:46 - 00:39:48]** I'll read what you guys see, and then I'll show you.

**[00:39:48 - 00:40:01]** The walls, double door, and 15-foot ceiling of the sterile-looking room just outside are made up of spotless plates of dull metal.

**[00:40:01 - 00:40:06]** In the deep distance, you can occasionally hear maybe a low rumbling sound.

**[00:40:06 - 00:40:12]** And then maybe the room, you feel these vibrations as it shakes slightly as the ground jolts.

**[00:40:13 - 00:40:18]** The whole room feels like it could be unstable soon, but then it's quickly stable.

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:21]** So it feels like you're not quite sure what's going on.

**[00:40:22 - 00:40:26]** Perhaps in several hours, it'll become even more unstable, perhaps a few days later.

**[00:40:27 - 00:40:40]** Narrow windows to your left and your right sit about three feet from the floor and provide a view of a cavernous hollow carved into dark rock.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:48]** With each pulse, you see a few rocks and the dim light come loose with the same shaking.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:57]** The room is illuminated by oscillating purple lights mounted on tubes leading to the hatches that you all are sitting on in the eastern wall.

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:14]** To the west is a double bulkhead door similarly outlined in flashing almost sporadic purple lights and a series of symbols flash on a screen in the center of the double door.

**[00:41:15 - 00:41:17]** This is what you guys see.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:18 - 00:41:26]** Rick, with his gun raised, is going to step out and basically clear the room, scan around in case anything is going to attack us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:29]** Rick, Nico's going to do the same.

**[00:41:29 - 00:41:31]** He's going to hop out.

**[00:41:31 - 00:41:33]** Just eerily calm.

**[00:41:33 - 00:41:34]** Not in a good way.

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:37]** He's not truly calm, but he's eerily calm.

**[00:41:38 - 00:41:44]** He's going to have his dueling sword in his left hand and his azimuth laser pistol in his right, and he's coming out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:41:45 - 00:41:48]** I picture him holding the blade across to him.

**[00:41:48 - 00:41:53]** Like, almost like it's ready to slash, and then, like, resting his pistol over his hand.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:41:53 - 00:41:54]** It's more along the lines of this.

**[00:41:54 - 00:42:03]** It's kind of like Pirates of the Caribbean, where he's got his blaster over the head, blaster outstretched, and his sword just kind of ready close to parry.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** Okay.

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:04]** So.

**[00:42:05 - 00:42:06]** That's a cool picture, too.

**[00:42:06 - 00:42:07]** I like that.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:07]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:42:08 - 00:42:11]** Gears just has his hand on his sword, steps out of the pod.

**[00:42:12 - 00:42:12]** Hmm.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:13]** Dr. O.K.

**[00:42:13 - 00:42:24]** is clutching his tactical syringe spear, looking very wide-eyed at all of this, wondering what's coming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:24 - 00:42:26]** A lot of apprehension.

**[00:42:26 - 00:42:28]** Let me reveal, actually, what you guys can see.

**[00:42:28 - 00:42:29]** Yeah, you said there's symbols?

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:31]** Can any of us read these symbols?

**[00:42:32 - 00:42:34]** So let me first reveal a little bit.

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:36]** The rock you can see, you can see out here.

**[00:42:36 - 00:42:38]** I'm revealing on the Roll20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:42]** And before I forget, somebody, whoever has the relic, I want to see that thing.

**[00:42:43 - 00:42:44]** Because I can read it now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:44 - 00:42:45]** I can too, by the way.

**[00:42:46 - 00:42:46]** Do you have Aklo?

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:47]** You also took Aklo?

**[00:42:47 - 00:42:49]** Yeah, because I'm a scholar.

**[00:42:49 - 00:42:50]** I can just do those things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:42:51 - 00:42:52]** I can just learn it.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:52]** Okay.

**[00:42:52 - 00:42:53]** Or open it.

**[00:42:53 - 00:42:54]** I don't know.

**[00:42:55 - 00:43:16]** well i have culture now so i could maybe do so who wants to do what you all seem to be walking out apprehensively into this cold room 25 by 30 so i'm gonna click here you can see the double doors but okay so again like the symbols i just rolled a 16 for a culture check to identify the language okay uh here's a little cyst with that is that what you guys want to do


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:16 - 00:43:22]** Oh, I was just going to point out that, yeah, we were looking at these these four skate pods that just launched on the side of a ship randomly.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:23]** Right.

**[00:43:23 - 00:43:24]** You'd think they would just blast off.

**[00:43:24 - 00:43:26]** They could land anywhere, blah, blah, blah.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:27]** No, no.

**[00:43:27 - 00:43:31]** They lined up perfectly side by side by side as if it was coming back on a Disney ride.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:43:32 - 00:43:32]** Yeah.

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:33]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:33 - 00:43:34]** Hey, your ride's over.

**[00:43:34 - 00:43:34]** Step off.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:35 - 00:43:39]** As you pulled in, you saw a screen and it was like pictures of all your faces.

**[00:43:39 - 00:43:41]** Yeah, Nico was passed out.

**[00:43:41 - 00:43:43]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:46 - 00:43:48]** I want to see that picture now.

**[00:43:48 - 00:43:49]** I want to see that picture.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:43:49 - 00:43:51]** The symbols are just prices for the photos.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:43:51 - 00:43:54]** We should totally get that picture and post it up on Instagram or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:43:54 - 00:43:55]** I scanned the rack.

**[00:43:55 - 00:43:57]** Are there other pictures of other people?

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:00]** Space Mountain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:44:00 - 00:44:02]** Space Mountain.

**[00:44:02 - 00:44:03]** Space Mountain.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:03 - 00:44:25]** the idea that is this paizo's collaboration i want this picture up on our instagram yesterday sorry what what were you saying here just to comment that if that escape pod moment where we were out floating around was also part of the simulation that's crazy um also here's roll to 19 for culture so he's helping look at these writings


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:44:25 - 00:44:30]** Okay, so here's – and, Nico, what are you doing?

**[00:44:30 - 00:44:32]** Are you just staying right where you are?

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:33]** Kind of look at the wall.

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:35]** Yeah, we're looking around.

**[00:44:35 - 00:44:38]** So it's dead ahead of you where you see that center purple light.

**[00:44:38 - 00:44:38]** I'm sorry.

**[00:44:39 - 00:44:41]** I have a thing on my screen that the whole room is bathed in purple.

**[00:44:41 - 00:44:43]** I'll figure that out for next time.

**[00:44:43 - 00:44:48]** But where that is is where the double doors are, and there's a screen.

**[00:44:48 - 00:44:55]** And there's actually – you can see, too, there's a small control pad off to the right where you can presumably kind of control the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:44:55 - 00:44:58]** Are there any portholes, windows, etc.

**[00:44:59 - 00:44:59]** on these doors?

**[00:44:59 - 00:45:00]** No.

**[00:45:00 - 00:45:02]** Here's looks at the writing.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:02]** What does he see?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:04 - 00:45:07]** You walk up to the door and you're peering at the door and looking at the writing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:09]** I would like to look at these writings.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:10 - 00:45:12]** What do we get with the culture checkup?

**[00:45:12 - 00:45:13]** What language is it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:16]** Do you want me to roll culture?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:16 - 00:45:17]** Nico already did.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:20]** Nico and here's already rolled culture.

**[00:45:20 - 00:45:21]** You missed your opportunity.

**[00:45:22 - 00:45:23]** You only get one chance.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:24]** Do not miss your shot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:24 - 00:45:25]** Do not get your chance to blow.

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:27]** It's opportunity, folks.

**[00:45:27 - 00:45:28]** Why the folks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:29 - 00:45:30]** Why the folks?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:31 - 00:45:33]** Why folks?

**[00:45:34 - 00:45:35]** No, I'm not getting mad.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** I'm just curious.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** Why folks?

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:38]** Why folks?

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:38]** White folks?

**[00:45:38 - 00:45:40]** Is that what you said?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:45:40 - 00:45:44]** No, he says it's opportunity folks once in a lifetime.

**[00:45:44 - 00:45:46]** I don't think Eminem says folks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** I don't think he says that.

**[00:45:47 - 00:45:48]** No, I know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:52]** It's opportunity knocks once in a lifetime.

**[00:45:52 - 00:45:53]** That's what it is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:55]** But I thought we all knew that and you were just joking.

**[00:45:55 - 00:46:07]** Nick was serious Let everyone know everyone else I'm blanking on the name of the song It's called Lose Yourself It's from 8 Mile


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:46:07 - 00:46:09]** Okay, so here's the thing.

**[00:46:09 - 00:46:26]** You can't quite tell what language it is, but from the way the symbols are flashing, it seems to be like they're kind of too short or long or intermittent to be coherent in a way.

**[00:46:27 - 00:46:33]** And you recognize that these symbols, you can't quite make out what they are, but...

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:42]** As you're looking at it, you notice that as you're looking at these symbols, you're like, except for Dr. OK, because you don't really have five fingers on your hand.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:53]** But you notice that the symbols can be like made with one hand, with a five fingered hand, with an opposable thumb.

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** Like, they're, like, sketches of a hand, kind of.

**[00:46:56 - 00:47:05]** So... Yeah, like, if you can imagine, it's, like... Like, it looks more... So we can, like, put up gang signs to these symbols and... Yeah.

**[00:47:05 - 00:47:07]** Or is it shadow puppets?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:07 - 00:47:07]** No, not gang.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:08]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:09]** Rick's shadow puppets?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:09 - 00:47:10]** Like a chicken or a dinosaur.

**[00:47:10 - 00:47:11]** Oh, yeah.

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:12]** Rick's shadow puppets?

**[00:47:12 - 00:47:13]** That's what it is.

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:14]** It was Rick the entire time.

**[00:47:14 - 00:47:16]** It's Rick the entire time.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:16]** Wow.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:16]** Wow.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:18]** Wow, this is crazy.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:19]** Rick Shadowmaster.

**[00:47:19 - 00:47:20]** And that's the AP, everybody.

**[00:47:20 - 00:47:23]** He was the Shadowmaster.

**[00:47:23 - 00:47:25]** He was the Murderbot after all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:31]** His true name was Murderbot.

**[00:47:31 - 00:47:32]** About the Shadowmaster.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:47:33 - 00:47:38]** There's multiple symbols of these hand drawings just flickering on the door.

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:40]** They're flickering.

**[00:47:40 - 00:47:43]** Like, one's on the screen, poof, changes, poof, changes, stays there.

**[00:47:44 - 00:47:48]** Like, it's so intermittent that you're like, this seems not regular.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:50]** This doesn't seem like it's intentional.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:47:50 - 00:47:51]** Oh, okay, got it.

**[00:47:51 - 00:47:52]** There's no pattern.

**[00:47:54 - 00:47:55]** It's not like Simon Says.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:47:56 - 00:47:58]** What do you guys want to do?

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:01]** This is all in, like, perception.

**[00:48:02 - 00:48:06]** So as an android, I want to like study these things.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** Okay.

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:08]** So I'm going to roll perception.

**[00:48:08 - 00:48:09]** Okay.

**[00:48:09 - 00:48:15]** And I'm going to basically try to record the images in my mind and then try to make sense of it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:15 - 00:48:18]** I suggest we try and play back with these hand gestures maybe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:18 - 00:48:21]** Ten plus six.

**[00:48:21 - 00:48:22]** Sixteen.

**[00:48:22 - 00:48:24]** Sixteen.

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:29]** Yeah, I mean, you're able to go through, memorize them, kind of catalog them, but that's about it.

**[00:48:30 - 00:48:31]** You don't notice anything else.

**[00:48:31 - 00:48:38]** Can I look around for some sort of mechanism or interface that would allow us to... Give a perception check.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:48:40 - 00:48:47]** In the meantime, Rick is going to find something to scrape this onto the ground or something so he can show the others and put it out in order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:51]** I did a culture check, by the way, to see if I could recognize what the hand signals meant.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:48:51 - 00:48:53]** no, that was part of your original culture check.

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:55]** So yeah.

**[00:48:55 - 00:48:56]** Yeah.

**[00:48:56 - 00:48:58]** You could tell that they were all made by one hand.

**[00:48:58 - 00:48:59]** That was part of it.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:00]** Okay.

**[00:49:00 - 00:49:01]** So it's just a puzzle.

**[00:49:02 - 00:49:04]** So Rick's going to then do with escape room or something.

**[00:49:05 - 00:49:10]** Well, so, so you said you wanted to, so there's nothing on the ground that you can use.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:10 - 00:49:13]** I mean like on me, I don't have something I can just scrape.

**[00:49:14 - 00:49:14]** Sure.

**[00:49:15 - 00:49:17]** You can like take your gun and try and I'm, I'm,

**[00:49:17 - 00:49:19]** I was thinking like pizza chalk or something.

**[00:49:19 - 00:49:20]** Can you try that?

**[00:49:20 - 00:49:22]** Do we have like duct tape?

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:23]** I'm sure I got duct tape.

**[00:49:23 - 00:49:24]** What are you trying to scrape off?

**[00:49:24 - 00:49:26]** I'm trying to replicate like the images over and over again.

**[00:49:27 - 00:49:29]** I'm putting them in order so we can like study them.

**[00:49:29 - 00:49:33]** So like Rick is going to draw them onto the floor in some way, one way or another.

**[00:49:33 - 00:49:36]** Does anybody have a means of uploading these pictures?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:49:37 - 00:49:39]** What did I get from my perception?


## Speaker_0

**[00:49:39 - 00:49:40]** Well,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:49:40 - 00:49:40]** I'm getting there, Will.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:42]** I'm just... I got a seven on engineering.

**[00:49:42 - 00:49:46]** Yeah, so... So I don't find anything to do that way.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:48]** Well, do you just want to use your gun or no?

**[00:49:49 - 00:49:52]** Sure, I'll just scrape it with... Well, probably my battle axe.

**[00:49:52 - 00:49:55]** I'll take the base of my battle axe and try to scrape this into the ground.

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:55]** The hilt.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:49:55 - 00:49:59]** Okay, this is how it's going to happen.

**[00:49:59 - 00:50:01]** Rick, you take out the base of your gun.

**[00:50:02 - 00:50:03]** You start to move it.

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** Battle Axe.

**[00:50:04 - 00:50:06]** Battle Axe over to the door.

**[00:50:06 - 00:50:07]** At that time, Dr.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:09]** O.K., you've just been sitting here this whole time.

**[00:50:09 - 00:50:14]** Maybe you've been hearing them talking about the hand and you're trying to put it together.

**[00:50:14 - 00:50:18]** You're zoning out because you're looking at it and you're like, there's...

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:47]** there's like how does it connect because it's in the door how does it connect to the control panel which is like you know five feet off to the right it's like on the wall and then you look and and and you're like wait uh there's like there's like a little hole in the panel and maybe you like walk up and you look and you realize push a paper the hole i just pull out my my wallet that has my lock picking stuff exactly no it's uh you notice in that the hole is actually a camera

**[00:50:48 - 00:51:05]** gone and at that time you're looking and you're like huh and then you follow it over and you look around the door and there's flashing like purple lights around the door and you're like this like not only are the symbols flashing but the door's flashing and then you'd notice

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:24]** extra wiring it almost seems like in the control panel like it just seems bulky and you're like a door that needs to open this doesn't need that much space in the wall you're putting two and two together and you're like i think this i think there might be something like a trap on the door

**[00:51:25 - 00:51:26]** Oh, dang.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:32]** And Rick is about to go over and take the battle action.

**[00:51:32 - 00:51:33]** Watch out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:33 - 00:51:34]** There's a trap.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:51:34 - 00:51:44]** And at that same time, from above you in the ceiling, you all hear this sound.

**[00:51:44 - 00:51:46]** It sounds like it's muffled, like it's above the ceiling.

**[00:51:47 - 00:51:48]** You're like, what is that?

**[00:51:48 - 00:51:51]** It sounds like... Just a bunch of astrozoans.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** And... I get the feeling you're right.

**[00:51:54 - 00:52:01]** And when that happens, you also hear like... Because Dr.

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:06]** O.K., you realize that as you came in, you're like, the ceiling doesn't look right.

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** And a hatch...

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:35]** opens and when that hatch opens you see these like two long metallic scaly tentacles just like dangling about three feet and they lower in and they're attached to this large saucer like body and the first robot is followed by a second robot both of them quickly come out and you hear like and

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:38]** and they come in, and you all need to roll for initiative.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:40]** Damn it.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** Ooh.

**[00:52:42 - 00:52:43]** What you looking for, John?

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:43]** Nothing.

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:46]** I was just putting the pawns.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:46]** Oh.

**[00:52:47 - 00:52:47]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:48 - 00:52:48]** I like them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:50]** Are those pawns from Wazo?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:52:51 - 00:52:51]** Beautiful.

**[00:52:52 - 00:52:56]** John just put two pawns on the screen where we have our Roll20 map out.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:56]** Yeah.

**[00:52:56 - 00:52:57]** It's beautiful.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:58 - 00:52:59]** It's beautiful.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:59 - 00:53:00]** It's so great.

**[00:53:00 - 00:53:02]** It's so great.

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:03]** Oh, look at it.

**[00:53:03 - 00:53:06]** Yeah, it's pretty freaking intense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:06 - 00:53:08]** That looks like something the Navy might film.

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:10]** It's pretty freaking awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:10 - 00:53:17]** So it looks like a flying saucer with a blue light and two metal tentacles coming out of the bottom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:20]** Does it also travel into the wind at 120 knots?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:23]** Yeah, does it make erroneous movements?

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:24]** What?

**[00:53:24 - 00:53:25]** And the U.S.

**[00:53:25 - 00:53:28]** Navy is going to release images of this three months ago?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:29]** Yes.

**[00:53:29 - 00:53:29]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:32]** That is exactly what happened.

**[00:53:32 - 00:53:33]** So ugly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:53:33 - 00:53:34]** Oh, it's so good.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** All right.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:37]** This is our first combat.

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:37]** Huh?

**[00:53:37 - 00:53:39]** 20 for initiative.

**[00:53:39 - 00:53:42]** Okay, so we got Rick over here with a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:53:42 - 00:53:45]** Yeah, because he puts all his bonus points into initiative.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:49]** Do you have a plus 11 initiative or something?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:53:49 - 00:53:54]** No, so I had Advanced Initiative as a feat, and I changed that.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:55]** Oh, okay.

**[00:53:55 - 00:53:57]** Because it's worthless, because I always try to delay or something.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:59]** I was almost going to get that one.

**[00:53:59 - 00:54:02]** Don't get me triggered on delay actions.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:02]** That's true.

**[00:54:02 - 00:54:03]** Save it for another time.

**[00:54:03 - 00:54:04]** All right, so Rick got a 20.

**[00:54:04 - 00:54:05]** What did everyone else get?

**[00:54:05 - 00:54:06]** Let's go around the room.

**[00:54:06 - 00:54:08]** Got a 9 from here.

**[00:54:08 - 00:54:10]** It's not a strong start.

**[00:54:10 - 00:54:12]** Maybe you're looking at the door too long.

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** It does.

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:13]** Dr.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:15]** O.K., what did you get?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:15]** 14.

**[00:54:15 - 00:54:16]** Wow, okay, all right.

**[00:54:16 - 00:54:17]** Good.

**[00:54:18 - 00:54:19]** It's a good middling roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:19 - 00:54:20]** What about you?

**[00:54:20 - 00:54:21]** My dice must have got COVID.

**[00:54:21 - 00:54:24]** I got a natural two plus three for a total of five.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:26]** Wow.

**[00:54:26 - 00:54:27]** Wow.

**[00:54:27 - 00:54:28]** All right.

**[00:54:28 - 00:54:28]** Five.

**[00:54:29 - 00:54:32]** That's funny because on my tracker, I already had you at five.

**[00:54:32 - 00:54:32]** Yeah.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:34]** No, like before you even told me.

**[00:54:34 - 00:54:35]** It just put in five.

**[00:54:35 - 00:54:36]** It was pretty awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:36 - 00:54:42]** Well, that's because I think it put me when I rolled the initiative on Hero Lab.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:45]** It has this cool thing, GM and me only.

**[00:54:45 - 00:54:46]** And I rolled it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:54:46 - 00:54:47]** Oh, I don't have it open.

**[00:54:47 - 00:54:50]** So I should probably have it open so I can see what you sent me.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:51]** I'm sorry.

**[00:54:52 - 00:54:53]** You know what, John?

**[00:54:53 - 00:54:54]** I try so hard for you sometimes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:54]** I know.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:55]** You really do.

**[00:54:55 - 00:54:56]** And you know what?

**[00:54:56 - 00:54:57]** In the end, it doesn't even matter.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:54:57 - 00:54:59]** It's never appreciated.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:00 - 00:55:00]** Good stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** Oh, that's what it looks like.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:55:02 - 00:55:03]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:03]** Dang, you guys.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:05]** You're in a strange room.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:06]** You're looking at the door.

**[00:55:06 - 00:55:13]** You realize the door is showing these strange symbols that are some sort of weird symbols that you can make with your hand.

**[00:55:14 - 00:55:16]** And it seems like the room is unstable.

**[00:55:16 - 00:55:19]** Occasionally there's vibrations and it's shaking.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:22]** The whole foundation of the place is something's going on.

**[00:55:23 - 00:55:26]** And as you are looking at the door...

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:28]** Dr. K says, wait, don't do that.

**[00:55:29 - 00:55:30]** Seems like it might be trapped.

**[00:55:30 - 00:55:34]** And two robots come out of the ceiling.

**[00:55:35 - 00:55:40]** And at that moment, there's a shaking that shakes it just enough.

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:46]** And the room actually drops into dim light as some of the lights go off.

**[00:55:46 - 00:55:51]** And so you are now all technically in dim light conditions.

**[00:55:52 - 00:55:58]** And we're starting round one with these robots that are probably floating at head height now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:55:58 - 00:56:00]** Wait, can we just review?

**[00:56:00 - 00:56:01]** Like who has what?

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:04]** So Rick has dark vision and low light vision.

**[00:56:05 - 00:56:05]** Okay.

**[00:56:06 - 00:56:08]** I see dim light as if it were normal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:09 - 00:56:09]** Okay.

**[00:56:10 - 00:56:12]** Here's has blind sense.

**[00:56:12 - 00:56:14]** So you can sense things and creatures with a sense other than sight.

**[00:56:14 - 00:56:15]** So that probably helps.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:15 - 00:56:16]** Not blind sight.

**[00:56:16 - 00:56:18]** There's a difference between blind sense and blind sight.

**[00:56:18 - 00:56:19]** Blind sense, yeah.

**[00:56:19 - 00:56:21]** So blind sense, you know something's there.

**[00:56:22 - 00:56:24]** But blind sight, you can see the object.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:24 - 00:56:27]** But can I determine the location outside of sight with blind sense?

**[00:56:27 - 00:56:28]** I don't believe so.

**[00:56:28 - 00:56:29]** Check it out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:56:29 - 00:56:31]** I think it just gives you a better chance to.

**[00:56:31 - 00:56:33]** So you just have to roll something for it.

**[00:56:33 - 00:56:35]** Just click on Blind Sense and see what it tells you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:36 - 00:56:43]** So with dim light, there's a 20% miss chance from creatures without dark vision or the ability to see in darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:44]** I have dark vision.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:56:44 - 00:56:54]** Yeah, so I'm pretty sure that it would pretty much only be, without talking about the robots that came down, Nico, I think you and he are actually the only people who can't see in darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[00:56:54 - 00:56:55]** Yeah.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:55]** What?

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:58]** I'm an insect.

**[00:56:58 - 00:56:58]** Nonsense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:56:58 - 00:57:01]** So blind sense does help out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:57:01 - 00:57:10]** If things were to go completely dark, I think you would be more on the level of dark vision because the way that Starfinder has it, there's like four levels of awareness.

**[00:57:10 - 00:57:15]** There's like totally aware, aware of location, aware of presence, and totally unaware.

**[00:57:15 - 00:57:16]** Dark sense gives you presence.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:21]** Or blind sense gives you like another level up so you don't have to do as many things as Nico would have to do.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:23]** But we've been talking for long enough.

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:24]** We need to get going here.

**[00:57:24 - 00:57:25]** Let's see Dr.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:28]** O.K., third level biohacker, taking on some monsters.

**[00:57:28 - 00:57:32]** What is his first move of book two going to be?

**[00:57:32 - 00:57:35]** Book two, first move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:35 - 00:57:36]** Book two, first move.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:36 - 00:57:40]** So this obviously isn't a biological creature, so I can't really use a life science check.

**[00:57:40 - 00:57:40]** You don't know that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** What if they're just wearing armor?

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:48]** It could be astrozoan with tentacles inside of a spaceship.

**[00:57:48 - 00:57:49]** Maybe we should do a life science check on it.

**[00:57:49 - 00:57:50]** I'm just saying.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:53]** Do you want to do a life science check on it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:53 - 00:58:04]** I mean, I was going to use my ability of a pious scientist to use life science to identify a creature normally identified by something else.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:05]** Oh, dang.

**[00:58:05 - 00:58:06]** Yeah.

**[00:58:06 - 00:58:19]** uh it's it's from like mysticism or vice versa like it i don't know if it applies so um can i just roll perception and see like wait i want to learn what's it called

**[00:58:20 - 00:58:29]** It's an ability... It is... It's in the Alien Archive 2.

**[00:58:29 - 00:58:35]** Oh, I don't have that book.

**[00:58:35 - 00:58:38]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:38 - 00:58:39]** Okay, got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:40]** I don't know if it's mysticism.

**[00:58:40 - 00:58:42]** So what would I use to identify this creature?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:58:43 - 00:58:45]** I think you would still use life science to identify a creature.

**[00:58:46 - 00:58:53]** The point is that now, whichever one was higher, because before you can only use mysticism to get mysticism creatures, life science to get life science creatures, right?

**[00:58:53 - 00:58:55]** But now you can use either whichever one's higher.

**[00:58:55 - 00:58:59]** That's my quick one minute hot take read on it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:59 - 00:59:02]** I'm going to use life science to identify this creature.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Okie dokie.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** Okay.

**[00:59:07 - 00:59:09]** That is an 18 plus 15.

**[00:59:10 - 00:59:12]** And I'm really bad at math.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:12 - 00:59:13]** 18 plus 15, that's 33.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:15]** 33 on my life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:17]** How many ranks do you have in life science?

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:18]** That's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:19]** It's because I took the feat.

**[00:59:19 - 00:59:21]** That's crazy.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:21]** I told you.

**[00:59:21 - 00:59:22]** That's crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:22 - 00:59:25]** I'm trying to OP my skills.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:25 - 00:59:29]** But I think you can only have as many ranks as you have levels in any skill.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:29 - 00:59:38]** Right, but I took a feat that also allowed skill synergy, which gives me a plus two insight bonus to class feats, which these two are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:38]** Dang.

**[00:59:38 - 00:59:41]** So it's plus two, then plus whatever.

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:42]** It's plus two.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:42 - 00:59:43]** Okay.

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:44]** So my ability bonus is plus four.

**[00:59:44 - 00:59:45]** This is just for me.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:47]** My insight bonus is plus two with the scientific method.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** Yep.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:52]** But my additional skill synergy feat plus two.

**[00:59:52 - 00:59:54]** So that gives it another one.

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:57]** Plus it's a class skill, which is plus three.

**[00:59:57 - 01:00:02]** And I have theme knowledge because I'm going to the Sharu and that's plus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** So that's plus 15.

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:05]** Yes.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:05 - 01:00:06]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]** That is insane.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:08]** I think it all checks out.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:09]** Really?

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:10]** I think so.

**[01:00:10 - 01:00:11]** Rules lawyer says it checks out.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:13]** Rules lawyer helped me set it up.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** That is crazy.

**[01:00:14 - 01:00:15]** That is awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:18]** Do we have Robert's Rules Rewarder in addition to the actual rules book here?

**[01:00:18 - 01:00:20]** Because, I mean, we have two courts going on here.

**[01:00:20 - 01:00:20]** I think Will's got it in the house.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** I think, yeah.

**[01:00:22 - 01:00:23]** I think Will's definitely got it in the house.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]** That's actually behind the curtain over there.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:25]** There you go.


## Speaker_0

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:25]** Perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:25 - 01:00:26]** All right.

**[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]** This is what you know.

**[01:00:29 - 01:00:33]** You know that they are constructs, technological constructs.

**[01:00:33 - 01:00:38]** You recognize these to be observer class security robots.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:42]** I relay this information to the team.

**[01:00:42 - 01:00:48]** I say, hey, these are constructs, observer, security droid things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:54]** I believe you, because of your super high roll, which is outrageous, you get a couple of things.

**[01:00:54 - 01:00:54]** Thank you.

**[01:00:55 - 01:01:00]** And because you had a 33, I think, with the team.

**[01:01:00 - 01:01:02]** So that's, hold on one second.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:03]** I think you get like three things.

**[01:01:03 - 01:01:07]** So is there anything in particular you want to know or do you just want me to tell you?

**[01:01:07 - 01:01:15]** Are they susceptible to any type of... Yes, they are vulnerable to critical hits and they're vulnerable to electricity.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** Okay.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:19]** That is two things.

**[01:01:19 - 01:01:20]** You get one more thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:29]** Do they have any... Are they immune to any type of attacks, damages, damage?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:34]** They are immune to whatever constructs are immune to.

**[01:01:34 - 01:01:40]** And I'm stalling because I'm typing into my search bar.

**[01:01:41 - 01:01:50]** And they are immune to bleed, death effects, disease, mind affecting effects, necromancy effects, paralysis, poison, sleep, and stun.

**[01:01:50 - 01:01:51]** What about acid?

**[01:01:51 - 01:01:53]** A bunch of other stuff.

**[01:01:53 - 01:01:56]** Ability drain, ability, energy drain, exhaustion, fatigue, acid.

**[01:01:57 - 01:01:57]** Well, poison.

**[01:01:58 - 01:02:00]** So acid, probably, yes, but they cannot be poisoned.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:01]** Right.

**[01:02:01 - 01:02:02]** In that way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:02:02 - 01:02:04]** So biohacks aren't going to do anything for them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:05 - 01:02:06]** Yeah, I don't think so.

**[01:02:06 - 01:02:07]** So what do you want to do on your turn?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:08]** Oh, yeah.

**[01:02:08 - 01:02:09]** Nico.

**[01:02:09 - 01:02:11]** One real quick, just for flavor's sake.

**[01:02:11 - 01:02:17]** As he calls that out, due to my profession and time at Orion Weapon Industries.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:18]** Yeah, we'll get there on your turn.

**[01:02:18 - 01:02:21]** Can we add like one more, get one more bonus thing?

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:23]** Like how does it usually attack?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:23 - 01:02:26]** It's not flavor if you're asking for something to actually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:26 - 01:02:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_0

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:27]** Oh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:27 - 01:02:33]** I think on your turn, if you want to do an identify thing, I can give you something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:02:34 - 01:02:36]** As an immediate recognition type of thing.

**[01:02:36 - 01:02:40]** If you're going to make me roll for it, then I'm not going to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:02:41 - 01:02:42]** Do it on your turn.

**[01:02:42 - 01:02:45]** That's how initiative works.

**[01:02:45 - 01:02:47]** You're caught off guard by this.

**[01:02:47 - 01:02:53]** So when Niko is then conscious and aware of what's going on, it's so many seconds later.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:02:53 - 01:02:56]** Slash, it's like all within the six seconds.

**[01:02:56 - 01:02:58]** You're going to use the six seconds to do the same thing.

**[01:02:59 - 01:03:02]** So just like when it's your turn, I'll just tell you one of those things.

**[01:03:02 - 01:03:03]** Because I definitely agree.

**[01:03:03 - 01:03:06]** I think you getting an extra one, totally fine.

**[01:03:06 - 01:03:07]** Okay.

**[01:03:07 - 01:03:08]** We support you, Dick.

**[01:03:08 - 01:03:09]** Yeah.

**[01:03:09 - 01:03:11]** It just has to be within the rules of the game.

**[01:03:12 - 01:03:14]** Nick always asks for things not in the game.

**[01:03:15 - 01:03:16]** Really cool, bro.

**[01:03:16 - 01:03:16]** Real cool.

**[01:03:17 - 01:03:18]** I think it's cool.

**[01:03:18 - 01:03:19]** Not in this game.

**[01:03:19 - 01:03:20]** I had already thought about it beforehand.

**[01:03:20 - 01:03:23]** I was like, oh, Nico's going to get something extra from it.

**[01:03:23 - 01:03:24]** I think that's a good way to do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:03:24 - 01:03:28]** No, John and I were joking about this recently about whether or not we're a...

**[01:03:28 - 01:03:44]** a raw game rules as written or like the truth is like we're mostly raw we follow the rules unless it's like something like a magic missile or whatever going non-lethal um and so for the most part we are i would say we're actually like a medium rare

**[01:03:44 - 01:03:46]** rules game.

**[01:03:46 - 01:03:51]** So yes, we will let you do weird things, but it has to still apply to the book.

**[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]** Yep, exactly.

**[01:03:52 - 01:03:53]** Oh, Will likes it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:03:53 - 01:03:55]** Medium rare?

**[01:03:55 - 01:03:59]** So which side's rare and which side's... The mediums?

**[01:04:00 - 01:04:01]** ...is more well done?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:01 - 01:04:03]** Well, the term raw...

**[01:04:02 - 01:04:05]** Which would just be super rare.

**[01:04:05 - 01:04:07]** It's rules as written.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:07 - 01:04:09]** The word raw just in general just sounds wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]** It sounds wrong?

**[01:04:11 - 01:04:12]** Wrong.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:12 - 01:04:13]** That is not ground truth.

**[01:04:13 - 01:04:14]** Not punny enough.

**[01:04:14 - 01:04:15]** Not punny enough.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:04:16 - 01:04:19]** We didn't decide whether we were going to do... That's more of a play on words than a pun anyway.

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:19]** I looked up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:04:19 - 01:04:22]** There's no good synonyms for that word that we talked about.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:22]** All right.

**[01:04:22 - 01:04:23]** We'll figure it out.

**[01:04:23 - 01:04:25]** So... Ascendancy.

**[01:04:25 - 01:04:27]** That seems... We'll grant ascendancy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:04:27 - 01:04:29]** We'll grant ascendancy.

**[01:04:30 - 01:04:31]** From the host god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:32 - 01:04:34]** It's, like, a little intense.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:34]** Dr.

**[01:04:34 - 01:04:35]** O.K., what are you doing on your turn?

**[01:04:35 - 01:04:36]** Let's get it going.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:36]** Dr.

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:36]** O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:36 - 01:04:40]** 's gonna draw his... Well, he had his spear out.

**[01:04:40 - 01:04:41]** Yeah.

**[01:04:41 - 01:04:42]** But...

**[01:04:42 - 01:04:46]** He's going to use, I guess, his move sort of action to put it away.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:46 - 01:04:48]** I am so silly.

**[01:04:49 - 01:04:50]** Dr. K, you rolled a seven, right?

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:51]** For what?

**[01:04:51 - 01:04:52]** On your initiative?

**[01:04:53 - 01:04:55]** No, 14, I believe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:56]** I rolled a 20.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:56 - 01:04:57]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:57 - 01:04:57]** Or 15.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:04:58 - 01:04:59]** You rolled a 15?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:04:59 - 01:05:00]** Okay.

**[01:05:00 - 01:05:01]** I thought...

**[01:05:02 - 01:05:03]** It should be Rick's turn.

**[01:05:03 - 01:05:04]** I don't know why I said Dr. K's turn.

**[01:05:04 - 01:05:06]** I thought Rick rolled hair.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:07]** That's fine.

**[01:05:07 - 01:05:13]** I just thought I might have been in a surprise round because of the trap thing, but I didn't want to push it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:13]** Oh, good point.

**[01:05:13 - 01:05:17]** No, you just noticed the ceiling and not the... Yeah, whatever.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:17 - 01:05:17]** That's fine.

**[01:05:18 - 01:05:24]** Okay, so then can I do some kind of check to see if these things are hostile currently, or is it just no...

**[01:05:24 - 01:05:25]** Sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:05:25 - 01:05:29]** They're like from the... You can tell like the noises that they're making.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:05:29 - 01:05:31]** Also, Rick understands what they're saying.

**[01:05:31 - 01:05:32]** That's not what I was saying.

**[01:05:32 - 01:05:33]** That's not what I was saying.

**[01:05:33 - 01:05:37]** You just said from the... Those are hostile beeps.

**[01:05:37 - 01:05:39]** Those are hostile beeps.

**[01:05:39 - 01:05:40]** Everyone in the room knows it.

**[01:05:40 - 01:05:42]** But the eyes are blue, not red.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:42]** Listen.

**[01:05:42 - 01:05:46]** I have a washing machine that plays a song at the end, and it's really nice and pleasant.

**[01:05:47 - 01:05:48]** This is not the song.

**[01:05:48 - 01:05:49]** This is not that song!

**[01:05:50 - 01:05:52]** Rick, can you negotiate with your brethren?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:05:52 - 01:05:58]** Yeah, Rick goes... And they're like, oh, okay, sorry, sorry.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:05:58 - 01:06:04]** They're going to respond hostile because you didn't respond with Beethoven, okay?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:06:04 - 01:06:07]** What are you doing in that weird beep thing?

**[01:06:07 - 01:06:09]** Oh, man, can I?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:06:11 - 01:06:12]** Rule of cool, do it!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:14 - 01:06:16]** That's on the... I do have a plus three in bluff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:17 - 01:06:24]** Rick is going to... I don't think that that would be a bluff per se.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:24 - 01:06:31]** I feel like it would be... You can use your words and actions to create distractions, misdirect your opponents, tell convincing lies, and pass along secret messages.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:31 - 01:06:35]** I'm going to go with engineering or computers, but if you want to try bluff, you can try it.

**[01:06:35 - 01:06:36]** I don't have computers.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:06:36 - 01:06:37]** Diversion, right?

**[01:06:37 - 01:06:38]** Is that what you're trying to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:39]** Faint.

**[01:06:39 - 01:06:41]** It's a standard action, though.

**[01:06:41 - 01:06:42]** It wastes my attack.

**[01:06:43 - 01:06:45]** You can use a bluff to feint an enemy.

**[01:06:45 - 01:06:46]** This is the longest turn.

**[01:06:46 - 01:06:47]** I know.

**[01:06:48 - 01:06:50]** They're hostile.

**[01:06:50 - 01:06:51]** It's established they're hostile.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:06:52 - 01:06:54]** I'm not saying you can't do the bluff.

**[01:06:54 - 01:06:57]** I'm just saying let's do the bluff first.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:06:57 - 01:06:59]** No, I'm trying to avoid the murder bot thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:00 - 01:07:01]** Just be what you are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:01 - 01:07:02]** No, you know what?

**[01:07:02 - 01:07:03]** I'm going to do it.

**[01:07:03 - 01:07:04]** We accept you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:04 - 01:07:05]** That's fine.

**[01:07:05 - 01:07:07]** We could actually use that right now, to be honest.

**[01:07:07 - 01:07:08]** What?

**[01:07:08 - 01:07:11]** I mean, if you're a murder bot, just be one.

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:12]** Be it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:12 - 01:07:21]** You see him twitch as if he's going to kill these things, but he pauses and he readies an action to wait until he's attacked.

**[01:07:21 - 01:07:28]** My action is if they were to attack any of the four of us, then Rick will then gun murder bot on them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:07:29 - 01:07:31]** So you will change initiative order.

**[01:07:31 - 01:07:33]** You will be at the new initiative order.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:07:34 - 01:07:39]** My initiative will then... Since I'm not doing a complete defensive attack, my initiative will then come after...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:07:39 - 01:07:59]** right it will come after whatever action whichever robot and then yeah so like if the robot attacks whatever then you will go after and then you will be confused wait okay so you basically just said i'm not going to attack them first even though i know they're aggressive is that what you just said i mean i i'm i'm not a murder bot but like

**[01:07:59 - 01:08:02]** Okay, but you don't have to pendulum swing all this way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:02 - 01:08:09]** The pressure is hampering the party as they are attacked in the unknown room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:09 - 01:08:10]** It is so funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:08:10 - 01:08:13]** Wait, you're not even going to bluff them?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:14 - 01:08:16]** So bluffing takes an action.

**[01:08:16 - 01:08:17]** So you're going to do that instead of attack.

**[01:08:18 - 01:08:22]** No, because if I try to bluff them instead of attack, then I waste my attack moves.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:22 - 01:08:23]** So you're not going to do anything is what you're saying.

**[01:08:23 - 01:08:24]** I'm delaying my action.

**[01:08:24 - 01:08:25]** You're delaying an action.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:25 - 01:08:27]** So I can attack once they attack.

**[01:08:27 - 01:08:33]** So if you guys have some kind of bluff or something you want to do to stop these things from attacking, I don't have to hit them.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:33 - 01:08:35]** Otherwise, I'm going to just swing this thing like a baseball bat.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:35]** I don't think I could.

**[01:08:35 - 01:08:36]** I got you.

**[01:08:36 - 01:08:37]** I got what you're saying.

**[01:08:37 - 01:08:37]** But still.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:38]** All right.

**[01:08:38 - 01:08:39]** Well, anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:39 - 01:08:40]** This is what you guys get.

**[01:08:40 - 01:08:41]** Call him a murder bot.

**[01:08:41 - 01:08:42]** He's going to prove he's not.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_06

**[01:08:42 - 01:08:43]** Man, what have we done?

**[01:08:43 - 01:08:44]** That's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[01:08:44 - 01:08:45]** It's so funny because we're over here.

**[01:08:45 - 01:08:47]** Meanwhile, Nico's like, oh, they're both liabilities.

**[01:08:47 - 01:08:48]** Ba-da-da-da-da.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:08:49 - 01:08:52]** That's exactly what I'm going to do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:08:52 - 01:09:13]** So as you guys are arguing, the robot directly in front of Rick, a small panel opens, and this pistol comes out, points right at you, and you hear like, and that is our game.

**[01:09:13 - 01:09:14]** What?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:09:15 - 01:09:15]** No!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:16 - 01:09:19]** We spent so much time arguing about bullshit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_07

**[01:09:19 - 01:09:23]** Seriously though, it was so funny because it was so funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[01:09:26 - 01:09:28]** Hey there, friendly neighborhood listener.

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:29]** How you doing?

**[01:09:29 - 01:09:39]** I'm glad to see you here at the table because I just want to tell you that it has been awesome to get to interact with you over Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and even Discord now.

**[01:09:39 - 01:09:40]** Join our Discord.

**[01:09:41 - 01:09:42]** Look, we're going to be at Gen Con in a few weeks.

**[01:09:42 - 01:09:45]** If you see us, we're going to be wearing some cool hats and t-shirts.

**[01:09:45 - 01:09:46]** Come up and say hi.

**[01:09:47 - 01:09:48]** If you can't go, give us a shout.

**[01:09:49 - 01:09:51]** Wherever you are in the world, we want to hear from you.

**[01:09:51 - 01:09:55]** Until then, we'll see you next week.


## Speaker_0

**[01:10:00 - 01:10:02]** Thank you.
