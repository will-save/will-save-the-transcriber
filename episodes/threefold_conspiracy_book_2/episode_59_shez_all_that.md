**[00:00:00 - 00:00:02]** Previously, on Will Save.

**[00:00:03 - 00:00:19]** Our cadre carefully examine their companion hears his likeness in the hologram before them, and after careful examination, the doctor spots the telltale signs of a gray trickery afoot, sparking our crew to carry onward down the shaft just outside the room.

**[00:00:19 - 00:00:38]** Halfway down, and with the murder bot outside on Overwatch, Bernice hears and the doctor decide to take a detour to discover where this little hallway heads, only halting their spelunking after encountering an open doorway and the subtle sign of a sensor probing the other half of the shaft.

**[00:00:38 - 00:00:47]** In a tight squeeze and with no answers, the cave divers decide to call out to the stewards and their new friend Shay for some answers.

**[00:00:47 - 00:00:51]** Will our adventures find some sense courtesy of our Stuart friends?

**[00:00:52 - 00:00:57]** Or are these shenanigans the last straw before our friends get the final shaft?

**[00:00:57 - 00:01:00]** Find out this time on We'll Save.

**[00:01:00 - 00:01:02]** We'll Save.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:01:50 - 00:01:52]** All right, I'm just going to jump right into it.

**[00:01:52 - 00:01:56]** Kelly, tell us that story that you said that you were going to tell us last week on episode 58.

**[00:01:57 - 00:02:03]** And I've been waiting all week on the edge of my seat to hear it.

**[00:02:03 - 00:02:06]** Yeah, a whole week to hear about your PJ stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:02:06 - 00:02:07]** Oh, pajamas, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:02:07 - 00:02:08]** Pajamas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:08 - 00:02:11]** Tell me if your moms or your dads do something like this.

**[00:02:11 - 00:02:16]** But my mom, like, has subtle little ways of getting, like, a dig in at us.

**[00:02:17 - 00:02:24]** And one such way, apparently, is we always get, like, pajamas, like, during Christmas as, like, a thing, you know?

**[00:02:24 - 00:02:30]** And then she would always, like, the pajamas would always be themed after, like, our fights with mom for that year.

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:30]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:02:30 - 00:02:32]** So then they always are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:02:33 - 00:02:34]** Amazing.

**[00:02:34 - 00:02:35]** That's amazing.

**[00:02:35 - 00:02:40]** There was one good year where my mom and I fought a lot.

**[00:02:40 - 00:02:42]** And then like, you know, growing teenagers.

**[00:02:42 - 00:02:44]** And she gave me like Stewie from Family Guy.

**[00:02:44 - 00:02:45]** But he was like, I'm the boss.

**[00:02:45 - 00:02:48]** I'm the boss of everything.

**[00:02:48 - 00:02:49]** You're wrong.

**[00:02:49 - 00:02:51]** He was saying stuff like that all over the pajamas.

**[00:02:52 - 00:03:13]** oh i got so and then one year so good one year like we go up such a troll thing for your money one year we're we go up north uh to the forest basically every every year and so we were coming back this one time and i was like you know i really want to be a a dog sled racer i really want to race in a in the iditarod oh


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:13 - 00:03:16]** Oh, because we talked about the dog sled pajamas.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:16 - 00:03:24]** And then my mom and my sister were in the car and they're like, Kelly, you will never, ever win a dog sled race.

**[00:03:24 - 00:03:25]** Oh, my God.

**[00:03:25 - 00:03:26]** That's your origin story.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:26]** I know.

**[00:03:26 - 00:03:28]** And they got really, really into it.

**[00:03:28 - 00:03:30]** And then we got very technical about the arguments.

**[00:03:30 - 00:03:31]** We're talking about the weight.

**[00:03:32 - 00:03:33]** We're talking about the culture that we grew up in.

**[00:03:33 - 00:03:35]** And they're like, you're too tall.

**[00:03:35 - 00:03:36]** Yeah.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:36]** Yeah, too tall.

**[00:03:36 - 00:03:37]** That was like a big argument.

**[00:03:38 - 00:03:39]** And then they're like, no, you're just way too much.

**[00:03:39 - 00:03:41]** And I was like, well, I can just get more dogs.

**[00:03:41 - 00:03:42]** I don't know what the rules are.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:03:42 - 00:03:43]** Get bigger dogs.

**[00:03:43 - 00:03:44]** Get more dogs.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:44]** Use like St.

**[00:03:44 - 00:03:46]** Bernard's instead of Huskies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:03:46 - 00:03:52]** But like being like, I was like, like one time, maybe it's an American thing.

**[00:03:52 - 00:03:54]** Like, I know that we're like, we're just like, we could do it.

**[00:03:54 - 00:03:57]** Like, so I'm just like, I'm just like, I want to do this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:03:57 - 00:04:00]** No, how dare you tell me I can't do something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:00]** Exactly.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:00 - 00:04:01]** Am I?

**[00:04:01 - 00:04:08]** My cousin just posted on on like Facebook a little bit ago about how he went dog sledding and it was right He had a great crazy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:04:09 - 00:04:25]** This is what I Kelly's Well, I'll have to talk to your friend but but basically Basically, so I thought I was thinking and telling them no These are the ways that could win the I did a ride or at least like get really high up You know in place whatever at least finish a race, but definitely win.

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:25]** I

**[00:04:25 - 00:04:36]** And then basically my mom was like, Kelly, you had better, I swear to God, you had better win the Iditarod for all that you've talked about this.

**[00:04:37 - 00:04:40]** And then Christmas rolled around, I don't know, seven months later even.

**[00:04:40 - 00:04:46]** And then I got these really nice dog sled pajamas.

**[00:04:46 - 00:04:48]** And then like, they're actually my favorite pajama pants.

**[00:04:48 - 00:04:49]** Thanks mom.

**[00:04:49 - 00:04:52]** Because they're really, really, you would imagine very warm.

**[00:04:52 - 00:04:54]** They're like lined and everything and very fluffy.

**[00:04:55 - 00:04:56]** The most fluffy.

**[00:04:56 - 00:04:58]** Cause you know, it's cold in Alaska.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:04:58 - 00:05:03]** It'd be much more like, like petty and dramatic if you got those like this year.

**[00:05:03 - 00:05:05]** This last Christmas?

**[00:05:05 - 00:05:06]** Ten years later?

**[00:05:06 - 00:05:08]** By the way, you still haven't won.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:09 - 00:05:12]** Kelly, I haven't seen you on the news.

**[00:05:12 - 00:05:15]** On the Alaska local news that you've won the Iditarod.

**[00:05:15 - 00:05:16]** Just a reminder.

**[00:05:17 - 00:05:18]** Anyway, it is a goal of mine.

**[00:05:18 - 00:05:22]** Therefore, to go to racing.

**[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]** To be on the Alaska news.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:24 - 00:05:29]** I honestly think, though, for you to get into the sport of dog sledding, you're going to have to move out of Southern California.

**[00:05:30 - 00:05:31]** That's just going to...

**[00:05:31 - 00:05:32]** That's holding you back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:32 - 00:05:33]** This is true.

**[00:05:33 - 00:05:36]** I will have to live there for like a year to train or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:36 - 00:05:38]** Unless they have sleds on rollerblades.

**[00:05:38 - 00:05:40]** It could be a cool running situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:05:40 - 00:05:42]** It could be a cool running situation.

**[00:05:42 - 00:05:43]** Feel the rhythm!


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:05:43 - 00:05:44]** Feel the ride!

**[00:05:44 - 00:05:48]** You're practicing here, but then you go compete.

**[00:05:48 - 00:05:49]** Can you be my team?

**[00:05:49 - 00:05:51]** Can you help me?

**[00:05:51 - 00:05:53]** in my own petty way, get back at my mom.

**[00:05:53 - 00:05:54]** Let's do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:05:54 - 00:05:54]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:05:55 - 00:05:55]** Yeah.

**[00:05:55 - 00:06:01]** I will host an annual dog race and I will advertise it in Canada.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]** I feel like this is a, this is like a Disney movie waiting to happen.

**[00:06:04 - 00:06:06]** We're like, it's not even, you don't even get Huskies.

**[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]** You have like dachshunds and corgis.

**[00:06:09 - 00:06:10]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:06:10 - 00:06:16]** And they pull little dolls of us across the yard.

**[00:06:16 - 00:06:18]** Shelly will win, undoubtedly.

**[00:06:18 - 00:06:19]** I did a rad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:06:20 - 00:06:22]** Oh, I did a rad is a great name.

**[00:06:22 - 00:06:24]** It's a great name for a Disney movie.

**[00:06:24 - 00:06:25]** It will be rad.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:26 - 00:06:28]** Yeah, we need cool sayings.

**[00:06:28 - 00:06:29]** I know you're listening, Disney.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:30]** Make this happen.

**[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]** Kev, don't say that.

**[00:06:32 - 00:06:35]** Sorry, I'm getting a call right now.

**[00:06:35 - 00:06:37]** It's an unknown number.

**[00:06:37 - 00:06:38]** It's an unidentified number.

**[00:06:38 - 00:06:40]** Do any of you all have things like this?

**[00:06:41 - 00:06:43]** Petty grievances against our family?

**[00:06:43 - 00:06:47]** Or aspirations that I still haven't attained that I still hold from as a child.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:48 - 00:06:48]** Yeah.

**[00:06:49 - 00:06:50]** I want an IMDb.

**[00:06:50 - 00:06:53]** I was a background actor for a while and never got it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:06:53 - 00:06:54]** You've got to say something.

**[00:06:54 - 00:06:54]** Oh, you want to.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:06:55 - 00:06:55]** I know.

**[00:06:55 - 00:07:02]** It turned out one of my coworkers pointed out that one of our other coworkers, she's been making movies for years.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:02]** Oh.

**[00:07:02 - 00:07:06]** And she's got a full list of IMDbs from the small films she made.

**[00:07:06 - 00:07:08]** And I'm like, man, I've got to start making small movies.

**[00:07:08 - 00:07:11]** If she's with SAG, then you can just do it.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:11]** I don't think she's SAG.

**[00:07:11 - 00:07:13]** I think she's an independent filmmaker.

**[00:07:13 - 00:07:14]** But it still works.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:15 - 00:07:16]** It still works.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:16]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:07:16 - 00:07:17]** One day.

**[00:07:17 - 00:07:20]** By the time I die, I want at least one entry on my NDP.

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:20]** That's all.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:20 - 00:07:21]** Okay.

**[00:07:21 - 00:07:22]** I like that goal.

**[00:07:22 - 00:07:23]** I like it.

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:23]** It's a good goal.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:23 - 00:07:25]** Will, do you have anything?

**[00:07:26 - 00:07:29]** Do I have any accomplishments that I've yet to realize?

**[00:07:30 - 00:07:32]** Yeah, that as a kid you were like, yeah, totally.

**[00:07:33 - 00:07:37]** I mean, I wanted to be a professional basketball player as a kid.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:38]** That's cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:38 - 00:07:39]** That one's going to be a stretch.

**[00:07:39 - 00:07:41]** Now I don't think it's going to be.


## Speaker_0

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:41]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:07:41 - 00:07:44]** I feel like we've never shot some hoops.

**[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]** I feel like we need like a Will State Olympics or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:07:46 - 00:07:49]** I feel like I'm really terrible at basketball.

**[00:07:51 - 00:07:52]** I foul a lot and I don't mean to.

**[00:07:53 - 00:07:57]** And I apologize for everyone that I play basketball with who I've elbowed into the face.

**[00:07:57 - 00:07:59]** Why don't we just warm up with horse then?

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:00]** It's fine.

**[00:08:00 - 00:08:01]** Or with Oma.

**[00:08:01 - 00:08:01]** We can play horse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:02 - 00:08:03]** What is horse?

**[00:08:04 - 00:08:06]** That's like a type of basketball that you play.

**[00:08:06 - 00:08:07]** Or just ride a horse.

**[00:08:08 - 00:08:09]** It's a simple game.

**[00:08:09 - 00:08:10]** Is it basketball on horses?

**[00:08:10 - 00:08:11]** Like pull up a basketball horse?

**[00:08:11 - 00:08:15]** Kelly, have you never played horse?

**[00:08:15 - 00:08:16]** You've never played horse?

**[00:08:17 - 00:08:17]** I don't think so.

**[00:08:18 - 00:08:21]** That sounds familiar, but it's been so long since I've played basketball.

**[00:08:22 - 00:08:24]** It is a game where you bring in a live horse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:24 - 00:08:26]** You bring in a live horse onto the court.

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:27]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:27 - 00:08:30]** And then that's why where I lived, we didn't have enough horses.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:08:30 - 00:08:33]** You shoot from its back on horseback.

**[00:08:33 - 00:08:34]** You shoot on horseback.

**[00:08:34 - 00:08:35]** You shoot from horseback.

**[00:08:35 - 00:08:36]** That's why I've told horse.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:37 - 00:08:52]** I just want to point out, John and I have a friend, Justin, that in high school played against Lonzo Ball and actually has a picture of him blocking Lonzo Ball who plays for the Lakers now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:08:52 - 00:08:53]** Wait, what?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:08:53 - 00:08:54]** And he's so humble about it.

**[00:08:54 - 00:08:56]** Like, no, don't point that out.

**[00:08:56 - 00:08:57]** Like, nobody needs to know about this.

**[00:08:57 - 00:09:00]** But Justin Gaither is a basketball legend.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:00 - 00:09:01]** And we will ask him.

**[00:09:02 - 00:09:04]** Stuff on a pro.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:04 - 00:09:04]** Right?

**[00:09:05 - 00:09:07]** I know he doesn't listen to the show.

**[00:09:07 - 00:09:09]** But we will ask him if he wants to be mentioned.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:09 - 00:09:11]** And if not, this whole thing will be bleeped.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:11 - 00:09:12]** And it'll be fine.

**[00:09:12 - 00:09:13]** That's actually what I really want.

**[00:09:13 - 00:09:16]** I don't actually want any sort of accolade or award.

**[00:09:17 - 00:09:20]** I really just want to dunk on somebody like once.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:21 - 00:09:25]** I think if you dunk on Justin by association, you will have dunked on.

**[00:09:26 - 00:09:27]** Yeah, that's how that works.

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:27]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:27 - 00:09:29]** Yeah, that makes sense.

**[00:09:29 - 00:09:30]** Perfect.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:30]** That's pretty awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:09:30 - 00:09:33]** A is greater than B is greater than C kind of situation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:33 - 00:09:38]** I just want a word of mouth to go around about my greatness on the basketball court.

**[00:09:38 - 00:09:39]** That's it.

**[00:09:39 - 00:09:44]** Dude, yeah, we'll just tell people, oh, man, you don't want to play against Will, but you never show up to the game.

**[00:09:44 - 00:09:45]** He's 6'3".

**[00:09:45 - 00:09:46]** We can totally do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:09:46 - 00:09:49]** He has like 18, 20-inch reach above everywhere.

**[00:09:49 - 00:09:50]** We'll turn down the draft.

**[00:09:50 - 00:09:53]** We have to start this now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:09:53 - 00:09:54]** We have to start.

**[00:09:54 - 00:09:56]** He was drafted to the Bulls next to Michael Jordan.

**[00:09:56 - 00:09:57]** Yeah, that's it.

**[00:09:57 - 00:09:58]** He was like, no thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:09:58 - 00:09:59]** Wow.

**[00:09:59 - 00:10:00]** That means you're pretty old.

**[00:10:01 - 00:10:02]** I love that idea.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:02 - 00:10:03]** You're old.

**[00:10:03 - 00:10:05]** Sorry, I don't know basketball.

**[00:10:05 - 00:10:06]** That's the only name I can think of.

**[00:10:06 - 00:10:07]** What about you, John?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:08 - 00:10:09]** I was hoping to hit let's play.

**[00:10:10 - 00:10:12]** Oh, now I feel like I need a let's play button.

**[00:10:13 - 00:10:15]** Like a little let's play drop.

**[00:10:15 - 00:10:16]** Let's play.

**[00:10:16 - 00:10:17]** Mortal Kombat style.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:10:17 - 00:10:20]** I know we might be spending too much time talking about this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:21 - 00:10:22]** That's Will's button for when he wants us to move on.

**[00:10:24 - 00:10:26]** But I want to know John's aspiration.

**[00:10:26 - 00:10:27]** I'll say it, and then we should play.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:10:28 - 00:10:33]** I'll say it, and it's that I really... No explanation, and we just cut straight to the action?

**[00:10:34 - 00:10:35]** And we just cut right to it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:10:35 - 00:10:36]** We should speak to the rules.

**[00:10:36 - 00:10:37]** Is that a new house rule?

**[00:10:37 - 00:10:39]** I'll put it in the notes.

**[00:10:39 - 00:10:43]** As soon as John says let's play, we stop everything and start playing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:10:43 - 00:10:43]** No, come on.

**[00:10:44 - 00:10:46]** That can't be done.

**[00:10:46 - 00:10:50]** I wasn't even going to go to college.

**[00:10:50 - 00:10:51]** I looked it up.

**[00:10:52 - 00:10:53]** I found the place.

**[00:10:54 - 00:10:55]** I knew what I was going to do.

**[00:10:55 - 00:11:01]** I was going to graduate high school, going to go train in the Shaolin Monastery.

**[00:11:01 - 00:11:05]** Then I was going to move to a big city and I was going to be a defender.

**[00:11:05 - 00:11:08]** I was going to work and do whatever.

**[00:11:08 - 00:11:10]** And I wanted to train.

**[00:11:10 - 00:11:13]** I watched videos because this was before YouTube was super big.

**[00:11:13 - 00:11:15]** So I was reading all about it.

**[00:11:15 - 00:11:16]** I found a place.

**[00:11:16 - 00:11:18]** I found how much it cost.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:18]** I told my parents.

**[00:11:18 - 00:11:19]** And then, yeah.

**[00:11:20 - 00:11:22]** And then I went to music school anyway.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:11:23 - 00:11:24]** There's like a cost to be a Shaolin monk?

**[00:11:24 - 00:11:26]** Yeah, you had to pay to go there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:26 - 00:11:27]** That's awesome.

**[00:11:28 - 00:11:29]** My old friend did it.

**[00:11:29 - 00:11:30]** What do you mean a defender?

**[00:11:31 - 00:11:32]** What, like a superhero?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:32 - 00:11:35]** Yeah, like I was going to go help out.

**[00:11:35 - 00:11:38]** Yeah, but the problem is the octopus is not well-received, so it's fine.

**[00:11:38 - 00:11:39]** It's all good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:40 - 00:11:42]** I've had similar dreams.

**[00:11:42 - 00:11:44]** I like that dream a lot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:44 - 00:11:48]** He went to a monastery in northern China and studied Kung Fu for like three years.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:11:48 - 00:11:49]** See, that's freaking cool.

**[00:11:49 - 00:11:50]** That's super awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:11:51 - 00:11:52]** And then he got like

**[00:11:52 - 00:11:57]** appendicitis and then they try to give him some like beetroot and he's like, no, I need Western medicine.

**[00:11:57 - 00:11:58]** And then he's like, screw cum.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:11:58 - 00:11:59]** Okay.

**[00:12:01 - 00:12:02]** That is, that's actually really good.

**[00:12:02 - 00:12:04]** Well, there you go, John, at least you're alive.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:04 - 00:12:06]** So at least I didn't get appendicitis and I'm alive.

**[00:12:06 - 00:12:07]** Yeah.

**[00:12:08 - 00:12:08]** So that's what it was.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:09]** Yeah.

**[00:12:09 - 00:12:10]** But I can go more into it.

**[00:12:10 - 00:12:11]** I would love to talk to martial arts.

**[00:12:12 - 00:12:13]** Definitely on or off air.

**[00:12:13 - 00:12:14]** It'd be really fun.

**[00:12:14 - 00:12:16]** We should, we should talk about that next week.

**[00:12:17 - 00:12:18]** Till then though.

**[00:12:19 - 00:12:19]** Let's play.

**[00:12:20 - 00:12:20]** Let's play.

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:22]** Oh,

**[00:12:22 - 00:12:23]** Drop the beat.

**[00:12:23 - 00:12:25]** Drop the let's play beat.

**[00:12:25 - 00:12:26]** There's no let's play beat.

**[00:12:26 - 00:12:27]** Here we go.

**[00:12:27 - 00:12:28]** That's what it is.

**[00:12:29 - 00:12:31]** That's the let's play beat.

**[00:12:31 - 00:12:31]** That's it.

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:32]** That's it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:32 - 00:12:33]** I love that.

**[00:12:33 - 00:12:34]** I don't know.

**[00:12:34 - 00:12:35]** A lot of our listeners, I have no idea.

**[00:12:35 - 00:12:39]** Please tell us if you know what California Gold is and who Heal Housers is.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:40]** Just look it up.

**[00:12:40 - 00:12:41]** Do it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:41]** Watch it.

**[00:12:41 - 00:12:42]** Yeah, look it up because it's great.

**[00:12:43 - 00:12:50]** But I just think it's hilarious that Will has an entire sound deck of everything Heal Housers ever said.

**[00:12:50 - 00:12:51]** It's funny.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:51 - 00:12:52]** Thanks.

**[00:12:52 - 00:12:53]** I love it.

**[00:12:53 - 00:12:54]** It's great.

**[00:12:54 - 00:12:55]** RIP Huel.

**[00:12:55 - 00:12:55]** You are missed.

**[00:12:56 - 00:12:57]** We're glad you're with us in spirit.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:12:58 - 00:12:59]** Glad you're with us every week.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:12:59 - 00:12:59]** Always.

**[00:13:00 - 00:13:00]** Only here on Wholesale.

**[00:13:01 - 00:13:02]** The Huel is with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:02 - 00:13:03]** This is a strange.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:04 - 00:13:04]** And also with you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:05 - 00:13:06]** This is a strange place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:07 - 00:13:11]** And with all of you times a thousand.

**[00:13:11 - 00:13:11]** All of you.

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:12]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:12 - 00:13:13]** All right.

**[00:13:13 - 00:13:14]** Times a thousand and one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:13:14 - 00:13:15]** Yeah.

**[00:13:15 - 00:13:16]** Okay.

**[00:13:16 - 00:13:18]** Times to the thousandth power.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:13:18 - 00:13:21]** Now that's an avocado-eating dog.

**[00:13:22 - 00:13:23]** Couldn't say it better myself.

**[00:13:24 - 00:13:24]** Nice.

**[00:13:25 - 00:13:40]** So, last week, after an unsettling discovery of not only an image that was aboard the now presumably blown-up Chimera showing up,

**[00:13:40 - 00:13:47]** in rooms away, who knows how far away on this little hollow emitter that you discovered in this control room.

**[00:13:48 - 00:13:59]** You also find an image of what appears to be here's in a business outfit in a crowd of people all looking towards him.

**[00:13:59 - 00:14:04]** And there's a word I keep wanting to say every time that I describe this, but I can't forget it.

**[00:14:04 - 00:14:06]** Like just amazed in awe.

**[00:14:09 - 00:14:11]** Come to find out, you do a little research.

**[00:14:12 - 00:14:13]** I think it's probably a city.

**[00:14:13 - 00:14:16]** At first glance, maybe it's Absalom.

**[00:14:17 - 00:14:25]** You notice that a jacket or a piece of an article of clothing has a picture of an Oma eating what looks like ice cream.

**[00:14:26 - 00:14:29]** You think, well, it sounds like it could be something from Leovara.

**[00:14:30 - 00:14:34]** Maybe that's a pretty common symbol there to put Omas on things, right?

**[00:14:35 - 00:14:37]** You also then look a little closer.

**[00:14:37 - 00:14:47]** Dr. O'Kay has the right sliver, the right perspective to see that there's a face of a gray, the only face in the crowd not looking towards business ears.

**[00:14:48 - 00:14:49]** Business ears.

**[00:14:49 - 00:14:52]** Looking right at the viewer of this photo.

**[00:14:53 - 00:14:54]** Feels like they're looking right at you.

**[00:14:56 - 00:15:00]** You say, all right, well, that's frigging weird.

**[00:15:01 - 00:15:03]** So we're going to put it in our pocket and

**[00:15:04 - 00:15:04]** GTFO.

**[00:15:05 - 00:15:14]** You go to the door, open up into a small octagonal chamber where for once you finally confirm, yep, this is the way down.

**[00:15:16 - 00:15:24]** There's a rock wall shaft that goes down with a narrow ladder and you're on your way to deactivate the reactors.

**[00:15:24 - 00:15:28]** When about 20 feet down, you notice a little

**[00:15:29 - 00:15:35]** three foot by five foot tunnel that seems to extend to the left and around the corner.

**[00:15:36 - 00:15:37]** Rick's like, I'm gonna stay here.

**[00:15:38 - 00:15:38]** Y'all have fun.

**[00:15:39 - 00:15:40]** Y'all be easy.

**[00:15:40 - 00:15:42]** And Bernice adheres.

**[00:15:43 - 00:15:43]** And Dr. O.K.

**[00:15:44 - 00:15:45]** head down the tunnel.

**[00:15:46 - 00:15:47]** Now you turn the corner.

**[00:15:48 - 00:15:49]** because you're like, this is curious.

**[00:15:49 - 00:15:53]** You remember the stewards said something about this.

**[00:15:53 - 00:15:56]** They were like, hey, when you see this, this is not it.

**[00:15:57 - 00:16:02]** You need to go down the shaft, get to the reactor, find your way down.

**[00:16:02 - 00:16:09]** And as you come around and Bernice is scouting ahead, you do see a door that is open and you put two and two together.

**[00:16:10 - 00:16:19]** That's the door you opened with the access with a control module up in the control room above, which is technically only 20 feet of solid rock above you, give or take.

**[00:16:19 - 00:16:20]** The door's open.

**[00:16:21 - 00:16:23]** Bernice doesn't notice, but Dr. O.K.

**[00:16:24 - 00:16:35]** realizes that there's a motion detector that is watching or impressed upon the shaft on the other side of the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:16:36 - 00:16:38]** And you're able to... Just for note...

**[00:16:38 - 00:16:46]** I perceive that this thing is working as a motion detector, but I have no idea how it works and how to disable it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:16:46 - 00:16:47]** Yeah.

**[00:16:47 - 00:16:48]** Not to say that you don't know.

**[00:16:48 - 00:16:54]** It doesn't seem like you can disable it from where you are here without going into it.

**[00:16:54 - 00:16:57]** So you say, all right, well, do we want to trip it?

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:57]** You know what?

**[00:16:57 - 00:16:59]** We're going to ask the stewards first.

**[00:17:00 - 00:17:01]** Because maybe we just need to head back.

**[00:17:02 - 00:17:03]** Maybe we go through here.

**[00:17:04 - 00:17:05]** Couldn't hurt to ask.

**[00:17:05 - 00:17:07]** So what is it that you said, Dr. O'Keefe?

**[00:17:07 - 00:17:08]** Could hurt to ask.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:08 - 00:17:09]** Could hurt to ask.

**[00:17:11 - 00:17:18]** Hey, we found this shaft because, well, the other shaft seemed kind of perilous.

**[00:17:20 - 00:17:21]** But there's a motion detector.

**[00:17:21 - 00:17:24]** Any insight into this motion detector?

**[00:17:24 - 00:17:25]** Hey, maybe, Shay, you could disable it.

**[00:17:27 - 00:17:28]** There is a pause button.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:31 - 00:17:34]** And then you hear this static grow louder.

**[00:17:34 - 00:17:36]** You mentioned this thing before.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:41 - 00:17:42]** Can you hear me?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:45]** Hello?

**[00:17:45 - 00:17:45]** Hello?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:17:47 - 00:17:47]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:17:51 - 00:17:52]** I can hear you.

**[00:17:52 - 00:17:56]** Doctor, okay, I guess that's... I guess that's you.

**[00:17:56 - 00:17:58]** Can you hear me, Shay?

**[00:17:58 - 00:17:59]** Yes.

**[00:18:00 - 00:18:04]** And the static for a minute seems to come down to a lower noise.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:04 - 00:18:05]** We are being jammed.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:06 - 00:18:09]** Look, can you repeat your question?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:11 - 00:18:12]** The shaft...

**[00:18:13 - 00:18:14]** The shaft.

**[00:18:14 - 00:18:15]** You found the shaft.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:16]** Yeah.

**[00:18:16 - 00:18:18]** Can we disable the grid?

**[00:18:18 - 00:18:20]** It's got motion detectors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:18:22 - 00:18:22]** Wait.

**[00:18:24 - 00:18:26]** Are you in the tunnel?

**[00:18:26 - 00:18:28]** Yeah, I told you not to go in there.

**[00:18:28 - 00:18:29]** Why did you?

**[00:18:29 - 00:18:30]** No, you said to go in there.

**[00:18:30 - 00:18:32]** No, why are you?

**[00:18:32 - 00:18:33]** The tunnel is.

**[00:18:33 - 00:18:36]** You said to not not go in there.

**[00:18:36 - 00:18:38]** I didn't say to not not go in there.

**[00:18:38 - 00:18:41]** Look, those are my motion detectors.

**[00:18:41 - 00:18:42]** What are you doing in the tunnel?

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:43]** You don't.

**[00:18:43 - 00:18:45]** What are you doing sending motion detectors?

**[00:18:45 - 00:18:46]** I'm watching my back.

**[00:18:46 - 00:18:48]** You think we're fucking amateurs here?

**[00:18:48 - 00:18:51]** Look, that's not the way to the reactor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:18:51 - 00:18:54]** Can I determine whether or not they're sense motive?

**[00:18:54 - 00:18:56]** Yeah, sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:18:57 - 00:18:58]** By minus one.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:18:59 - 00:18:59]** Thirteen.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:19:00 - 00:19:03]** Yeah, you can hear this too, Rick, because you're obviously on the comms.

**[00:19:03 - 00:19:04]** Eighteen?

**[00:19:04 - 00:19:05]** Eighteen from Dr. Okay.

**[00:19:06 - 00:19:07]** Rick got what?

**[00:19:07 - 00:19:36]** eight eight okay here's a 13 13 okay yeah it it seems like he is telling the truth he's like yeah i'm watching my back i am have lost men i am this is like standard protocol i need to cover my entrances for where we're going can i determine the origin of this motion detector based on its configuration or any of the effects that i can observe

**[00:19:36 - 00:19:38]** Uh, I mean, it's at the other end of the hall.

**[00:19:38 - 00:19:41]** Can I see if it's like humanoid or gray?

**[00:19:41 - 00:19:43]** Oh, it seems like it's humanoid.

**[00:19:43 - 00:19:49]** It seems like it's like a standard protocol from, from what you can tell, which is again, not too much.

**[00:19:49 - 00:19:50]** Yeah.

**[00:19:50 - 00:19:52]** It's like, it's probably some general thing.

**[00:19:53 - 00:19:56]** It doesn't seem like it's, you know, specialized in any way.

**[00:19:56 - 00:19:57]** Got it.

**[00:19:57 - 00:19:57]** Hey, look.

**[00:19:58 - 00:20:00]** Look, I really need your help here.

**[00:20:00 - 00:20:03]** We are... Well, we are now locked in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:03 - 00:20:06]** So if I trip this thing, it's just going to show up on your screen, right?

**[00:20:06 - 00:20:07]** No, I'm not going to die.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:08]** No, no, no.

**[00:20:08 - 00:20:15]** You're not going to die, but I'm glad that you called in because if you had tripped it and I didn't know it was you, then, well, I... Well, we can't now.

**[00:20:15 - 00:20:17]** We're stuck in the reactor room.

**[00:20:17 - 00:20:18]** Of course.

**[00:20:18 - 00:20:19]** So...

**[00:20:19 - 00:20:21]** I don't know what's going on.

**[00:20:21 - 00:20:23]** Do you want us to come through the tunnel to get you?

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:23]** No.

**[00:20:23 - 00:20:30]** The only way that you're going to be able to fix this is if you turn off the power and cycle everything and stop the reactor from blowing.

**[00:20:30 - 00:20:32]** Don't waste your time.

**[00:20:32 - 00:20:34]** Hey, look, have you all talked to Narla?

**[00:20:34 - 00:20:37]** Because you're the only people that I've been able to talk to.

**[00:20:37 - 00:20:40]** So you're going to need to let her know that I'm okay.

**[00:20:40 - 00:20:42]** I haven't been able to talk to her for hours now.

**[00:20:42 - 00:20:44]** So at some point, can you just let her know?

**[00:20:45 - 00:20:47]** And can you get the hell over?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:47 - 00:20:49]** She's on the same frequency, man.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:49 - 00:20:50]** I don't know what to tell you.

**[00:20:50 - 00:20:51]** I can't get through to her.

**[00:20:51 - 00:20:53]** Can you just tell her at some point?

**[00:20:53 - 00:20:55]** And can you also fix the reactor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:20:55 - 00:20:57]** I mean, I can't promise that.

**[00:20:57 - 00:20:59]** I will try to relay that message.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:20:59 - 00:21:01]** You're a real gem, Dr. Okay.

**[00:21:01 - 00:21:08]** Look, I need somebody here to get to the reactor and help out.

**[00:21:08 - 00:21:09]** Because this place is going to blow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:09 - 00:21:10]** We are doing the best that we can.

**[00:21:11 - 00:21:13]** If we contact Gnarla, we will let you know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:13 - 00:21:13]** Okay.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:14]** Thank you.

**[00:21:14 - 00:21:16]** I can't promise.

**[00:21:17 - 00:21:19]** Sorry, I don't work for the stewards.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:20]** All right.

**[00:21:20 - 00:21:21]** Well, I do.

**[00:21:21 - 00:21:23]** And we're your only way out of here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:24 - 00:21:25]** He does have a point.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:25 - 00:21:27]** I don't think that's true.


## Speaker_0

**[00:21:27 - 00:21:28]** That's Kevin speaking.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:28 - 00:21:32]** That's assuming a lot, pal, but fine with me.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:32 - 00:21:34]** Jeez, Dr. Elko's picking fights with the stewards.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:36]** That's awesome.

**[00:21:36 - 00:21:45]** Look, so can you... You don't need to go... Can you just... Seems to kind of go in and out.

**[00:21:45 - 00:21:48]** It's a little tougher to talk to him, but you can keep talking if you want.

**[00:21:48 - 00:21:51]** I'm going to tell Bernice to trip the motion sensor.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:52]** Okay.

**[00:21:52 - 00:21:54]** Bernice, trip the motion sensor.

**[00:21:54 - 00:21:56]** You do hear that...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:21:56 - 00:21:58]** What did I tell you?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:21:58 - 00:22:00]** You shouldn't go through there.

**[00:22:00 - 00:22:05]** Sorry, my droid doesn't know how to follow instructions well sometimes.

**[00:22:05 - 00:22:10]** The static, your instructions, it sounded like you wanted her to go into the shaft.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:10 - 00:22:11]** Don't go down the shaft.

**[00:22:11 - 00:22:15]** There's no reason to because this place is about to fucking blow.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:15 - 00:22:19]** Is that shaft access to the other reactor?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:20 - 00:22:22]** It's access to where we came in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:22:22 - 00:22:24]** But you said you could not get to the other reactor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:25 - 00:22:26]** We are in the reactor now.

**[00:22:26 - 00:22:30]** We're trapped in here.

**[00:22:30 - 00:22:32]** What more do you need?

**[00:22:34 - 00:22:37]** I need you to shut off the reactor.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:22:38 - 00:22:45]** But then they also locked the door behind them via the system.

**[00:22:45 - 00:22:49]** So then that's like two layers of defense, which is wise, but...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:22:49 - 00:22:51]** I'll say this.

**[00:22:51 - 00:22:56]** There's no way for you to know why or how this door here was locked.

**[00:22:56 - 00:22:59]** It could have just been locked in general.

**[00:23:00 - 00:23:03]** It does add up that it's like there's a locked door.

**[00:23:03 - 00:23:05]** Gonna put a motion sensor and do that.

**[00:23:05 - 00:23:07]** That's all I'm going to say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:07]** All right.

**[00:23:07 - 00:23:10]** Well, there's no consequence, it seems, to triggering this.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:23:10 - 00:23:18]** So we're saying that they didn't actually go down where we are now, that it was locked from their end, and they put a motion sensor on this locked door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:23:18 - 00:23:20]** It's one of two things.

**[00:23:20 - 00:23:26]** This is all still a part of the gray setup, and the stewards are lying to us because they're not actually stewards.

**[00:23:27 - 00:23:29]** Or they were stewards, but they have little bombs in their heads or whatever.

**[00:23:30 - 00:23:31]** Or...

**[00:23:32 - 00:23:40]** They came down this way, realized they can't do both reactions at the same time, and then when we agreed to go after one, they just left all these sensors in place.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:23:42 - 00:23:51]** I am torn about which one is which, but... You do recall Shay saying before that, hey, if your side is the same as my side, then you're going to have to go down.

**[00:23:51 - 00:23:56]** So it seems like there's probably another shaft that goes down on their side.

**[00:23:56 - 00:24:01]** They found this, and then that would support your theory of setting it up there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:01 - 00:24:06]** Is this the only access that we know of from one side to the other?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:06 - 00:24:10]** This seems like a pretty inconvenient access to get from one side to the other.

**[00:24:10 - 00:24:20]** You do recall that there were teleportation arcs back in the stations, but back in the quarters for the Greys.

**[00:24:21 - 00:24:27]** But it would also stand to assume that there's probably another way at some point later on.

**[00:24:27 - 00:24:28]** It doesn't make sense that this would be the only.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:24:29 - 00:24:29]** Question.

**[00:24:30 - 00:24:31]** Yeah.

**[00:24:32 - 00:24:35]** Rick will ask over the columns, like, Dr.

**[00:24:35 - 00:24:40]** O.K., can you take a look at that door and see if it is any kind of hermetic seal?

**[00:24:41 - 00:24:46]** It might possibly be containment for the reactor in case something goes wrong with one versus the other.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:24:47 - 00:24:49]** Can I do this type of check?

**[00:24:49 - 00:24:50]** Sure, you do an engineering check.

**[00:24:50 - 00:24:50]** Yeah.

**[00:24:52 - 00:24:55]** Thirteen on the dime plus eleven.

**[00:24:56 - 00:24:57]** Twenty-four.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:24:57 - 00:25:06]** Yeah, I mean, it seems like the radiation that has been building up and building up, it seems like that is permeating in general, but this door does seem to have some containment capabilities.

**[00:25:07 - 00:25:09]** To what grade, it depends.

**[00:25:09 - 00:25:12]** You're not sure what the original intent was, but it seems like it could seal something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:13 - 00:25:14]** Yeah.

**[00:25:14 - 00:25:15]** I relay this to Rick.

**[00:25:16 - 00:25:17]** Yeah, I mean, it's a door.

**[00:25:17 - 00:25:18]** It could seal things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:19 - 00:25:20]** Copy that.

**[00:25:20 - 00:25:20]** Thank you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:21 - 00:25:22]** Should I keep it sealed?


## Speaker_0

**[00:25:23 - 00:25:23]** Shh.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:25:24 - 00:25:26]** It's not really a problem with opening it.

**[00:25:26 - 00:25:28]** Like, you just open it and look down.

**[00:25:28 - 00:25:29]** It's already open.

**[00:25:29 - 00:25:32]** I mean, just with setting off the trap, because it's not going to hurt anyone.

**[00:25:33 - 00:25:34]** You already set off the trap.

**[00:25:34 - 00:25:35]** Oh, well then, just look.

**[00:25:36 - 00:25:37]** Just look what's going on.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:25:37 - 00:25:41]** I mean, I'm down to just leave, but we can look down the end of the hallway at least.

**[00:25:42 - 00:25:42]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:43 - 00:25:46]** As Rick wears his character all the way down past the lasers.

**[00:25:47 - 00:25:48]** I'm sorry, as Dr. O.K.

**[00:25:48 - 00:25:49]** does it.

**[00:25:50 - 00:25:52]** Can we pause from the tunnel for a second?

**[00:25:52 - 00:25:58]** Rick is going to move down the ladder just a bit and try to do a perception on what's below.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:25:59 - 00:25:59]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:25:59 - 00:26:01]** While these guys are screwed around in the tunnel.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:01 - 00:26:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:03 - 00:26:09]** I will tell you all in the tunnel, and I'll just reveal it, but it seems like the tunnel curves, just like in the other end.

**[00:26:09 - 00:26:16]** It seems like it curves, and there's another... It seems like the motion detectors are set to go there.

**[00:26:16 - 00:26:18]** And then it does seem to curve.

**[00:26:18 - 00:26:22]** It doglegs a little bit, and that is probably where it enters some sort of...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:22 - 00:26:29]** Just for our listeners, we started off in the tunnel kind of in the middle of the map, very small, and it's a very large black map.

**[00:26:30 - 00:26:31]** The tunnel went to the left.

**[00:26:31 - 00:26:35]** Then they turned the corner to go up, and then they turned the corner left.

**[00:26:36 - 00:26:39]** And now we're kind of in the top left corner of that black map.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:40 - 00:26:41]** This is where you entered here.


## Speaker_0

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:42]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:26:42 - 00:26:52]** Metagame theory, Kevin playing a lot of video games in his lifetime shows that this is probably an area that's going to lead to a separate map is my thoughts.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:26:52 - 00:26:54]** Why don't we just take a look?

**[00:26:54 - 00:26:58]** Rick19, you seem to look down.

**[00:26:58 - 00:27:00]** Maybe you go down the ladder a little bit more.

**[00:27:00 - 00:27:09]** It does seem like below you, there seems to be a larger room that the ladder is going down through a cut, like a penetration in the ceiling.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:10]** Yeah.

**[00:27:10 - 00:27:37]** and there's probably another 15 feet down there's a room that you can see is it seems like the floor is pretty heavy and maybe do you like peek into the room or do you just do you just look to see where the ladder is landing and get close to that penetration it seems like the floor is like a different material it seems like pretty heavy do you keep going into the room or are you just standing at the top of the penetration


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:27:38 - 00:27:40]** Let me... What does Acrobatics let me do?

**[00:27:40 - 00:27:44]** I was going to see if I could, like, I don't know, flip upside down and try to... You need to do a strength check to hold yourself up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:27:44 - 00:27:45]** Yeah.

**[00:27:45 - 00:27:47]** Well, I say we get to the reactor.

**[00:27:49 - 00:27:52]** I'm fine to leave this tunnel unattended for now.

**[00:27:52 - 00:27:55]** I'm going to booby trap his sensor.

**[00:27:56 - 00:27:58]** You want to booby...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:27:58 - 00:28:02]** So if he takes off his sensor, it's going to go off.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:02]** Guys.

**[00:28:02 - 00:28:03]** No, nevermind.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:28:04 - 00:28:08]** I don't, I'm just like, I just want to, sorry, just to metagame posit something.

**[00:28:09 - 00:28:10]** Cause like we just did this about maps.

**[00:28:11 - 00:28:12]** Why the hell would there be a shaft?

**[00:28:13 - 00:28:15]** And why the hell would it be guarded if there were not?

**[00:28:15 - 00:28:17]** But I just don't see the point of adding it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:17 - 00:28:20]** So this is like super metagame out.

**[00:28:20 - 00:28:21]** Actually, it's like outside of game.

**[00:28:21 - 00:28:22]** Um,


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:28:22 - 00:28:24]** Let's talk about ventilation design.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:24 - 00:28:30]** In general, you can ask the stewards more things.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:28:30 - 00:28:32]** Do they know more about this place?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:28:32 - 00:28:42]** But if you had two reactors, right, and you'd want to be able to isolate them, so if you had a problem with one reactor, you could keep the other reactor running.

**[00:28:42 - 00:28:48]** So you would have any access tunnel that is between the two, you'd be able to cut them off and isolate them.

**[00:28:49 - 00:28:49]** It's called containment.

**[00:28:50 - 00:28:50]** It's actually a thing.

**[00:28:52 - 00:28:53]** That's my theory on it.

**[00:28:53 - 00:28:57]** I don't know how deep Paizo goes into reactor theories before they write these games.

**[00:28:58 - 00:28:59]** I think they do enough.

**[00:29:00 - 00:29:02]** They at least read Wikipedia, right?

**[00:29:02 - 00:29:04]** Well, can't we just, like, peek our faces down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:04 - 00:29:05]** Wikipedia is always right.

**[00:29:05 - 00:29:06]** If you want to peek your faces down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:06 - 00:29:07]** All right.

**[00:29:07 - 00:29:10]** Here's is just going to, like, quickly look through just to see what's at the end of the tunnel.

**[00:29:10 - 00:29:11]** I mean, we've gone this far.

**[00:29:11 - 00:29:12]** Here's wants to try it.

**[00:29:14 - 00:29:14]** And then we'll leave.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:29:15 - 00:29:16]** And then we'll go back to Kev.

**[00:29:16 - 00:29:18]** You find a room full of gold.

**[00:29:18 - 00:29:19]** You look down.

**[00:29:19 - 00:29:29]** And it seems like there is a door there that has a little opening.

**[00:29:29 - 00:29:32]** That door was open on your shaft.

**[00:29:33 - 00:29:39]** It seems like from looking through, it seems like that door, you could probably open it from here, from inside.

**[00:29:40 - 00:29:43]** You see through that window, you see rock wall.

**[00:29:43 - 00:29:48]** It's kind of dark, but from the light below that's flickering, it seems like you see another ladder.

**[00:29:49 - 00:29:50]** This is another ladder, so we're going deeper.

**[00:29:51 - 00:29:55]** Sounds like that might have been a shaft that the stewards would have gone down.

**[00:29:55 - 00:29:56]** Oh, okay, okay.

**[00:29:56 - 00:29:57]** Or that Shay and his team.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:29:57 - 00:30:02]** So it's just basically a ladder with, like, and it just goes into the darkness.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:30:02 - 00:30:09]** That's what the steward, Shay, described is, I think, what Jonathan said.

**[00:30:10 - 00:30:12]** No, I know, but okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:12 - 00:30:18]** Yeah, it could go up, but any light seems to be coming up from below.

**[00:30:18 - 00:30:21]** And Rick and I, speaking of light from below...

**[00:30:21 - 00:30:22]** What do you see?

**[00:30:22 - 00:30:23]** What did you decide to do?

**[00:30:23 - 00:30:25]** You're going to parkour on the ladder?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:26 - 00:30:28]** I got distracted and was trying to read, but yeah.

**[00:30:29 - 00:30:31]** Is it athletics or is it acrobatics?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:31 - 00:30:33]** Yeah, I'd say athletics to hold yourself upside down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:34 - 00:30:37]** Pretty high for both, so yeah, I'll roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:37 - 00:30:37]** Don't fail.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:30:40 - 00:30:42]** I did a 9 plus 5 for 14.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:30:42 - 00:30:45]** Okay, well, you don't fall, but...

**[00:30:45 - 00:30:48]** I don't think you can get very far.

**[00:30:48 - 00:30:48]** Yeah.

**[00:30:49 - 00:30:52]** You can't really stick your head in to see the room, but you do get pretty close.

**[00:30:52 - 00:30:59]** Like maybe you get one wrong and you're like, oh, this is a little because with the trembling and the vibration, it's like it's a little tenuous.

**[00:31:00 - 00:31:13]** You can make out what appear to be some blood on the ground and it appears to you can see a little bit of a wall and the wall looks a little different.

**[00:31:13 - 00:31:14]** Looks like a like a heavy wall.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:16 - 00:31:18]** Okay.

**[00:31:19 - 00:31:21]** Can I do another check to get a little further down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:23 - 00:31:26]** Yes, but I will say that if you fail this one, you will not do well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:31:29 - 00:31:32]** That's a natural 20 on the dice for the plus nine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:32 - 00:31:34]** Yeah, you're fine.

**[00:31:34 - 00:31:35]** Thank you, Kraken.

**[00:31:35 - 00:31:36]** Thank you, Kraken.

**[00:31:37 - 00:31:39]** Guaranteeing that you will always get a natural 20.

**[00:31:40 - 00:31:41]** That's a strange motto they have.


## Speaker_0

**[00:31:42 - 00:31:43]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:31:44 - 00:31:47]** It's not like our dice are loaded or anything, but they always roll twice.

**[00:31:47 - 00:31:49]** You do seem that...

**[00:31:49 - 00:31:54]** see that the panels on the wall seems to be another like octagonal room, pretty big.

**[00:31:55 - 00:32:02]** You can tell a little bit as you peek your head down, you see in the Northeast corner that there's a door that seems to be on the ground.

**[00:32:02 - 00:32:05]** It was smashed like a big door to your right.

**[00:32:05 - 00:32:07]** You see another smaller door and wall.

**[00:32:08 - 00:32:16]** And in the corners in, in, in general, the rooms are mostly rock, but in the corners, you can tell that there were these dark walls,

**[00:32:16 - 00:32:18]** dark metal panels.

**[00:32:19 - 00:32:21]** Some of them are dented or torn.

**[00:32:22 - 00:32:28]** Likely, maybe those are some sort of shielding or something else because you're likely on a closer level to the reactor.

**[00:32:29 - 00:32:31]** Here's in Dr. O.K.

**[00:32:31 - 00:32:34]** Let's jump back while Rick19 is thinking of what to do.

**[00:32:34 - 00:32:37]** Here, as you were looking through, you see another ladder, just like the shaft you were in.

**[00:32:37 - 00:32:40]** And...

**[00:32:40 - 00:32:41]** No conclusive evidence.

**[00:32:41 - 00:32:49]** Seems like it makes sense what Shay was saying between the two of you, but also you have this theory that could be part of some larger design.

**[00:32:50 - 00:32:52]** So what do the two of you want to do?

**[00:32:53 - 00:32:56]** Dr. K is back closer to the entrance of the tunnel that you looked in.

**[00:32:57 - 00:33:00]** Here's the still on the other side of that little door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:33:00 - 00:33:29]** communicate to here is hey what do you find down there it's just a ladder it might be too risky to explore it if this is all I'm seeing yeah I think we should meet back up with Rick we don't want to spread our numbers too thin yeah we don't want to split the party at this point or at all ideally alright here starts crawling back yeah so we go back to the chef with Kev continue on okay


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:33:29 - 00:33:33]** I mean, with Rick, the murder bot, he might come in handy.

**[00:33:34 - 00:33:36]** Kev, what are you doing here?

**[00:33:36 - 00:33:37]** Said trolls show up.

**[00:33:38 - 00:33:40]** All right, so you all go down.

**[00:33:41 - 00:33:44]** We need someone with experience on nuclear reactors in the U.S.

**[00:33:44 - 00:33:46]** Navy to fight off a troll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:33:47 - 00:33:49]** Fight off a troll.

**[00:33:50 - 00:33:50]** Curious, though.

**[00:33:51 - 00:33:52]** Curious indeed.

**[00:33:52 - 00:33:55]** That they set up motion detectors.

**[00:33:55 - 00:33:55]** Makes sense.

**[00:33:56 - 00:33:57]** But I like your theories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:33:57 - 00:34:01]** I don't like how you said curious and curious as if it's not actually curious.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:02 - 00:34:03]** Stop tempting me.

**[00:34:04 - 00:34:05]** So you all go back.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:34:06 - 00:34:09]** There's a ping for radiation coming from that door.

**[00:34:11 - 00:34:12]** Just going to put it out there.

**[00:34:14 - 00:34:16]** Guys, do you think we should go back and check the radiation room?

**[00:34:19 - 00:34:22]** I'm just kidding.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_05

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:22]** No.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:22 - 00:34:23]** That's it.

**[00:34:23 - 00:34:25]** That's all that you can say.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:34:25 - 00:34:28]** He just takes out a gun and points it at you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:34:28 - 00:34:31]** Keep moving forward.

**[00:34:31 - 00:34:33]** You're upside down in the tunnel still.

**[00:34:36 - 00:34:40]** Okay, so Dr. K, I'm assuming you reattached yourself to the microchord.

**[00:34:40 - 00:34:40]** Smart idea.

**[00:34:42 - 00:34:44]** Here's and...


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:34:44 - 00:35:03]** bernice you're holding bernice here's do you attach yourself as well i don't know if there are attachments that you need you maybe it's just a probably do need mountaineering gear some craziness i'm sure it exists i feel like i'm sure we'll hear about it we'll probably hear about it from yeah discord folks


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:03 - 00:35:26]** yeah let us know it's fine um is there climbing could ask it makes sense well there's definitely gear and there's actually some cool stuff in galactic magic including this rod a phase rod it's cool you one half of the rod like phases out of the reality and then you put it into the rock like you put the face of it against the rock and then have it phase back in the other half and it holds it's pretty sweet um they come in pairs pretty neat um

**[00:35:26 - 00:35:35]** It feels like it makes sense that with a microcord, you could probably get you and Bernice, Dr. K, here's you probably wouldn't be able to also jump on without additional gear.

**[00:35:35 - 00:35:36]** Does that feel like it's right?

**[00:35:37 - 00:35:38]** That feels like it's right to me.

**[00:35:38 - 00:35:39]** I think so.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:39 - 00:35:42]** It looks like there is a climbing kit that grants a plus four to athletics checks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:42 - 00:35:46]** Yeah, because typically you would have to roll to climb down.

**[00:35:46 - 00:35:47]** I'm going to say, Dr. K, you don't need to.

**[00:35:47 - 00:35:48]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:35:49 - 00:35:51]** Because you're on the cord.

**[00:35:52 - 00:35:55]** Unless you have a climbing speed on your character sheet.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:35:55 - 00:35:57]** I feel like I have to roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:57]** Okay.

**[00:35:57 - 00:35:57]** All right.

**[00:35:57 - 00:36:01]** I was going to say that you didn't have to because you have the cord, which helps you to stabilize everything.

**[00:36:01 - 00:36:02]** And here's what you're going to have to roll.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:02 - 00:36:04]** So do I get a plus four then?

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:04]** I'll give you a plus four.

**[00:36:04 - 00:36:06]** But then I don't actually have the proper kit.

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:07]** Oh, yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:07 - 00:36:08]** I have fly ability.

**[00:36:08 - 00:36:10]** I forget I have jet boots.

**[00:36:10 - 00:36:12]** Do you want to jump jets down?

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:13]** Not yet.

**[00:36:13 - 00:36:14]** Yeah, don't jump jets upside down.

**[00:36:15 - 00:36:19]** Okay, so Rick, you are at the bottom upside down, peeking your head in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:36:19 - 00:36:23]** He, like, takes off the jump jets and puts it on his hands.

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:23]** Yeah, that's right.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:36:23 - 00:36:25]** And then he, like, hands it.

**[00:36:26 - 00:36:27]** So here's in Dr.

**[00:36:27 - 00:36:31]** O.K., and give me a climb check to go down.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:31]** Dr.

**[00:36:31 - 00:36:33]** O.K., give yourself a plus two.

**[00:36:33 - 00:37:00]** to that check i got a natural 20 dude baller easy for you man you're holding bernice maybe even just like in your teeth it's it's so easy it's great easy for you to go down i don't have teeth in your mouth yeah whiskers here's how did you do on your climb check i don't have a climb check it's just acrobatics um for me if i don't have that skill acrobatics apologies yep okay all right cool no worries uh 13 weird it's a middling sort of roll

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:01]** 13.

**[00:37:01 - 00:37:03]** You're able to get down fine.

**[00:37:03 - 00:37:08]** Some of the vibrations give you a little bit, give your foot a little bit of like a... Oh, wow.

**[00:37:09 - 00:37:13]** And Rick, give me a climb check to continue down the ladder where you are now.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:37:15 - 00:37:15]** Nope.

**[00:37:17 - 00:37:21]** 16 plus, where's my climb ability?

**[00:37:21 - 00:37:22]** Forget.

**[00:37:22 - 00:37:22]** Athletics?

**[00:37:23 - 00:37:24]** There's acrobatics.

**[00:37:24 - 00:37:25]** Athletics, I think.

**[00:37:25 - 00:37:25]** Athletics.

**[00:37:26 - 00:37:29]** Six plus eight is 14, so 24.

**[00:37:29 - 00:37:29]** 24.

**[00:37:30 - 00:37:30]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:37:32 - 00:37:34]** You all are able to get down pretty easily.

**[00:37:35 - 00:37:39]** And it really does seem like even with the vibrations, you're fine.

**[00:37:39 - 00:37:43]** Especially Dr. O'Keefe, this is easy for you.

**[00:37:43 - 00:37:44]** You get down to the bottom.

**[00:37:44 - 00:37:46]** And like I said, let me bring you over to the map.

**[00:37:48 - 00:37:50]** You see, again, this octagonal room.

**[00:37:50 - 00:37:58]** And as you get down, it really becomes clear that there are three mangled small humanoids who you would think are probably greys.

**[00:37:58 - 00:38:00]** Some limbs have been ripped off.

**[00:38:00 - 00:38:04]** There appears to be blood splattered around the walls and the floor.

**[00:38:06 - 00:38:09]** And the door in the northeast corner has been ripped from its frame.

**[00:38:11 - 00:38:13]** Occasionally, you do see a drop of... Is that the door?

**[00:38:13 - 00:38:14]** Yeah.

**[00:38:14 - 00:38:17]** You do see a drop of blood.

**[00:38:18 - 00:38:20]** It seems like there's some more doorway past it.

**[00:38:20 - 00:38:21]** Just one.

**[00:38:22 - 00:38:23]** Not just one.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:24]** One drop, yeah.

**[00:38:24 - 00:38:26]** There's one single drop.

**[00:38:27 - 00:38:28]** No, there's just a couple.

**[00:38:28 - 00:38:28]** You should test that drop.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:29]** Yes.

**[00:38:29 - 00:38:30]** It's radioactive troll blood.

**[00:38:31 - 00:38:36]** Except there does seem to be a Keshti blood occasionally mixed in.

**[00:38:36 - 00:38:38]** And there's a door to your right.

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:39]** Your immediate east.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:38:39 - 00:38:41]** What is a Keshti?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:41]** I forget.

**[00:38:41 - 00:38:44]** Keshti are the...

**[00:38:44 - 00:38:45]** weird dog thing?

**[00:38:45 - 00:38:46]** No, that's a Tashitaria.

**[00:38:46 - 00:39:01]** Keshti are the red reptilian-like creatures that have, that, you know, grow up and at one point during their life cycle, they could possibly, they could become an Keshti Rivener where they, like, their mental state degenerates.

**[00:39:01 - 00:39:04]** Otherwise, they have a pretty thriving society.

**[00:39:04 - 00:39:06]** They're like an Akatonian lizard thing.

**[00:39:06 - 00:39:07]** Yeah, they're from Akaton.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:39:07 - 00:39:11]** Basically, one of the only monsters we haven't fought yet, so, heads up.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:12 - 00:39:13]** Good point.

**[00:39:13 - 00:39:38]** the walls are a dull stone and there are panels that you can see in the southeast southwest and northwest corners that appear to be like a dark heavy metal again probably some sort of shielding because you're a lot closer to the reactor this is 55 the ladder stops 55 feet down from where you came down the top yeah

**[00:39:38 - 00:39:39]** So what do you guys want to do?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:39 - 00:39:44]** So it's 55 feet down from the end of the ladder to where we are standing now.

**[00:39:44 - 00:39:44]** Yes.

**[00:39:45 - 00:39:46]** How did they get down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:47 - 00:39:47]** How did who get down?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:48 - 00:39:50]** Yeah, I got down on the microcord.

**[00:39:50 - 00:39:52]** How did like here's and... Climb down.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:39:52 - 00:39:53]** We're on a ladder.

**[00:39:53 - 00:39:54]** Does the ladder go all the way to the bottom?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:39:55 - 00:39:56]** Yeah.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:56]** Okay.

**[00:39:56 - 00:39:58]** Oh, I thought the ladder stopped at 50 feet.

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:58]** Oh, no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:39:58 - 00:39:59]** Yeah.

**[00:40:00 - 00:40:06]** And like I said, you can tell that there seems to be some other room or rooms to your right because there's a door here.

**[00:40:07 - 00:40:11]** And from the light that you can see, there's another entrance into that same wall just around the corner.

**[00:40:12 - 00:40:17]** And again, two big smashed doors that lead directly into another space.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:18 - 00:40:22]** Rick is going to use his jump jets to get down there.

**[00:40:23 - 00:40:30]** You can fly up to 30 feet with a maximum height of 10 feet.

**[00:40:30 - 00:40:33]** Can I drop and then use my jump jets as I land?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:33 - 00:40:36]** Sure, or you can just climb down normally.

**[00:40:36 - 00:40:38]** The chamber's about 15 feet high.

**[00:40:38 - 00:40:39]** I want to be cool about it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:39 - 00:40:41]** Okay, anyways.

**[00:40:41 - 00:40:47]** I'll climb down the ladder and do jump jets down as I pull out my... On the last rung.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:48]** Yeah, just the last.

**[00:40:48 - 00:40:50]** I'm going to jump jets for one foot.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:51 - 00:40:52]** Oh, that was so cool.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:40:52 - 00:40:55]** No, the rugs are 10 feet apart, according to John's drawing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:40:55 - 00:40:57]** Yeah, totally.

**[00:40:57 - 00:41:01]** That was scaled for clarity of information, as one does in technical reports.

**[00:41:03 - 00:41:04]** Scaled arbitrarily.

**[00:41:05 - 00:41:07]** Thank you, MechOps2.

**[00:41:07 - 00:41:09]** It did have an asterisk.

**[00:41:10 - 00:41:11]** That was USC that taught me that well.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:12]** That's right.

**[00:41:12 - 00:41:13]** Yeah.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:14]** I'm sure.

**[00:41:14 - 00:41:16]** It's actually, no offense to USC.

**[00:41:16 - 00:41:17]** Engineering is great.

**[00:41:17 - 00:41:19]** But like there's one class that is mech ops.

**[00:41:19 - 00:41:26]** It is like the capstone for engineering, mechanical engineering, actually mechanical and aero engineering at USC.

**[00:41:27 - 00:41:34]** And the entire class, like you do a bunch of cool projects and like you do some experiments with like airflow and blah, blah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:41:34 - 00:41:36]** Digital image correlation and all that stuff.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:41:36 - 00:41:53]** yeah yeah cool stuff but like but the entire class is dedicated to like proper report writing yeah that's what it is and to be fair i actually use that a lot now in my job so i'm glad to be fair every every every like middle manager that i've worked for definitely went to usc


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:41:55 - 00:41:56]** There are reports.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:56]** Christine.

**[00:41:56 - 00:41:59]** No, they're business majors, though.

**[00:42:00 - 00:42:01]** We're talking Viterbi level.

**[00:42:01 - 00:42:03]** Throw up the V's.

**[00:42:03 - 00:42:04]** I got stories.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:04 - 00:42:06]** I don't want to out anybody.

**[00:42:07 - 00:42:10]** But what you do want to do is figure out what you want to do next.

**[00:42:11 - 00:42:14]** You've just explored a strange bypass tunnel.

**[00:42:15 - 00:42:16]** Where it leads, you think you know.

**[00:42:18 - 00:42:22]** Now you're in closer to a reactor level, presumably.

**[00:42:23 - 00:42:24]** Further down, as you've been told.

**[00:42:25 - 00:42:29]** And in this room where apparently three greys have been ripped to shreds.

**[00:42:29 - 00:42:29]** Slaughtered?

**[00:42:30 - 00:42:30]** Slaughtered or something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:31 - 00:42:34]** Can we see how they've been slaughtered?

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:34]** Absolutely.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:42:34 - 00:42:37]** Do you want to give me a life science or medicine maybe?

**[00:42:37 - 00:42:38]** Life science?

**[00:42:38 - 00:42:38]** Yeah.

**[00:42:39 - 00:42:40]** Crush it, Dr. O.K.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:40 - 00:42:48]** 16 on the die plus 13 life science.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:42:48 - 00:42:50]** The way that you feel about Dr.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:50]** O.K.

**[00:42:50 - 00:42:54]** 's skill checks is how I feel about combat.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:42:54 - 00:43:19]** yeah like here's the thing oh i literally can only do two things which is investigate and like uh life science anything that's like intelligence-based skill check i'm uh yes i will do that i'm saying gross but it's it's an awe gross of like that is just you're crushing it like just it look dr k is a well-built character that's all i'm saying you crush it


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:43:20 - 00:43:39]** great just giving your props well built in some ways that being said kev you realize that my monsters have one thing they have to do when they fight you and that is well sometimes they have more things but you know it's true we took down that gray pretty easily because he was like multi-classed it's true just kidding that was an easy fight so you rolled an awesome roll

**[00:43:40 - 00:44:06]** seems like the cuts are not clean seems like probably some sort of tooth or claw and a lot of strength they also do have the telltale cortex bomb explosion uh but it's a lot of the fact but it's a lot of uh yeah a lot of ripping and rending yikes uh wait no that's a good question um dr okay does it look like the cortex bombs went off after the head already died

**[00:44:06 - 00:44:07]** Can I see that?

**[00:44:07 - 00:44:13]** I feel like you needed a full postmortem to really know, but I'll just tell you that your life science was good enough.

**[00:44:13 - 00:44:14]** Yeah, I mean, it makes sense.

**[00:44:15 - 00:44:17]** Like, it was probably... That I would go off after?

**[00:44:18 - 00:44:20]** It seems like they died from the massive trauma.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:21 - 00:44:24]** Well, I mean, theoretically speaking...

**[00:44:24 - 00:44:31]** If you were to exsanguinate a body through ripping it apart, take the blood out.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:44:32 - 00:44:32]** What did you just say?

**[00:44:33 - 00:44:34]** Drain the body.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:44:34 - 00:44:43]** You drain a body of blood through clawing it to death with a ravenous tooth and or claw for some sort of sustenance.

**[00:44:44 - 00:44:48]** And then an explosion were to go off.

**[00:44:49 - 00:44:52]** in a head, I would assume there'd be less blood.

**[00:44:53 - 00:44:56]** But maybe the head's full of liquid, I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:44:56 - 00:45:01]** Without being an expert on gray anatomy, I think that's a really good theory.

**[00:45:02 - 00:45:05]** And I think that supports your claim that it probably went off afterwards.

**[00:45:06 - 00:45:07]** I like it.

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:07]** I like it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:07 - 00:45:08]** There we go.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:08]** I like it.

**[00:45:08 - 00:45:11]** And you learned a word, exsanguinate.

**[00:45:11 - 00:45:12]** I really like that word.

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:13]** Sanguinate?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:13 - 00:45:17]** Please, if you're a listener, try and use that casually during this week.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:17]** Maybe that's not a real word.

**[00:45:17 - 00:45:18]** Casually.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:45:18 - 00:45:18]** We'll have a conversation.

**[00:45:19 - 00:45:21]** That would be how it would be constructed, I think.

**[00:45:21 - 00:45:23]** But yeah, nice.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:23]** Wow.

**[00:45:23 - 00:45:26]** You really look exsanguinated today.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:26 - 00:45:31]** Exsanguination, the act of draining a person, animal, or organ of blood.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:32 - 00:45:34]** Yeah, it's a really easy way to use during the week.

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:35]** Yeah, it's good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:45:35 - 00:45:36]** All right.

**[00:45:36 - 00:45:37]** Dr.

**[00:45:37 - 00:45:41]** O.K., can you double-check the radiation levels with your chemo-lyzer?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:43]** I don't know.

**[00:45:43 - 00:45:46]** I'll have to ask GM John.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:46 - 00:45:47]** Oh, universe.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:48 - 00:45:49]** Yeah, you can check.

**[00:45:49 - 00:45:53]** Man, 14 on the dot.

**[00:45:53 - 00:45:53]** Dang.

**[00:45:54 - 00:45:55]** What?

**[00:45:55 - 00:45:56]** What am I checking?

**[00:45:56 - 00:45:57]** Life science?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:45:57 - 00:45:58]** Yes.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:45:58 - 00:46:00]** Physical science?

**[00:46:02 - 00:46:03]** It's only plus 11.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:03 - 00:46:06]** 25.

**[00:46:06 - 00:46:07]** It's a good roll.

**[00:46:08 - 00:46:10]** From what you can tell, in the same way that there was a

**[00:46:11 - 00:46:29]** impulsive pinging up near that room this seems like the the floor of radiation has gone up a little bit you're totally fine if you were to take off the environmental protections from your suits you'd probably be fine it wouldn't meet the low radiation mechanical threshold from where you are here


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:30 - 00:46:32]** How many, like, millirem are we talking?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:33 - 00:46:38]** I don't know what a good... What's a good scale, Kev?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:46:38 - 00:46:38]** I can't say it's classified.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:39]** Okay.

**[00:46:39 - 00:46:40]** All right.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:40]** Then you know.

**[00:46:40 - 00:46:41]** I'm just kidding.

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:41]** I don't know.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:46:41 - 00:46:42]** I just don't remember, to be honest.

**[00:46:43 - 00:46:47]** It seems like it has gone up a little bit from where you were.

**[00:46:47 - 00:46:50]** Just background radiation.

**[00:46:50 - 00:46:51]** Good ask, though.

**[00:46:51 - 00:46:52]** Good.

**[00:46:52 - 00:46:53]** So there are two doors.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:46:53 - 00:46:55]** Should we peer behind this door?

**[00:46:56 - 00:46:56]** The door to the east?

**[00:46:56 - 00:47:01]** Small little... Can we tell from the door what this room might be?

**[00:47:03 - 00:47:07]** You cannot... You can't see through it per se.

**[00:47:08 - 00:47:10]** Markings, indications, is there a placard?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:11 - 00:47:13]** Yeah, I was going to say the same thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:13 - 00:47:15]** No, there's not any placard.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:47:15 - 00:47:16]** And there's no door.

**[00:47:16 - 00:47:17]** It's this room.

**[00:47:18 - 00:47:21]** This room has the ladder in the middle of the room and then the door to the top right.

**[00:47:22 - 00:47:23]** Or northeast.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:24 - 00:47:24]** Yeah.

**[00:47:25 - 00:47:26]** Okay.

**[00:47:26 - 00:47:30]** And as I went around this corner and this smash door, can I see into this other room?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:30 - 00:47:36]** Yeah, without revealing it, it seems like it is a... It seems like the room is...

**[00:47:38 - 00:47:45]** like bright light seems to be in the room and you can tell that the door is also off its hinges on the ground.

**[00:47:46 - 00:47:48]** It seems like the floor is just the same floor here.

**[00:47:48 - 00:47:53]** You can see a little bit of more of the same thick panels on the opposite wall.

**[00:47:53 - 00:47:55]** So I'm just going to say like kind of stand here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:47:55 - 00:47:57]** I can't like look in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:47:57 - 00:47:59]** If you want to stand there, you can look in.

**[00:47:59 - 00:48:02]** Sorry, I was explaining as if you were kind of peeking around the corner to look in.

**[00:48:04 - 00:48:05]** But... No, I'm looking in.

**[00:48:05 - 00:48:06]** Okay.

**[00:48:06 - 00:48:07]** You want to look in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:48:07 - 00:48:16]** So... Rakesh's artillery laser out and it's kind of like, you know, pitches in a way to carry support in case something happens.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:17]** Okay.

**[00:48:17 - 00:48:20]** And what is yours doing?

**[00:48:20 - 00:48:21]** Yeah, here's this going to...

**[00:48:24 - 00:48:25]** Right.

**[00:48:25 - 00:48:28]** He's just going to, like, try to look through this door, I guess.

**[00:48:29 - 00:48:31]** Like, perceive through it or open it.

**[00:48:32 - 00:48:33]** Okay.

**[00:48:33 - 00:48:33]** Yeah.

**[00:48:34 - 00:48:34]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:48:35 - 00:48:43]** You are able to see that there appears to be a longer room, maybe, what is that?

**[00:48:44 - 00:48:45]** 40 feet long?

**[00:48:45 - 00:48:46]** 20 feet wide.

**[00:48:47 - 00:48:49]** And the light is pretty bright.

**[00:48:50 - 00:48:52]** And you can tell that

**[00:48:53 - 00:48:59]** The room in general looks like it has dark metal panels along the north and the south of the wall.

**[00:49:01 - 00:49:03]** And on the southern wall, you see another door.

**[00:49:04 - 00:49:11]** Maybe it leads into an area similar, maybe not, as to the two one-panel doors that are to your south.

**[00:49:11 - 00:49:20]** And this room looks like the dark panels have some scratches in them or gouges along the walls.

**[00:49:22 - 00:49:34]** And to the south, you do see a transparent window about three feet from the floor looking into some space to the south.

**[00:49:35 - 00:49:39]** And across the way, it seems like whatever door was there is also on the ground.

**[00:49:41 - 00:49:43]** And you can't tell what's in that room.

**[00:49:43 - 00:49:45]** You can see a little bit beyond it.

**[00:49:46 - 00:49:51]** The lights are bright and then dim and then bright and then out and then dim and then bright.

**[00:49:53 - 00:49:54]** And this is what you can see.

**[00:49:54 - 00:49:57]** And it seems like there's another room just past it.

**[00:49:57 - 00:50:03]** You can't quite tell what's going on in that room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:03 - 00:50:04]** This looks like something a troll could do.

**[00:50:05 - 00:50:07]** Knocking down door after door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:07]** Yeah.

**[00:50:07 - 00:50:07]** Yeah.

**[00:50:08 - 00:50:11]** I tend to agree with you there, yours.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:12 - 00:50:18]** Rick will move up with his artillery laser out and do a perception check on the room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:50:18 - 00:50:19]** Okay.

**[00:50:19 - 00:50:20]** I think... 16.

**[00:50:20 - 00:50:22]** Should we check out this room, though?

**[00:50:22 - 00:50:23]** Sure.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:23 - 00:50:24]** Yeah.

**[00:50:24 - 00:50:26]** Yours will open the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:27 - 00:50:29]** Oh, there's a door here.

**[00:50:29 - 00:50:29]** I missed that.

**[00:50:30 - 00:50:32]** I asked if there were any other doors.

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:32]** You said no.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:32 - 00:50:33]** He did say there were.

**[00:50:33 - 00:50:35]** Because I thought you already knew this was this door here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:36 - 00:50:38]** When I said, is there only one door and a ladder?

**[00:50:38 - 00:50:39]** And you were like, yup.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:41 - 00:50:46]** Didn't hear you because, well, as we established, you're my least favorite member of this cast.

**[00:50:46 - 00:50:47]** Yep.

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:47]** It's fine.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:50:47 - 00:50:49]** Oh, I ignored everything.

**[00:50:49 - 00:50:51]** You are the ones that butt the heads most about rules.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:50:54 - 00:50:55]** Sure, Kev.

**[00:50:55 - 00:50:56]** You were in the Navy.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:50:56 - 00:50:58]** I'm like halfway on the GM side.

**[00:50:58 - 00:51:01]** No, you can't do that.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:01 - 00:51:02]** I'm just kidding, Kevin.

**[00:51:02 - 00:51:03]** I love you.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:04 - 00:51:05]** I love you, Kevin.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:05 - 00:51:05]** I love it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:06 - 00:51:07]** All right.

**[00:51:08 - 00:51:09]** So you want to go where?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:51:10 - 00:51:11]** this door here.

**[00:51:11 - 00:51:12]** Can we open this door?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:51:12 - 00:51:13]** Yeah, okay.

**[00:51:14 - 00:51:15]** Because there's also a door next to Bernice.

**[00:51:16 - 00:51:16]** This one here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:17 - 00:51:18]** Yeah, they might go to the same place.

**[00:51:18 - 00:51:19]** Presumably to the same room.

**[00:51:19 - 00:51:21]** I'm assuming they go to two closets.

**[00:51:22 - 00:51:23]** It could be two separate closets.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:23 - 00:51:25]** So, yeah, they're just storage closets.

**[00:51:27 - 00:51:27]** You're going to open the door?

**[00:51:28 - 00:51:29]** Yep.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:29 - 00:51:36]** Yeah, and if we encounter an enemy, I'm going to tell Bernice ahead of time to open the door and attack.

**[00:51:36 - 00:51:38]** Okay, so... Cover us from the other door.

**[00:51:38 - 00:51:39]** I like it.

**[00:51:39 - 00:51:51]** Okay, so you guys are going to open the door to the north, and then Bernice will... Bernice is on standby to, like, rush in and open the door, crack, and give us some covering fire.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:51 - 00:51:51]** Okay.

**[00:51:52 - 00:51:53]** I like that.

**[00:51:53 - 00:51:55]** I like that a lot.

**[00:51:55 - 00:51:56]** Smart.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:51:56 - 00:51:58]** Presuming that this is the same room.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:51:59 - 00:52:00]** Presuming.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:00 - 00:52:01]** Of course.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:01]** Naturally.


## Speaker_0

**[00:52:01 - 00:52:02]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:03 - 00:52:03]** Yes.

**[00:52:04 - 00:52:04]** Yes.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:05]** Okay.

**[00:52:05 - 00:52:06]** Give me one second.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:06 - 00:52:07]** Where did that go?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:08 - 00:52:09]** He's like, where did I put the big monster?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:10 - 00:52:11]** Oh, my God.

**[00:52:11 - 00:52:13]** We're so nervous to open any door in this game.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:14 - 00:52:14]** Yeah.

**[00:52:15 - 00:52:16]** Especially in this place.

**[00:52:16 - 00:52:18]** Hey, but I found a freaking motion detector.

**[00:52:18 - 00:52:19]** Dude, that was awesome.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:20]** Yeah, that was.

**[00:52:20 - 00:52:21]** That was good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:21 - 00:52:22]** That was something.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:52:22 - 00:52:24]** God, I hope we didn't miss anything there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:24 - 00:52:25]** Ooh, something.

**[00:52:25 - 00:52:25]** Yeah.

**[00:52:26 - 00:52:27]** What's going on?

**[00:52:27 - 00:52:29]** Yeah, but that motion detector.

**[00:52:29 - 00:52:30]** Being cautious never hurt a slug.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:52:31 - 00:52:35]** The one thing you found was, like, that belonged to our potential allies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:52:35 - 00:52:36]** I know.

**[00:52:36 - 00:52:37]** It's so dumb.

**[00:52:37 - 00:52:37]** It is.

**[00:52:38 - 00:52:39]** Emphasis on potential.

**[00:52:39 - 00:52:40]** No, I'm just kidding.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:40]** Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**[00:52:40 - 00:52:42]** Our supposed allies.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:52:43 - 00:52:45]** I'm just trying to mess with you.

**[00:52:45 - 00:52:46]** Just to know.

**[00:52:46 - 00:52:48]** You're just trying to mess with us.

**[00:52:49 - 00:52:53]** Famous left.

**[00:52:53 - 00:52:54]** It was a spit take.

**[00:52:54 - 00:52:54]** Famous.

**[00:52:57 - 00:53:01]** John was just drinking his beverage just now, and he just spit all over his bedroom.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:02 - 00:53:05]** Maybe spit takes are the new punishment level.

**[00:53:05 - 00:53:07]** Do I get dice for that?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:07 - 00:53:09]** If you get the GM to spit take.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:53:09 - 00:53:11]** Shay rhymes with gray.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:11 - 00:53:12]** It's too good.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:13 - 00:53:14]** It's too good.

**[00:53:15 - 00:53:15]** Oh, man.

**[00:53:16 - 00:53:18]** I love recording and playing with you guys.

**[00:53:18 - 00:53:19]** This is the funnest thing.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:20]** Alright.

**[00:53:20 - 00:53:21]** This is the best.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:53:21 - 00:53:23]** It really is.

**[00:53:23 - 00:53:24]** It rhymes with great.

**[00:53:26 - 00:53:29]** You all open the door.

**[00:53:30 - 00:53:34]** And I will reveal... I'll do what I do.

**[00:53:34 - 00:53:35]** I'll tell you what you see.

**[00:53:35 - 00:53:45]** Because you see more heavy reinforced panels covering the east, west, and south of this wall.

**[00:53:45 - 00:53:46]** It's a pretty big room.

**[00:53:47 - 00:53:49]** Maybe 50 feet by 25 feet.

**[00:53:50 - 00:53:55]** And there are four broken, clear containers.

**[00:53:56 - 00:53:57]** Cylinders.

**[00:53:57 - 00:53:59]** form a line along the southern wall.

**[00:54:00 - 00:54:11]** You saw something like this, I think, in the first area that you were, that appeared to be some sort of... where you had goo and there were more cylinders, right?

**[00:54:12 - 00:54:13]** Now...

**[00:54:13 - 00:54:24]** There seem to be insectile humanoids that are with like this purple chitin lie among the wreckage.

**[00:54:25 - 00:54:31]** There are three workstations that are connected to some of the broken tubes.

**[00:54:33 - 00:54:35]** And the terminals just look blank.

**[00:54:38 - 00:54:41]** The light in here is dim, dark.

**[00:54:42 - 00:54:43]** Not as bright.

**[00:54:44 - 00:54:51]** It seems like whatever power was in here is not as heavy, but it feels like an oppressive air as you open the door.

**[00:54:51 - 00:54:54]** It feels like it was sealed kind of on purpose.

**[00:54:54 - 00:54:57]** These doors are meant to keep in whatever is there.

**[00:54:59 - 00:55:00]** We should maybe close it then.

**[00:55:01 - 00:55:02]** As you open it.

**[00:55:03 - 00:55:05]** I haven't revealed it yet.

**[00:55:05 - 00:55:08]** There does seem to be a door to the north.

**[00:55:09 - 00:55:17]** On the northern end, as you may be just peeking, look around, seems to be another door, and that's the door that you can see in the long area right above it.

**[00:55:17 - 00:55:18]** It goes into that room.

**[00:55:19 - 00:55:26]** You see, again, a transparent window, and you realize that from the room that you were just in, the long room, it just is black.

**[00:55:26 - 00:55:28]** It's like a one-way mirror, but it's not a mirror.

**[00:55:28 - 00:55:33]** It's just a black glazing glass.

**[00:55:33 - 00:55:36]** And then from this side, you can see through it into the room.

**[00:55:37 - 00:55:38]** It's like an observation.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:55:39 - 00:55:40]** Did you guys just open the door?

**[00:55:40 - 00:55:43]** It's like a... Oh my god.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:55:43 - 00:55:47]** The door on the right... Let me tell you this, and then I'll reveal it.

**[00:55:48 - 00:55:49]** And then I'll answer your question.

**[00:55:49 - 00:55:51]** And then I'll tell you one more thing.

**[00:55:51 - 00:55:57]** The door on the right... You can see... There appears to be some sort of like... You can see through it.

**[00:55:58 - 00:55:59]** A little bit.

**[00:55:59 - 00:56:00]** Even from here.

**[00:56:01 - 00:56:05]** And on the other side, there appears to be like... A bunch of greenery.

**[00:56:07 - 00:56:36]** plants like lush plants over on the other side and i'm gonna reveal it dr okay your question so having now seen these panels on both sides right like uh the that peering down the hallway i said you see black right this black facade yeah and that of stonework yeah that's here and it the the stonework is there but in the stonework there is glazing it's like a window yeah

**[00:56:37 - 00:56:37]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:56:38 - 00:56:42]** So you can tell it's a window from where I'm – like from this side where I'm standing?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:56:43 - 00:56:47]** Yeah, if you were to – yeah, because I'm – Like a limousine tent or something?

**[00:56:47 - 00:56:48]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:56:48 - 00:56:51]** Like from this side up here, it looks like you can't see in.

**[00:56:51 - 00:56:52]** You're just able to peek in.

**[00:56:52 - 00:56:53]** Like an interrogation room.

**[00:56:53 - 00:56:54]** Yeah, because the light is coming.

**[00:56:55 - 00:56:56]** You can't see.

**[00:56:56 - 00:56:59]** But you mentioned it in this room too, right?

**[00:56:59 - 00:57:03]** Oh, the panels that are like these thick walls – so this here –

**[00:57:03 - 00:57:13]** is stone dull stone these panels that are here and also here along the back wall the southern wall those are a dull heavy metal again that's probably some sort of shielding


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:14 - 00:57:16]** But it's not, okay, I thought it was the same.

**[00:57:16 - 00:57:17]** Got it.

**[00:57:17 - 00:57:18]** The way you described it, but.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:18 - 00:57:18]** Yeah.

**[00:57:20 - 00:57:20]** Fascinating.

**[00:57:21 - 00:57:23]** So, sorry, where's the windows at?

**[00:57:23 - 00:57:25]** The window is in this, is in here.

**[00:57:25 - 00:57:26]** Okay.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:57:26 - 00:57:29]** That whole wall is like an interrogation window, like one way.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:57:29 - 00:57:33]** Not the whole wall, but maybe a good, like, let me draw a little line on it.

**[00:57:34 - 00:57:36]** Maybe like here to here.

**[00:57:37 - 00:57:40]** I just made it brown, you know, this here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:57:41 - 00:57:42]** There.

**[00:57:43 - 00:57:47]** I mean, I want to look at these plants and find out what they are.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:47]** Of course you do.

**[00:57:47 - 00:57:49]** But also, I don't want to die.

**[00:57:50 - 00:57:51]** Give me a perception check.

**[00:57:51 - 00:57:53]** Wake something up.

**[00:57:53 - 00:57:56]** I am rolling freaking rocks!

**[00:57:56 - 00:57:57]** Love it!

**[00:57:57 - 00:57:58]** 19 on the die.

**[00:57:58 - 00:58:02]** Perception plus 12.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:02]** Plus 12.

**[00:58:02 - 00:58:03]** 31.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:04 - 00:58:09]** Seems like standing maybe right to the...

**[00:58:09 - 00:58:12]** Standing in the middle of the room, maybe you just couldn't see it.

**[00:58:13 - 00:58:14]** The light's not quite coming through that limousine tent.

**[00:58:15 - 00:58:16]** Seems a little odd.

**[00:58:18 - 00:58:20]** It does seem like there's a figure.

**[00:58:21 - 00:58:23]** And it's standing motionless.

**[00:58:25 - 00:58:26]** Oh, my God.

**[00:58:26 - 00:58:27]** How big is this figure?

**[00:58:33 - 00:58:36]** If I had to put a term on it, medium.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:37 - 00:58:38]** Can you ping where it is, please?


## Speaker_0

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:39]** Yeah.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:39 - 00:58:43]** In this general area.

**[00:58:44 - 00:58:46]** Right here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:58:47 - 00:58:48]** So Rick can see it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:48]** Motionless.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:58:48 - 00:58:51]** I think at least Will can see it.

**[00:58:51 - 00:58:54]** Do you see anything, Doc?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:58:56 - 00:58:59]** Yeah, there's a creature standing motionless.

**[00:59:00 - 00:59:02]** I think you should just close the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:02 - 00:59:03]** Yeah, I agree.

**[00:59:04 - 00:59:04]** No thanks.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:05 - 00:59:06]** Let's close it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:06 - 00:59:07]** Okay, let's close the door.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:08]** Okay.

**[00:59:08 - 00:59:09]** There's no reactor in here.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:13 - 00:59:15]** Well, here we go.

**[00:59:15 - 00:59:16]** I'm sorry, I'm so tricky.

**[00:59:16 - 00:59:18]** Our listeners are like, just go in there.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:18 - 00:59:23]** Yeah, I mean, you're playing on podcasts where you want to explore things and find out more.

**[00:59:23 - 00:59:24]** I want to know more.

**[00:59:24 - 00:59:27]** There's no reason you can't go in and find out more.

**[00:59:28 - 00:59:29]** It's what my character would do.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_02

**[00:59:30 - 00:59:33]** My character's a freak.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:34 - 00:59:35]** It makes sense.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[00:59:35 - 00:59:41]** Well, we're also on a mission.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_03

**[00:59:41 - 00:59:43]** If we close the door, is the danger over?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:43 - 00:59:45]** Nothing appears to happen.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:45]** We don't know.

**[00:59:45 - 00:59:47]** I mean, it could probably teleport for all we care.

**[00:59:48 - 00:59:48]** Or we know.

**[00:59:49 - 00:59:54]** Did I already perceive the room up here that's on the other side of the glass?

**[00:59:54 - 00:59:55]** On our side of the glass?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[00:59:55 - 00:59:56]** Yeah, you didn't go in.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[00:59:57 - 00:59:58]** I know, but I perceived it.

**[00:59:58 - 01:00:01]** There's nothing in there that's going to be dangerous for us.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]** I'm not going to attest to say that there's nothing dangerous.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:03 - 01:00:04]** I perceived.

**[01:00:04 - 01:00:06]** I'm telling you, I perceived.

**[01:00:07 - 01:00:09]** Oh, I just dropped the dice.

**[01:00:09 - 01:00:09]** Fine, I'll do it again.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:11]** I'll do it again.

**[01:00:11 - 01:00:12]** Natural 20.

**[01:00:12 - 01:00:12]** So 26.

**[01:00:13 - 01:00:14]** Do I see anything, John?

**[01:00:15 - 01:00:16]** Do I smell anything?

**[01:00:16 - 01:00:17]** Can I hear it?


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:19 - 01:00:21]** Kev is so risk averse.

**[01:00:21 - 01:00:22]** He just needs to know.

**[01:00:24 - 01:00:26]** Again, you can't see over at this end of the hall.

**[01:00:26 - 01:00:28]** The lighting is not coming through.

**[01:00:30 - 01:00:32]** Magically it's not coming through?

**[01:00:32 - 01:00:34]** No, there doesn't seem to be any light coming through.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_04

**[01:00:35 - 01:00:38]** Well, Rick will step in like 15 feet with Bernice apparently.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:39]** Okay.

**[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]** Where'd she come from?

**[01:00:41 - 01:00:45]** And he's kind of tracing like the wall to the left is just a wall from what he saw.

**[01:00:45 - 01:00:48]** But he sees this like mirror glass thing.

**[01:00:48 - 01:00:49]** Yeah.

**[01:00:49 - 01:00:52]** And he's got his laser just pointed at this quote unquote figure.

**[01:00:52 - 01:00:53]** Okay.

**[01:00:53 - 01:00:55]** As we kind of enter the room and move across it.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_01

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:56]** Okay.

**[01:00:56 - 01:00:58]** As you start to walk across the room.

**[01:00:59 - 01:00:59]** Slicing the pie.

**[01:00:59 - 01:01:01]** Everything appears fine.

**[01:01:02 - 01:01:14]** And then from deep in that dark corner in the back, you do hear this voice that's like, no, no, no, I won't go back in that cage.


## Speaker_SPEAKER_00

**[01:01:15 - 01:01:16]** And that's our game.

**[01:01:16 - 01:01:17]** It's got to be the lizard people.

**[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]** It's got to be them.

**[01:01:21 - 01:01:22]** We're going to help you get out.

**[01:01:22 - 01:01:23]** Maybe you help them get out.

**[01:01:23 - 01:01:26]** So conveniently placed.

**[01:01:29 - 01:01:31]** Hey everyone, it's Kelly again.

**[01:01:31 - 01:01:34]** Thank you so much for listening to Will Say for another week.

**[01:01:35 - 01:01:39]** We talked a lot about dreams and aspirations in our opening banter.

**[01:01:39 - 01:01:52]** And all jokes aside, I want to encourage you, if you can squirrel away some time in the busyness of life, even a little bit, please pursue, at least in some small way, some of your dreams.

**[01:01:52 - 01:01:57]** In the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to take the time to explore and play.

**[01:01:57 - 01:02:02]** But those things are important for your mental health and they make life more fun.

**[01:02:03 - 01:02:06]** And in some cases, they help you connect with other people.

**[01:02:07 - 01:02:13]** In addition to the crazier stuff we mentioned, we also had this dream to try out Starfinder and record us playing together.

**[01:02:14 - 01:02:17]** And the result is what you have heard today and before.

**[01:02:17 - 01:02:21]** If you have the time, explore your thing.

**[01:02:21 - 01:02:24]** Try out that new game or record that podcast.

**[01:02:25 - 01:02:27]** And if you do make a podcast, please let us know.

**[01:02:29 - 01:02:29]** We love you all.

**[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]** So take care of yourselves.

**[01:02:33 - 01:02:34]** See you next We'll Save Wednesday.
